The flare reached Δ U =2 mag but showed only modest enhancements in the  IUE  spectra. The optical spectrophotometry indicated broadened Balmer line profiles during the flare, with H β  and H γ  clearly showing red wings (∼100 km s −1 ). The results are compared with other  IUE  and optical observations of UV Ceti, and their solar analogues. Oxford University Press is a department of the University of Oxford.
