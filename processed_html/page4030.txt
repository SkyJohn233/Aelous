( self.Terraria ) submitted 4 years ago by Hudrty I brought this up in this subreddit before, but mountains are so amazing in real life (just look at Glacier National Park on Google). I see the epic mountains in the background in Terraria, but I wonder what a new biome on the surface could do to really change things. Imagine the possibilities!  -Unique enemies like lizards, or bears, for fur pelts, or snakeskin apparel!-Cave systems made from abandoned mines or creatures!-Randomly generated monasteries at the peaks! -A new NPC who sells mounts! (wouldn ' t riding a mountain goat be radical?)-New accessories and paintings, (It ' d be reminiscent of Tibetan culture for reference)-More emphasis on mud and clay building materials to make those colorful palaces!-Fog and cloud cover because of the altitude And I know increasing the height might be too big of a change, but I feel there should be more emphasis on combat, adventures, and builds above the surface more! There ' s so much to explore down below and all the way to hell, why not even the odds and go up as well! Let ' s have a discussion! Could it work? Post a comment! [–] notjustinbailey 8 points 9 points 10 points 4 years ago (5 children) There was a TO forum thread about this. Each world would randomly choose between 2 oceans, 1 ocean 1 mountain, or 2 mountains. They would make the world feel like it ' s not just an island and it would be a nice alternative to the boring water. [–] merchando 2 points 3 points 4 points 4 years ago (0 children) Awesome! I hope this gets implemented. [–] ShowMeYourCat 2 points 3 points 4 points 4 years ago * (2 children) two mountains  Well and how are you going to kill the ol '  Duke Fishron? edit: well time for a new account. I seam to got attention from some pissy downvoter stalkers. :/ Edit2: thank you guys  [–] notjustinbailey 2 points 3 points 4 points 4 years ago (1 child) okay, maybe not two mountains. but technically you can just say  " then how are you going to kill the eater of worlds "  if you get a crimson world. but then you ' d have to make it 2 mountains or 2 oceans and have a new boss for the mountains so maybe 1 and 1 [–] ShowMeYourCat 2 points 3 points 4 points 4 years ago * (0 children) eater of worlds You could bring corrupted stuff from another world. But you can ' t bring a whole beach. Think about servers. Single player this is no problem you just load another world.  I think one beach and one mountain is the way to go. [–] Hudrty [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago (0 children) I like that idea! [–] UnclePhister 7 points 8 points 9 points 4 years ago (1 child) Up vote solely because you used radical. Good to know others are keeping that word alive. Also I like the idea, could be fun. Stay rad! [–] Hudrty [ S ] 1 point 2 points 3 points 4 years ago (0 children) Rad dad! [–] Gnomesurf 24 points 25 points 26 points 4 years ago (6 children) The world height would have to be, I don ' t know, tripled? Unless they are incredibly short mountains, no. [–] [deleted] 6 points 7 points 8 points 4 years ago (0 children) Yea, I ' ve had hills that reach near flying islands and there is like a post on here a week where someone is on a hill right under a flying island. [–] weepingskull 2 points 3 points 4 points 4 years ago (3 children) Yeah world hight needs to be increased because ive hade a large world where the spawn was just under harpy spawning. I moved up a very small hill and was attacked. I checked and that was the way the whole world generated.. [–] [deleted] 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago (2 children) That leaves you pretty vulnerable to Wyvern attacks, huh... [–] Hudrty [ S ] 1 point 2 points 3 points 4 years ago (1 child) All the more reason to be scared of those mountains! [–] [deleted] 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago (0 children) Hear hear! First time I encountered one of those sky snakes, I was torn to pieces in no time. No sane man should ever venture anywhere  near  Wyvern territory... [–] Hudrty [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago (0 children) It ' s not like increasing the height would be a problem [–] metalgearRAY477 4 points 5 points 6 points 4 years ago (0 children) This idea is a good idea. [–] AgentLym 4 points 5 points 6 points 4 years ago (1 child) I love this idea! If it were a separate biome, we wouldn ' t have to worry about harpies (they could be coded out).  [–] Hudrty [ S ] 1 point 2 points 3 points 4 years ago (0 children) Or just bump the world height [–] sniffyskirt 2 points 3 points 4 points 4 years ago (0 children) I wish the world was circular, so that when you go to the end it takes you to the beginning of the other side... [–] DMKrodan 1 point 2 points 3 points 4 years ago (0 children) Goblin caves would be interesting and world friendly too.  [–] redismafia 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago (3 children) It would be really tedious to walk past a mountain while heading to the ocean tho, forcing you to mine a huge tunnel early in the game :( [–] tzheihoh 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago (1 child) What if worldgen already included tunnels? [–] Hudrty [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago (0 children) Yeah, like mineshafts! [–] Hudrty [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago (0 children) Even now with the Crimson/Corruption, tall cliffs, and lakes, getting around early game is difficult anyway. [–] WumperD 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago (1 child) Great idea. I would love something like that and as you said there are some nice options for world generation, but the height of the world would have to be at least tripled unless we want small mountains. Maybe do something with the harpies. They would be too annoying to always spawn everywhere but harpy nest as a mini biome would be awesome. [–] Hudrty [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago (0 children) I was thinking since the surface can actually go pretty far down, maybe there doesn ' t have to be that much of a sky expansion Posts are automatically archived after 6 months.
