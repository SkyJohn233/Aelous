Born into a family of California vintners - his grandfather ran Inglenook Winery in the 60 &# x2019;s, and his father founded Montevina Winery in the 70 &# x2019;s - Joel grew up in the vineyards, and learned to drive a tractor before he could legally drive a car. Joel &# x2019;s first venture in the wine business was the Palisades Market, a boutique grocery store and wine shop in Calistoga, CA that he and his brother bought in 1993. There, he learned the art of running a business, creating food and selling wine. In particular, he recognized a growing need for quality wines in the under-$20 category. &# xA0; Since Joel Gott Wines started in 1996, they have selected the best fruit from growing regions in California, Oregon and Washington which they blend to create more balanced, clean, complex, and elegant wines. They are geared towards continuing to give customers expressive and food-friendly wines at great prices California &# x2019;s most praised white wine,  Chardonnay  is also the state &# x2019;s most planted white grape variety. Diverse terrain and microclimates allow for an incredible range of wine styles.  Chardonnay planted in the cooler, coastal zones takes on bright characteristics like lemon zest, key lime, green apple and wet flint. For this style, look to the chilly  Sonoma Coast ,  Carneros ,  Santa Cruz Mountains ,  Santa Lucia Highlands  and  Edna Valley . The inland zones of California &# x2019;s coast, such as the  Russian River ,  Sonoma ,  Napa  and  Livermore  Valleys maintain a more Goldilocks-esque climate where both styles go. Early picking retains acidity and creates a leaner style but leaving the grapes to hang creates an approachable Chardonnay, balancing richness and finesse. Chardonnay also plays a major part in the sparkling wine production of the  Anderson Valley  and  Carneros . Update your browser to enjoy all that Wine.com has to offer.
