Top 10 best Freesat boxes for UK TVs: Page 11 | TechRadar By Rob Mead January 08, 2010 Why pay for satellite TV - you can get it for free Humax Foxsat HDR The first Freesat+ HD PVR, and the only serious satellite rival to Sky+ With the arrival of the Humax Foxsat-HDR there is finally a subscription-free rival to Sky+, the de facto satellite TV PVR in the UK. Previously, recording a Freesat broadcast meant resorting to antediluvian methods such as using a separate DVD recorder or VCR in conjunction with a Freesat receiver. The system works almost flawlessly and can deliver top-quality broadcast images and sound.
