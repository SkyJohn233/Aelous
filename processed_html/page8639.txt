Hot Monster - Super Mario Wiki, the Mario encyclopedia The  Hot Monster  tires (known as the  Funky Monster  in the British English version) are an unlockable tire part in  Mario Kart 8  and  Mario Kart 8 Deluxe . Unlike their similar counterpart, the  Red Monster  from  Mario Kart 7 , they are statistically identical to the  Monster  tires; they offer a weight and traction boost in compromise for lowered acceleration and handling. Other than the color, the Hot Monster features circular treads instead of chevron-shaped treads. In  Mario Kart 8 Deluxe , the Hot Monster tires have slightly different stats. They now have improved water speed, water handling, air handling and miniturbo stats, and their traction stat has also been reduced as well.
