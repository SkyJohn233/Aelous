If you don't have wi-fi at home go to a library, coffee shop, or any number of fast food places with free wi-fi to download your app.                                     Oct 17, 2017 2:12 PM                                                                 Dec 20, 2017 7:42 AM in response to MrHansel                                                                 In response to MrHansel                               Go to settings, turn off automatic date  &  time and set the date something like 3 months in the future.
