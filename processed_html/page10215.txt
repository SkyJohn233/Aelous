I am having lower back pain and front pelvic pain both of these are normally when I first wake up. Last night I flipped and flopped all night like a fish! Back hurt all night long. Also the past 4 nights I keep getting leg cramps. I keep reading but everything is connected to Tamoxifen, so I am curious if anyone on Femara has had leg cramps. I go for herceptin tomorrow and I plan on asking about those and the front pelvic pain. Also after tomorrow just 2 more herceptin and I am done!!  Thank you for any input.

Everyone is different but for me most of the bad SE's happened within the first few months. Sleep has always been an issue for me but I do think it was worse during the first few months. Joint pain was the worse then to but I still have it now when I get up from sleeping or sitting for a long time. I don't remember any actual cramps though. I just really think everyone has their own reactions to these drugs. You are still getting other drugs too so they may be reacting to each other. I hope your onc has some answers for you tomorrow.

Even had episodes of frank in turning of my toes (called pedospasm, yikes). I finally got with the program and followed the kind ladies advice here by ensuring I took my calcium, magnesium and vitamin D. It's too early to tell. Tonic water has quanine which often helps with the cramps. But I didn't use it.  Advil did seem to help when the pain was bad. One at night on occasion.  Also heating pad prior to sleep and gentle stretching. Hope you get some relief.

Tender I didn't get my period this month either, so I am figuring everything is working as it should. Just hoping nothing comes falling out from the netherland area!  I am getting me a dove soap bar for under my sheet and gonna try that! Alot of women swear by it for cramps. Or perhaps I may need to get 2 seeing as I cramp in both calf areas. At least if I wake up in bubbles I will know if I am becoming incontinent!  < giggle > Again thank you BOTH for your input!

I wonder if our dear Joan suggested the Dove soap bar under the sheet. Maybe it lubricates the toes and feet incase they cramp too. However, I happen to know she flatly rejected my idea of Crisco anywhere near a bedroom (long story, earlier post). Loved the bubbles! Tiny bubbles, wasn't that a song?

You put it under the bottom sheet of your bed around your calf area and if you cramp you rub legs on it and it stops them.  I just bought a new bedtopper so I put my soap in a pillowcase and sleep with it in legs reach every night. So far I have not had any cramps since my post. I did increase potassium by diet, bananas etc. Also ALL I drink anymore is water. A little juice here and there but mostly water.  Hey I suggest you put a bar in a pillow case and if your hands cramp try rubbing and see if it helps. You will have to report back on this though because you will be a first! I wish you the best! Susan McD  Jan  8, 2008 08:44PM Susan1120         wrote:     Hi Arco, Is your wife done with Femara now?

I am working on the potassium, I am not sure about magnesium though. I take Paxil and I am not sure if the 2 can be taken together. Anyone care to enlighten me?   Paxil is the whole reason I am on Femara and ovarian suppresion. I can't get off of it!  I tried and I became a train wreck waiting to happen! I have been on it pre BC for Panic Disorder for 10 years almost 11 now. I truly wish I had NEVER started it because I don't know if I will ever be free from it! It has and does help me but I am terrified to try to go off it again right now. Maybe later this year I can try again! Love to you Susan  Jan  9, 2008 04:21AM Rosemary44         wrote:     Susan, I wouldn't know if Mg and paxil will collide.  I take Mg for the same reasons you take paxil.  Panic attacks, depression, leg cramps and a whole bunch of other reasons.  Kris might come along.  If it has something to do with a drug she usually can find it.

I have been quite busy lately searching information on the net about Eligard Femara and herceptin and forgot to check back this web site. I also have pelvic pain more intense on the left side, this has started about 1 month after my eligard shot. So I have been searching for info and could not find anything related, so now I read that you also have pelvic pain then may be it has something to do with Eligard. I also have leg cramps/pain similar when I was getting taxol but less painful. I do 60 mins of exercise every day and I find this very helpful for the leg pain. Are you constantly losing weight? because I have been and my oncologist told me this was very unusual and right now I am going through several tests in order to figure out the reason. She scared me because right now I am underweight (44 kg). I lost 15 kg since the start of my chemo. I am constantly eating and I am now quite fed up of eating. Is your estradiol level remains low with eligard?

Taking D, Calcium, etc. Just went back to work after a long winter vacation so I suspect that's part of the problem; I'd heard from a chiropractor that "running around" can deplete vitamins and minerals just like running an actual marathon can. But at least I now know it's related also to Femara.  Jan 21, 2011 01:57PM LCrowe         wrote:     Will also try the Dove soap in bed as well as on the easy chair while watching TV. Interesting!

Also dealt with my head getting soaking wet, had to get up and use a towel to dry my hair some and change my pillow case. I am an awful sleeper to start with and these added afflictions are awful.  I was taking arimedex but had the same issues so my doctor switched me to Femara.  I am ready to take my chances and not take any of these drugs.

As far as the night sweats, that drove me nuts at first too. It has, however, calmed down to the point that it doesn't bother me very often anymore. It was worst the first 3 months or so.

As I was getting out of bed, I had this indescribable pain in my leg. It was so bad that I thought I had a blood clot, or was dying or something. It was different than any other leg cramp I'd ever had, as it wasn't confined to my arch or calf and didn't respond to my pointing my toes toward my knee as cramps always had in the past. After several minutes of bearing weight on my leg, it subsided. Today, I was resting in bed as I am recovering from a nasty bout of bronchitis, and I got a similar cramp, only this one was centered on the top of my ankle and forced my foot upward, so I couldn't move it.  These cramps feel like I'm being taken over by aliens. I assume they're from the Femara. Just as I was getting over the crazy joint pain side effects, now this. I hate to gripe, but I would love to feel that I was back in my old pre-BC body. Thank you for letting me rant, Mary Anne  Mar  5, 2015 10:00AM Kicks         wrote:     I have been on Femara/letrozole for 5+ yrs and I get horrendous leg cramps at times.  However, it is not the Femara/letrozole that is at fault - it is low K (potassium) levels.   1/2 way through 12 weekly Taxol, my K levels 'tanked' and had to go on mega doses of K to keep levels in normal range.  I still have to take K to keep levels up but occasionally it will drop and I have to increase for a while then drop back a bit.  When a cramp happens, I take another K and within minutes it will subside - if I don't take, it will get worse and continue happening until I get K levels back up. This may not have anything to do with your cramping issues and certainly DO NOT take mega doses of K without your Dr's approval as too much K can be as deadly as too little.  I have the approval of my Drs to handle my issues as I do after blood work showed the issue and I do get check.  Mg (magnesium) and Zn (zinc) levels also need to be in proper ratios.
