you can x27 t understand haiti x27 s protests without understanding history cognoscenti close 90.9 wbur more close wbur facebook twitter support the news twitter twitter facebook email life in haiti slowed to a standstill last month when national protests began once again in the face of a rising cost of living and a national currency in free fall outside of haiti media coverage of the crisis has focused primarily on violence looting and corruption interviews with foreign volunteers tourists and missionaries highlight that they are trapped or stranded and that in some cases they have been evacuated by helicopters as if from a war zone the u.s. department of state has urged citizens not to travel to haiti due to crime and civil unrest the core group representatives from the u.n. european union organization of american states and six countries including the u.s. issued a statement deploring violence and property damage and stressing that change must come through the ballot box we are doctors who divide our time between boston and rural haiti where we work in hiv clinics staffed by haitian physicians nurses pharmacists social workers and community health workers supported by partners in health and its sister organization zanmi lasante we have witnessed the impacts of the worsening economic state in haiti over the past few years and we were in haiti during the most recent protests and during those in the fall of 2018 we believe that the prevailing characterizations of the deteriorating situation in haiti by the american media and government are inadequately informed by history and that a broader view reframing of the crisis is essential although some of the demonstrations have turned violent most have been peaceful the demonstrators are calling for the resignation of haiti s president jovenel moïse arguing that he has failed to deliver on promises to improve the country s economic conditions at the center of the anti-government movement are accusations of mismanagement and the theft of 2 billion from petrocaribe a discount oil program operated by venezuela and intended to generate savings to fund socioeconomic development however it is clear that the petrocaribe corruption is just one of many factors that have led to the economic despair voiced by the thousands of haitians who have taken to the streets or desperately sought refuge outside of haiti the impoverishment of haiti has not been accidental it can not be explained only by the recent actions of corrupt haitian government officials and it can not be understood without examining historical events since haiti won its independence from france in 1804 the only nation founded as the result of a slave revolution a series of policies by foreign entities have stifled development and precipitated economic catastrophe in 1825 france in exchange for recognizing haiti s sovereignty extorted today s equivalent of 21.7 billion from haiti paid over a period of 122 years as compensation for lost property the bodies of the haitians themselves haiti 's subsequent crippling debt prompted the u.s. to invade haiti in 1915 and occupy the country for 19 years the u.s. expropriated the holdings of haiti s treasury designated 40 percent of haiti s national output towards debt repayment enforced a system of forced labor and murdered thousands of haitians who resisted the occupying forces the impoverishment of haiti has not been accidental haiti s more recent history has been marked by substantial involvement of foreign states in its democratic processes for the past three decades the u.s. consistent with its practices throughout latin america has wielded foreign aid forced tariff reductions and financed coup d'etats to ensure that haiti remains aligned with u.s. interests the current protests can be understood in part as the demonstrators lack of confidence in an electoral process they view as fraudulent and influenced by outsiders current international events have also influenced haiti 's protests president trump has made offensive stigmatizing and false statements about haiti and haitian-americans and his administration s haiti policy can be summarized by an attempt to end temporary protected status tps for some 59,000 haitians who have lived and worked legally in the u.s. since the 2010 earthquake in haiti although the u.n. has admitted responsibility for introducing cholera to haiti creating an epidemic that has killed more than 10,000 haitians u.n. countries have pledged a pitiful amount of funds to address the problem finally many haitians see their government s recent vote to no longer recognize venezuela s president a decision they view as a political maneuver orchestrated by the u.s. against haiti s long-standing ally as another reason for the ongoing protests to describe the haitian protests as merely anti-corruption is to willfully ignore the complicity of the u.s. in installing and upholding corrupt leaders in haiti for its own benefit to focus on the impact of violent protests on a few americans and canadians in haiti is to obscure the structural violence that u.s. policies have levied on haiti throughout its history the current crisis can only be understood after acknowledging the culpability of foreign countries and centering the discussion on the experience of haitians who are disadvantaged by complex systems of power we stand in solidarity with our haitian colleagues patients and friends who live the daily reality of the conditions brought about by the centuries of history we have only briefly touched upon as guests in haiti we hold ourselves accountable for interrogating the ways in which the republic of ngos undermines haiti s development and we are committed to working to support public institutions as americans we petition our government to reverse the unjust termination of temporary protected status for the haitian people who are now a part of our communities we implore the american media and public to pay close attention to our government s ongoing role in the events that are unfolding and to insist on accountability when warranted anne beckett cognoscenti contributor
