Very Fast Interactive Visualization of Large Sets of High-dimensional Data - ScienceDirect ScienceDirect The embedding of high-dimensional data into 2D/3D space is the most popular way of data visualization. Despite recent advances in developing of very accurate dimensionality reduction algorithms, such as BH-SNE, Q-SNE and LoCH, their relatively high computational complex- ity still remains the obstacle for interactive visualization of truly large datasets consisting of  M < 10 6+  of high-dimensional  N  <  10 3+  feature vectors. We show that a new clone of the multidimensional scaling (MDS)– nr -MDS–can be up to two orders of magnitude faster than the modern dimensionality reduction algorithms. We postulate its linear  O ( M)  computational and memory complexities. Simultaneously, our method preserves in 2D/3D target spaces high separability of data, similar to that obtained by the state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction algorithms. We present the effects of  nr -MDS application in visualization of data repositories such as 20 Newsgroups ( M  = 1 . 8 ·10 4 ), MNIST ( M  = 7·10 4 ) and REUTERS ( M  = 2 . 67·10 5 ).
