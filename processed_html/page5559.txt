Java Transformer - SwitchYard - Project Documentation Editor {0} There are two methods available for creating a Java-based transformer in SwitchYard: When using the  @Transformer  annotation, the SwitchYard maven plugin will automatically generate the  < transform.java >  definition(s) for you and add them to the switchyard.xml packaged in your application.  The following Java class would produce the  < transform.java >  definition provided above: The optional  from  and  to  elements of the  @Transformer  annotation can be used to specify the qualified type name used during transformer registration.  If not supplied, the full class name of the method parameter will be used as the from type and the full class name of the return type will be used as the to type. The CDI bean name specified by  @Named  annotation is used to resolve transformer class. If you don't specify, then class name of the transformer is used instead like following: Note that both of above  < transform.java >  definition has a  bean  attribute or a  class  attribute.  bean  attribute and  class  attribute are mutually exclusive.
