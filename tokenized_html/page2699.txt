2007 there is a nice blend of banjo autoharp guitar and fiddle as always grab your guitar and try it out you ll be glad that you did blessings today s tune is blackberry blossom this is a tune that i had to work up the courage to tackle the b part is not bad but the a part is much more difficult the key here is to just take it as slowly as you need to get the patterns down and to play it cleanly blackberry blossom is challenging on any instrument one way that i found to make it easier on the guitar was to go up the neck for the above the staff notes so you ll see that you will play up at the 7th and 8th frets in measures 1,2 5 6 in the a part and measure 4 in the b part even though it looks scary it s really easier than the stretches is you play it at the normal position here is the guitar tab and notation blackberry blossom gtr tab there were a million videos to choose from so i chose this one because of the banjo as always now is a great time to grab your guitar and try this

has changed to duck s eyeball even though it s a really weird name in any event it s a really great tune that i found on youtube being played by rich hartness and friends it is crooked meaning that it has some differently timed measure or more or less measures than the standard 8 per a and b part this has a 2/4 measure at the second ending of the a part and if you listen to the video below you ll easily hear it lots of old-time fiddle tunes have crooked things in them which makes them fun and challenging to play here is the guitar tab and notation duck s eyeball gtr tab and the video mentioned
