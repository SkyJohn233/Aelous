for a weekend my mom sister and i would have a special celebration called bachelorette weekend we would make soup on friday after school watch girlie movies and sit under a blanket with all the lights off saturday we would bake cookies from scratch the only way to fly and make lasagna and go on an outing to a museum or park sunday we would sleep in then go for a walk it was so much fun kinda

watching tv after dinner saturday and sunday nights with tamar and salpy s family and my family together our parents would play poker and i remember watching in living color the most with tamar as well as being upstairs in my bedroom which was directly above where they played cards we d press our ears to the floor and find out if they were talking about us then we d run downstairs and yell at em if they were saying anything questionable lol it was all in good fun running in the ditches and hopping fences with daniel brian dan marc matt billy and julie fudge pops after school making dozens of lehmajuin from scratch on sundays with my parents it was an all day event but that meant awesome after school snacks for months i m grateful for having grown up where i did honestly the main thing
