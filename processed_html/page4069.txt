How to Update AT & T or Verizon Galaxy S4 with TWRP v.2.8.4.0! | GalaxyS4Root.com How To Root Galaxy S4, custom ROMs, and more! by  Max Lee  April 26, 2015 This tutorial is for those of you with Loki d unlocked bootloader on the AT & T SGH-i337 or Verizon SCH-i545, DO NOT FOLLOW THIS GUIDE IF YOU HAVE ANDROID 4.3 OR HIGHER ON AT & T OR VERIZON.  If you already have CWM or TWRP recovery installed, that means you can follow this guide.  If you have Safestrap recovery, that means your phone is on the locked bootloader so DO NOT FOLLOW THIS GUIDE! If you want to install latest Lollipop AOSP ROMs like CM12 or CM12.1, you will need to upgrade your recovery to latest TWRP recovery, I recommend TWRP v2.8.4.0, which I have tested is very stable and also lets you automatically mount to your computer as MTP or connect your flash drives via USB flash drives. To install, you will need a rooted AT & T or Verizon Galaxy S4, then download the following TWRP image files onto your phone: Download TWRP v.2.8.4.0 for AT & T Galaxy S4 SGH-i337   Link Download TWRP v.2.8.4.0 for Verizon Galaxy S4 SCH-i545  Link Then use Terminal Emulator app and type: su For AT & T: dd if=/sdcard/Download/twrp-2.8.4.0-jflteatt.img of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p21 For Verizon: dd if=/sdcard/Download/twrp-2.8.4.0-jfltevzw.img of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p21 DO NOT USE FLASHIFY, IT WILL BRICK YOUR PHONE as recovery for Loki d devices are different. That s it, try rebooting into recovery and you should have latest TWRP v2.8.4.0, now you can install any Lollipop custom ROMs or even older KitKat ROMs too.

I can t get TWRP to install. I keep getting an error  no such file/directory  or something to that effect. I had to install the file on my SD card via a card reader rather than via USB, because when I tried copying via the latter, it would just stay on copy mode with nothing on the progress bar. I seem to be able to copy other files via USB just fine. I quadruple-checked that I was typing in the commands correctly. I typed su, then hit enter, then typed in dd if=/sdcard/Download/twrp-2.8.4.0-jflteatt.img of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p21 exactly like that. Any ideas? Thanks. BTW   this is what my phone is/running >SGH-i337<br >Android 4.2.2 >Baseband I337UCUAMDL< p> Reply timekeeper says: December 6, 2015 at 10:59 am I got excited when I opened this message! I had been waiting for marshmellow for my att s4!! I set up to get started right away. Read through the whole thing before getting to work. That s where my excitement crashed! It s all so confusing to me about bootloaders and all the LOKI eda and old bootloader, safe strap to the man on the moon! Could you maybe dumb it down enough for us tech-hack beginners? I really like the enthusiasm and zest that you feel for android owners. I bet Apple owners are jealous I would really lie to up my i337 to 6.0, but I m not sure I know which end is up now.
