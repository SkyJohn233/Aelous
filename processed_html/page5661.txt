Jade Trimmer - Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, University of Victoria | about.me Two years ago I graduated from the University of Victoria and moved east to the Greater Toronto Area. I put my degree in Political Science and Economic Policy to use by working first for the provincial government and then for the private non-profit sector. I am grateful for these experiences but now have a more clear idea of my ideal career. With a strong longing to be back on the West Coast I am currently in the process of moving my little family back to Victoria BC and searching for a career in the Event Planning industry. I couldn't help but realize that throughout my work experiences and extra curricular initiatives, my event coordination capacities were always highlights for me. I believe that my creative ideas and attention to detail would be an asset to the event industry. I am extremely dedicated and passionate in all facets of my life. I have demonstrated this through my leadership and team roles within my extracurricular involvements, my versatility and drive within the workplace and by travelling the world to explore different ways of life. I am organized, professional, positive and extremely excited to move my career forward. I strive in environments where I can contribute to a team or demonstrate above and beyond individual performance. If youâ€™d like to connect, feel free to say hello through my media links below.
