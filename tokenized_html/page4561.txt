novel plasmon-assisted absorption engineering based on layered metallic nanostructures materials research innovations vol 19 no sup4 optical properties of the compound multilayer metallic nanostructures are investigated both numerically and theoretically with the introduction of the trenches the author reports the enhanced optical transmission eot peak observed in the smooth multilayer metallic grating is completely suppressed and extraordinary optical absorption eoa is obtained which is accompanied with a vortex-like resonance to reveal the underlying physics of the switching from eot to eoa a semianalytical model is proposed based on the lateral and vertical plasmon coupling which shows good agreement with the simulation results our study may provide an alternative way for steering the transmission and/or absorption properties of light which might be of potential applications for thermal emitters infrared imaging and detectors registered in england wales no 3099067 5 howick place london sw1p 1wg we use cookies to improve your website experience to learn about our use of cookies and how you can manage your cookie settings please see our cookie policy by closing this message you are consenting to our use of cookies
