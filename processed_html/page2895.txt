Crema De Maizena (Cornstarch Vanilla Custard) | Cooked by an Angel As a small boy, my mom would make this delectable custard before bed time for me. I recently had the chance to revisit my childhood, when I thought of her and this amazing and simple custard. People in our lives may fade, but their memories and lessons live on and this is one for the books for me. My mom taught me this recipe sometime ago in the eighties and I had to have it the other night when I couldn t think of what to have for a snack before bed. This all may sound cheesy or run of the mill, but I m sure some of you can relate. It s these small recipes that can bring us right back to some of the best times in our lives. This one for me did just that.
