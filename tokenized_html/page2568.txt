uncle stan who 's flying in for thanksgiving and wants to drive the hills to the airport at the dallas airport bill drops them off and leaves and a skycap asks hank if his bags have been out of his sight hank tells them that he may have had his back turned for a minute but peggy tells them to just say they were in his sight but hank says that he ca n't say that he could be committing perjury which alarms the skycap after they get security to check the bag he asks if there 's anything else they are bring onto the plane hank proudly tells him that he 's bringing along a small bottle of propane he has to put it in a locker this was even before tighter security measures were put in place after september 11 2001 he then buys a ticket for luanne although since he bought it on the day of travel rather than six months ago he paid 719 instead of 250 which irritated him meanwhile outside of the airport the gribbles are dropping off john redcorn who is visiting family in arizona and when dale asked him if your people celebrate thanksgiving he says 'we did once as he starts to walk into the terminal nancy decides to get out and make sure he gets off all right after seeing the souphaniousinphones for a second and calling peggy 's mother the gate agent announces that bad weather will force the delay of the billings flight hank tries to volunteer to make the flight happen but the gate agent refuses and hank angrily leaves we then see bill sad and alone at home cooking a tv dinner for himself inside a large roasting pan when he hears that all dfw flights are delayed he grabs his keys and heads back to the airport meanwhile peggy overhears a rumor from a nearby passenger and thinks the family needs to switch to a twa flight because they can de-ice the planes when hank refuses peggy tries to create a diversion to hank by telling bobby that a second line has opened up at the cookie shop in the food court so she can lie to him and justify switching to twa khan meanwhile has commandeered the wok on in food booth claiming to be from the head office to whip up food bowls for his family meanwhile dale tries to smoke in the admiral club of an airline but a staff member prohibits him he then tries to smoke in an suv on display inside the airport and is caught after which we see that nancy and john redcorn are in the back finally he makes it to the outside on the runways and smokes but a no re-entry sign is on the door so he 's trapped outside after the hills return to their original gate after learning that twa does n't even fly into billings montana they then learn that the billings flight has been cancelled until tomorrow boomhauer heads for a nearby hotel with a stewardess on each arm the hill family tries to catch a bus to the econosuite hotel where a block of rooms has been set aside for stranded travelers but peggy insists that they will not have enough space on the bus bill then arrives to give the family a ride but after he crashes his car into the back of a truck they must walk to the hotel but when the arrive they see that there is no vacancy so they take a cab back to the airport and end up sleeping in the terminal the next day the family gets in line to board the flight to billings but at the last minute hank is required to check the box with his turkey although he wanted to carry it on the plane but ca n't because of its awkward shape the family gets on the plane and sees the crew loading up all the bags unfortunately when they come to hank 's turkey box the security dogs bark at it this makes the crew mistakenly believe that the box contains a bomb so the squad comes out and explodes the box ruining the turkey to hank 's horror by the time that 's done it starts raining again so the plane ca n't take off and everybody returns to the airport angry at the staff hank demands that the gate agent gives him a flight hank is informed that dfw is completely shut down but love field has a flight for montana that leaves in 1 hour and that his only chance is getting on the one airport bus which leaves in 5 minutes the family makes a run for it and hank decides that it 's time to force his way on the bus so he makes the driver let his family on and they barely fit on the bus hank is ready to get to montana but after seeing another family stranded he gives up his seats on the bus so the other family can get on they go back to the airport food court and soon discover that everybody missed their flights and that boomhauer struck out with a stewardess as they all sit around sad hank tells them that although their plans had been cancelled everybody is still all together so they eat their dinner mainly a pizza from papa capone 's pizza hank heats the pizza using his propane tank peggy decides to macgyver
