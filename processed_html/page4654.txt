Note: the  trainer is designed exclusively for the game in version 1.05. Note:  The cheats and tricks listed above may not necessarily work with your copy of the game. This is due to the fact that they generally work with a specific version of the game and after updating it or choosing another language they may (although do not have to) stop working or even malfunction. Extra care should be taken with modifications, trainers, and other things that were not created by the gameâ€™s developers. In this case the possibility of malfunctioning or even damaging the game, which may necessitate reinstalling the game, is particularly high.
