2018 women who mean business kimberly kerr kansas city business journal senior vice president sprint business solutions responsibilities kerr leads sprint corp. s business solutions team working with businesses of all sizes and government contracts for sprint kerr has worked at sprint for 23 years in various sales and leadership positions including 13 years with nextel communications turning point kerr began to see traction in her career while she was working in chicago as a director of enterprise she met with leaders throughout other segments of the business to do her job well and it ended up paying off in the long run my goal has always been not to work in my silo but to reach across boundaries because i think you need the whole organization to help you be successful kerr said collaborating like that you get a lot of exposure … i had more supporters because people would know when there was a job or opportunity my name would come up. lessons learned one of kerr s biggest takeaways from her career is being willing to go out on a limb and try a new role for example when she was promoted to director of enterprise she had sales experience but did not have as much of a background in enterprise i went for the job anyways and was encouraged to go through my mentor at the time and ended up getting the role if my mentor hadn t encouraged me i probably never would have applied for that role for the simple reason that i didn t have that enterprise experience … you have to have the confidence to go into the role knowing you re not going to know everything but you will learn it. starting out kerr first planned to be a journalist so she studied journalism and marketing at the university of southern mississippi but she ended up going into sales landing a job at nextel through an introduction from a friend i don t think you start your career off saying i m going to be at one company for 23 years at one point what was really dominant was blackberry and email if that s all it would have been i would have never stayed in this industry it s just so changing so dynamic and so interesting that it s held my attention for so long. little-known fact kerr and her brother made an appearance on bozo the clown when she was 5 that was the first time i was on tv. 2019 american city business journals all rights reserved use of and/or registration on any portion of this site constitutes acceptance of our user agreement updated 5/24/18 and privacy policy and cookie statement updated 5/24/18 the material on this site may not be reproduced distributed transmitted cached or otherwise used except with the prior written permission of american city business journals
