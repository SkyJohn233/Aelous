tourists lurch between off-field scandals with booze bans and curfews now likely stocksc_cricket 27 november 2017 06:17 pm aest chris stocks is a freelance cricket writer based in london he is a regular contributor to the guardian daily mail independent and london evening standard trevor bayliss england s australian coach has accused his players of being dumb and raised the possibility of an alcohol ban being imposed on the squad after revelations jonny bairstow headbutted cameron bancroft in a perth bar despite the incident being downplayed by all parties including bancroft following australia s 10-wicket victory in the opening match of this magellan ashes series it is clear bayliss is furious that england s tour has been hit by more allegations of off-field misconduct just three days after bairstow and bancroft s meeting in a perth bar on october 29 bayliss had spoken to the travelling uk media about the responsibilities his players had on this tour in the wake of the ben stokes controversy stokes would have been here in brisbane had it not been for an altercation outside a bristol nightclub during england s one-day series against west indies in september police are still investigating back then bayliss explained the squad had been briefed by andrew strauss england s director of cricket the day before they left the uk rules had been set by the players about how they were to handle themselves off the field particularly on nights out. there is an agreement among themselves that they will be doing the right thing and looking after themselves said bayliss. it s a long tour you can t be cooped up in a hotel room for four months it s a case of being sensible and professional. what will annoy bayliss the most is the fact this incident happened on the first night of the tour just hours after the squad had landed in perth the night out may have been sanctioned by team management but the fact bairstow put himself in this position x2013 however innocent the encounter with bancroft x2013 just 72 hours after the squad were reminded of their responsibilities by strauss is not good commenting specifically about the stokes incident bayliss had said whatever rules and regs you have there s a bit of a wake-up call we would have preferred it not to be such a big wake up call. unfortunately for england the media firestorm that has followed this latest incident has given them yet another big wake-up call at the worst possible time already 1-0 down in this ashes series after their 10-wicket defeat at the gabba the touring party are now under siege bairstow has been cleared of any wrongdoing by the england wales cricket board after a brief investigation on sunday night the matter as far as they are concerned is closed yet the story has now taken on a life of its own and england are scrambling to limit the damage no wonder bayliss is furious speaking at the gabba on monday bayliss said we can t put ourselves in these situations however small they are. they have only got themselves to blame any team will take any opportunity to get stuck into the opposition make them feel uncomfortable wherever possible if you put yourself in that situation you are fair game we have to be careful we don t do that in future. questions about england s team culture x2013 and fears they are harbouring a drinking culture x2013 are valid the ecb were prepared to give the players a chance to take responsibility for their own off-field behaviour after the stokes incident but now strauss who is here in brisbane will review the policies on player behaviour nights out and alcohol with team management over the coming days a booze ban appears likely. there will probably be a tightening up of curfews said bayliss. players put curfews on themselves around matches then it s up to me to say we haven t got a game for a few nights you can head out but obviously not be stupid that s the disappointing thing we make dumb decisions at different times. we have to be smarter most people like going out at night and having a couple of quiet ones you have got to be careful you don t do anything stupid if that means not having anything to drink then so be it. asked if he thought the behaviour of england s players would now change bayliss answered that was what i thought after bristol as well they d be extra dumb and stupid if it didn t. players going out on tour x2013 and indeed at home x2013 is nothing new however the fact this current england squad has again generated negative headlines for off-field behaviour is unforgivable it appears bairstow did nothing more than being dumb as bayliss put it or weird as bancroft described their meeting at perth s avenue bar yet the damage has been done see and the touring party have been made to look like a laughing stock by their australian hosts the handling of the crisis by senior communications chiefs at the ecb also left a lot to be desired things had appeared to settle down once play started on the fifth and final day at the gabba with the headlines in the morning newspapers appearing to sensationalise what appeared a trivial incident however the decision to allow bairstow to deliver an off-the-cuff statement on the issue without letting him to field questions was ill-advised allowing bayliss to then vent to the media poured kerosene on a fire that had appeared to be burning out rather than killing the story england gave it legs bancroft s light-hearted press conference in which he spoke about the encounter in minute detail with disarming comic frankness then made england look even more foolish no doubt the ecb will learn painful lessons from this latest incident all the while the stokes saga x2013 and whether he will be charged or not by police back in the uk
