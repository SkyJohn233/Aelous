mass effect ashley tumblr happy n7 day and here s to many more adventures this mission just got a lot more complicated happy n7 day me1 squad shepard beginning and end i love me1 it has so much loot ashley garrus femshep mass effect 1 © bioware edit i misspelled shepard… mass effect turian edition 7 lnc mass effect edition so that big character piece i did for the mass effect coloring book from dark horse i went ahead and colored it myself 1 tali zorah vas normandy – tali is so obviously into femshep that it s not even funny the only possible excuse for this one is that they re mutually pining for each other and too scared of rejection to see it through which would be out of character for shepard regardless of how you play her so nah additionally i am forever salty that someone who s just so damn cute can t be smooched as a lady 2 cassandra pentaghast – have you seen her haircut her muscles god damn 3 morrigan – morrigan s open and absolute distaste for men is such an overwhelming sign of lesbianism that it makes me question what the writers for dragon age were even thinking when they made her character were they thinking i have my doubts 4 jack – jack literally admits to having had past romantic and/or sexual encounters with both men and women so it makes zero sense that femshep can t romance her 5 bastila shan – bastila and kotor s protag are quite literally soul mates i really don t need to say anything else 6 dawn star – childhood friends having a crush on each other and growing up to explore those feelings but lesbians would have made such a good arc y all 7 miranda lawson – other people have made this point before but it s still valid so it s unrealistic that the genetically-engineered-to-be-perfect human being would be straight or british for that matter 8 cora harper – i think there s a fan comic or something floating around out there about this but you do not roll with asari commandos and come out the other side completely straight 9 ashley williams – i can t really think of any reasons why ashley should be romanceable as femshep other than that you can t be straight in space but that s still pretty compelling 10 edi – i actually kind of understand not being able to romance edi and in fact i m happy for her and joker that said i m still upset on principle alone that i don t get to smooch a robot lady some human girls of mass effect the ssv normandy sr-1 comic squad if post.asker_url l10n_str.username_said.replace username post.asker_tumblelog_name else l10n_str.username_said.replace username post.asker_tumblelog_name post.question l10n_str.username_said.replace username post.answering_tumblelog_name post.clickthru target= _blank class= click-through-link post.clickthru_no_protocol post.clickthru target= _blank class= click-through-link post.clickthru_no_protocol this post may contain sensitive content safe mode is on this post contains filtered tags post.filtered
