Hydrogen-atom abstraction from alkanes by OH. I. Neopentane and neooctane - ScienceDirect ScienceDirect Absolute rate coefficients for reactions of the hydroxyl radical with neopentane, perdeuteroneopentane, and neooctane were measured with the laser photolysis/laser-induced fluorescence technique. Experiments were performed at 400 torr helium pressure over the temperature range 287–903 K. The data were fit to modified Arrhenius expressions of the form  k (T)=AT n  exp (−E/RT). From this study, it was found that common parameters could be used to characterize the kinetics of the three reactions. For the OH/neopentane system, an increase in the reaction activation barrier of ≈947 cal/mole resulted upon deuterium substitution in neopentane. Theoretical calculations of this energy shift were performed and excellent agreement with experiment was obtained.
