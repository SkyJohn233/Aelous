ReMix: Artura "Dublin Delight" - OC ReMix Facebook Twitter Tumblr Email AddThis Posted 2005-08-28, evaluated by  djpretzel Lord Liftin' Jaysus, we's outta rum, but don't you be worryin none, me darling man! I knowed we was going ta be short so I brought anudder bottle wid me for I find's meself turrible wid me stomach dese days! ...actually, had a bit too much Merlot tonight (cue Giamatti's classic "I am NOT drinking any f*%^ing Merlot" line  from  Sideways ), so the timing is perfect to post this glass-raising, pub-blazing, Irish drinking mix from yonder kinsman Makke.  Top o' the morning to him.  Sure, Guiness or Jameson's or a coffee of the spiked, Isles variety might have been more appropriate, but the point is, this mix goes where no mix has gone before, tantalizingly exploring the tender nether regions of the concept of "Irish Pub Game Arrangements" like never before.  This is uncharted territory folks... the undiscovered country.  I'm actually half Welsh, so I can lay vague, impartial claim to the type of inebriated Celtic roots that yield such lovelies as this wee gem from Marcus, who also can now at least claim honorary Irish heritage as well, if in actuality he hath none.  Remember the scenes in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, where Peregrine Tookthingy and Whatshisname got up on the table and sang something about a green dragon?  Something like that, with a narrative closer in spirit to  The Devil went Down to Georgia , perhaps, and you'll begin to get the picture.  Instrumentation is perfect, vocals authentic (puts  Pitt's accent  attempts to shame), and there's even a "yaaa-naaaann-nanannanana" section, PERFECT for those so far lost to their drink that they can't be bothered to form actual words, much less remember lyrics.  This is actually some rather awesome stuff, extraordinarily creative and original, and if it's mixed a little hectic it's all the better for it, giving the feeling of a closed in, rambunctious pub bustling with lively townsfolk and copious amounts of ale.  I've never played Artura, and I probably never will, but I love this mix, generally like Ben Daglish's work, and absolutely dig what Makke's done with it.  This melody was calling out... it WANTED to be found + hey-diddled with until it ended up a grand buddy/brewsky refrain, on a parallel with Jimmy Buffet's immortal "Why don't we get drunk and screw", and usable in an even wider variety of family-friendly contexts, no less.  Makke should be proud that he did the finding, and also that he's built up a library of extremely quirky but musically competent and intelligent mixes in a variety of styles, of which this is no exception.  Excellent stuff - no matter how remotely far you are from having any Irish in you whatsoever, you can't be hatin'  on the Dublin Delight.  Dye the river green and don yer clovers, this one's bustin' out, Lucky Charms-style.  â€•  djpretzel   I've listened to this one quite a bit. Thank you~ c:   Great piece that would fit well in a Celtic band.   this is one of my favorite mixes, and will be requested by me if  it's available.   it makes me smile.   I love this. Just...amazing!   Among the most memorable mixes that have graced the site. I  haven't heard this in many years, and there wasn't a single day  of those years that I wouldn't have been able to recall this  tune, thanks to the infectious, upbeat catchiness of its melody  and production.   And as good as the music is, I think the writing is just as  stellar. Everything about this mix seems customised to the utmost  of its Celtic potential, and it just oozes personality and fun  because of it. I don't think it's a stretch to say that EVERYONE  has fun listening to this, and that very few people will  immediately forget it.   Fierce contender for my favourite vocal mix on the entire site,  despite its length and novel approach. It makes it work, and  makes it work scarily well.   Damn this song is good. It's so good it should become an  internationally recognized pub song.   So I have attempted to help give this song the recognition it  deserves by creating a high quality music video for it, enjoy.   Really a fun mix, and not one that i'd really expect to hear on  OCR, so that is a definite plus.   Good production, a fun lyrical tale, and it gets the job done  that it sets out to do. Short and sweet, this is definitely more  of a mood-setter, but the quality is definitely there.    AWESOME!, but it's a little bit short , But it's a great song   Every acoustic instrument holds its own and contributes to the  festive mood at just the right times, like the galloping clops  during the chorus and the claps during the "ya da da" slurfest.  The story fits right in - it sounds like something travelers can  relate to, I eagerly await what happens next, and it even has a  twist in the end.   Sweeps me right off my feet.   *jigs*! Too short =( *hits replay!*   Holy Balls, how is it I've completely overlooked this mix  entirely until now.   Celtic bias kicking in.... this mix is HOT!!!!!!!!!   VERY nice work!   Found it. Heard it. Loved it. I'm learning that the obscure mixes  are the best ones. On to the next one!!!!   This is a gem. Not only is it a great arrangment with great  lyrics and singing, it's also a clean production and convincing  instruments.   Honestly, it's hard to find a better song than this to make you  happy. One of OCR'S FINEST!   ahahahaahahahahahahhahahah   this is just amazing. I usually don't listen to remixes unless I  am familiar with the source. The problem with that, though, is  that I miss out on glorious little gems like this one. Makke is  awesome.   If I hadn't been told this was a video game theme remixed, I  wouldn't have known! What a truly wonderful gem this is! I hadn't  listened to this remix because I tend to only listen to games I  have played, and this incredibly well-put arrangement has changed  my opinion on that.   This is just all-around goodness, folks! I feel like I'm in  another country... in another era...   This is what music is all about. Thanks for this remix!   Edit: The lyrics are genius!  http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01395/   Under the lyrics tab. The night was cold and bitter. He was looking for an inn When the Devil shined before him showing off an awful grin. The demon spake, "You're frozen", and he nodded to the beast. "A fee so small," the Dark One said, "can make your life a feast." [Chorus] "Come within these walls of mine before the frost thee bite. Grab yourself a bottle of wine and drink it with delight. Come within these walls of mine before the frost thee bite. At me table you will dine; get yourself another pint." Well, the young man said, "Don't bother: soon I'll find an inn, Because your home and castle is built on wicked sin." The Devil looked offended as the offer was denied, But still he opened up the door, inviting him inside: [Chorus] The demon kept on preaching: "I can make you whole; And all I ask of you, good sir, is your immortal soul." The Dark One asked, "Are you not tempted?" He said "Not the least!" For little did the Devil know the man talking was a priest.
