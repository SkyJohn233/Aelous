The Good Brothers The Good Brothers, Harry, Walter  &  Bill,            started training in 1924 and by 1929 had become well known in the            realms of physical          culture, and featured in all the publications of the day.  Mark Berry        also used them to illustrate Physical Training Simplified.  By 1930                Harry had turned professional. 1934 saw him being lauded as the              World's Strongest              Professional Strongman at the same time as brother Bill claimed            the title of the World's Strongest Amateur.  Harry at one time worked              for Bob Hoffman                but left to set up his own barbell company. He ran the company        for 37 years retiring in 1974. Harry died in 1998 after many years                suffering                    with      heart trouble - he was 95. Both brothers survived him.
