I'm having problems with the use of the class  NSImage . I'm trying to use the function  initWithData:  but it does not work (anything related to  NSImage  doesn't work). Here is a simple example of what im trying. The  NSData  data is right. My project is a commandline tool of foundation type. The error means that the linker can't find the code implementing the  NSImage  class.  According to the  NSImage  documentation , it's implemented in the AppKit framework.  So, in order for the linker to link the code properly, you need to link against the AppKit framework.  Do this by  adding the AppKit framework  into your Xcode project.
