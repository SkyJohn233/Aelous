After reading about the unusual treatment online, Lizzie Dempsey, 27, from Southampton, Hampshire, decided to give it a go. She mixed her milk with  bath water  in a bid to help soothe the patches of dry skin that had sprung up on her children George, two, and Isla, nine months. The retail assistant claims that, despite trying a long list of lotions and creams,  breast milk  is the only thing that has managed to calm their symptoms. Explaining how her husband Ashley, 29, a retail manager, helped give the youngsters their weekly baths, she said: “I would recommend it because it is a safe and easy way to help your baby’s skin. “Some people might be a bit squeamish about it, but it is 100 per cent natural and we really enjoyed doing it.” Lizzie told how George arrived into the world perfectly healthy in December 2015. But when he was just a few weeks old, she spotted some patches of dry skin on his stomach. Initially she tried to combat the problem – since confirmed as eczema, which causes the skin to become red, cracked and dry – with lotions and creams, but none seemed to work. So, like many mums, she turned to social media for advice. “I’m in some mums’ groups and when I asked about it, lots of members had tried breast milk baths and recommended them,” she explained. “My midwife suggested it too, and when I was looking online, it constantly came up in searches.” Then, when George was eight weeks old, Lizzie washed him in breast milk for the first time. “It worked really quickly,” she said. “From there, I did it weekly. “I found it gave him super soft skin every time. I breastfed both kids and would express and freeze an extra supply for the baths. “I would use around 6oz (177ml) a time just added to plain warm bath water, and swirl it in, turning the water a soft white colour. “Occasionally I’d add some lavender oil for a particularly relaxing bath at bedtime.” Lizzie turned to her breast milk to help with both of her babies eczema.

Having been breastfeeding her anyway, the young mum immediately decided to start giving her baths too. “I did it weekly when Isla was a newborn,” she said. “Then, as my milk supply decreased, I started to do it every fortnight or so. “It really helped with her skin, and I knew there were none of the harsh chemicals that can be in some bubble baths. It’s 100 per cent natural. “I also felt it was a nice way to continue with the breastfeeding journey. It was a really special thing to share together.” Occasionally Lizzie adds some lavender oil and flowers for a particularly relaxing bath at bedtime.

She loved them. “I think it was calming for her to be in my milk. I always found her much more chilled after a milk bath than any other, and I think helped with our bond – although she did try to eat the flowers on her last one.” This is a modal window.

According to a study from Iran breast milk is as effective as one per cent hydrocortisone ointment, often prescribed to treat eczema. Nearly 82 per cent of babies treated with breast milk showed improvements after 21 days of treatment, as did 76 per cent of babies treated with the ointment. According to the  Australian Breastfeeding Association , the evidence from randomised clinical trials is being collected and the results are promising. Five randomised clinical trials have been published since 2012, the most recent in 2015, comparing breast milk application with standard care for four infant conditions: atopic eczema; nappy dermatitis; umbilical cord separation, neonatal conjunctivitis (Table 1). In all cases, breastmilk application was as effective as standard care and in the case of umbilical cord care breastmilk application was more effective than standard care.
