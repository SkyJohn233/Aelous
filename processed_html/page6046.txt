Black screen after reboot safe mode not possible Hi. ><br >After a reboot a couple of days ago I see the windows logo, and then I get a black screen with mouse pointer each time I reboot (Black Screen of Death). I believe it did some MS Updates during the reboot. I am unable to boot in safe mode (same result). I've run boot repair, which says there is no problem. I don't have a restore point available so system restore is not an option. I have removed all unnecessary HW and tried different monitors. I've removed and added the graphical adapter. >< p> I've spent 1 whole day reading forums and tried different techniques but I am unable to boot into Windows. Most articles I found are atleast 6 months old so I wonder if this is a new thing? The computer is running Win7 Pro 32bit with a Nvidia NX7800GT graphics card. I have two DVI wide screen monitors connected but tried using a single 4:3 monitor as well. I haven't tried the system32 folder permissions fix, but as I didn't mess with the permissions I assume this is not the case. Is there anything else I can do when booting in to a command window, which seems to be the only thing apart from loading Knoppix (but I don't know what to do from there either). Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Regards, Peter Hi Peter, I suggest you boot into Windows RE: How to boot in WinRE ============== 1.

Vincent Wang >TechNet Community Support< span> Your HDD is propably broken and you have a bad sector somewhere on the beginning of the disc. You can revive it somehow by using some kind of bad sector restoration program (freeware UBCD should have something.) However, it's going to solve the problem only for a while. Backup all data and replace HDD after that. I suggest you start a CHKDSK on your hard drive. In order to do this boot you operating system with Win7 installation media and start Command Prompt at  " >Repair Your Computer&quot; menu.< p> Regards. Mahdi Tehrani  | Beta Signature  Peter, I am wondering if this problem was fixed.  I am having that problem now and I would like to know what solution you found (if any).  Could you share your knowledge with me about this problem of the black screen? Ginger
