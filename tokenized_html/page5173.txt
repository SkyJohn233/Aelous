review spokesman ghost jacket road.cc the ghost jacket from new british brand spokesman is a good three-seasons jacket it 's windproof and water-resistant nicely cut and smart looking with generous reflective details – a good alternative to the many popular choices in this price range as well as being water resistant and windproof the stormshield fabric used in the construction of the ghost has a 4-way stretch that helps with the fit providing flexibility around the shoulders and arms find your nearest dealer here link is external although the stormshield fabric is water resistant rated up to 10,000mm the seams are n't taped and this can lead to water leaking in around the shoulders during very prolonged periods of rain for short showers even quite intense ones the jacket does cope well but spend a good few hours in the pouring rain and the limits of its ability to cope with the conditions will become felt insulation is good when the temperature drops and when it 's dry and windy the windproof performance of the jacket is right up there with the best the collar is tall and lined with a soft material that adds to the feeling of luxury when you want to wrap up warm and head out for an early morning ride or commute the fabric is reasonably breathable too – i certainly found it within an acceptable range this does to an extent depend on the level of intensity you 're riding at and your layers underneath but choose both carefully and the ghost provides a comfortable warmth without excessive heat buildup to help you out when it does get warm there are two zipped vents on the chest panel and of course the main full-length zipper which has a large ring puller to make operation with gloves easier the fit is on the close side aerodynamic and slim rather than loose and baggy but it 's not just one for racing snakes there 's no restriction of movement in any of the key places and the close fit makes you feel faster even if it 's only a psychological thing a silicone band around the hem helps stop the jacket from riding up it 's a very well appointed design you get a dropped tail and it 's long enough to ensure a good overlap with the back of your shorts or tights the cuffs are elasticated and perform a close seal around wrists eradicating airflow up the sleeves the two large pockets provide enough capacity to transport all the essentials you might need on a ride and there 's a zipped pocket for safe storage of the house/car keys personally i prefer the traditional three pocket layout so i can store a pump and tube centrally positioned in the middle one aptly for a british company spokesman pays particular attention to reflective details and there 's a good smattering of these to help you stand out in the dark despite the black colour of the jacket i especially like the big panel of reflective material along the bottom of the pockets spokesman 's nathan gibbons on starting a british clothing brand 4 highlights from the range styling is understated it 's simple with coloured logos and it all works well it 's not a jacket for those who like to make a fashion statement the ghost then is a good jacket for british conditions and works well as a three-seasons choice with the breathability of the fabric providing a bigger window of operation a comfortable well-appointed and smart jacket for three-seasons riding if you re thinking of buying
