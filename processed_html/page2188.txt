Great beginnings: Big Boy No. 4014 comes from out of nowhere to dazzle us - Trains Magazine - Trains News Wire, Railroad News, Railroad Industry News, Web Cams, and Forms Enter keywords or a search phrase below: Facebook Twitter Email App Pinterest AddThis Facebook Twitter Email App Pinterest AddThis Big Boy No. 4014 spent her last night inside the Rail Giants Museum at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds Wednesday. Today, she begins her trip toward restoration. Jim Wrinn photo POMONA, Calif.   Steam locomotives, whether running all out at full gait or at rest, command attention. One that is tantalizingly close to going onto the stage, even if the occasion is a trip to the restoration shop, is often a mystery. What is its personality going to be? We re about to find out. On Wednesday, while the UP steam crew laid panel track and prepared a way for this locomotive to walk across a parking lot and back to the national rail system, I spent time getting to know this 4-8-8-4. This is the seventh of eight preserved Big Boys that I ve seen (the 4023 on display in Omaha, Neb., has eluded me thus far), and No. 4014, at home for one last day at the Rail Gaints Museum on the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds, is set to win over a lot of hearts. The UP steam crew has a good sense of humor as evidenced by these spray painted signs, reflecting the engine's past, future, and one-time operational home. Jim Wrinn photo She s no rusty hulk. Her boiler barrel is clean, and free of rust or deterioration. The glass in her indicator boards and her marker lamps give an in service look. I have no doubt that when she is restored and running on the main line again one day as a goodwill ambassador for the UP, she will truly dazzle. No. 4014 may have been the most obscure of the preserved Big Boys   until now. Steamtown s Big Boy in Scranton, due to its moves to Vermont and Pennsylvania, and the Museum of the American Railroad s Big Boy in Texas, thanks to its recent move from the Dallas fairgrounds to Frisco, Texas, have sure become well known. But now there s 4014, a locomotive that will become known to us all as  the  UP Big Boy. I look forward to seeing this locomotive take its first, although short, trip toward restoration today, and I invite you to join us if you are a subscriber at  www.TrainsMag.com/webcam  for a live broadcast of the move. For all updates on the 4014 go to my YOUTUBE Channel at richardepom or my website imagesofpomona.blogspot.com Ron, she is sitting at the fence, waiting for the time when the UP will bring her onto the national rail network.  Where is 4014 located today, Dec 4? Your last post was Nov 14/15. Have not heard from you since. Thanks, Ron Jim  &  Trains, Thanks for allowing me, and all the viewing public, a chance to see this historic move toward restoration.  P.E. Great post!             Our community is  FREE  to join.
