Extreme sports enthusiast Clayton Butler dies in paragliding accident | Daily Mail Online         By                    Ashley Collman For Dailymail.com               12:37 EST 18 Jan 2015                 , updated                 17:04 EST 18 Jan 2015         A 30-year-old extreme sports enthusiast who lost his new bride in a botched BASE jump has died nearly a year later in a paragliding accident. It was just two weeks after their wedding that Clayton Butler watched his wife Amber Bellows, 28, plummet 2,000 feet to her death after her parachute failed to deploy jumping off a famed peak in Utah's Zion National Park. On Saturday, Butler tragically joined his bride in death while on a vacation to Hawaii. The daredevil jumped off Kaena Point, on the island of Oahu, to paraglide, but crashed and fell about 50 feet.  He was rushed to the hospital in critical condition where he later died. The medical examiner said he died due to 'blunt force injuries to the torso'. The accident is still under investigation.  In a Facebook post about a week before the accident, Butler wrote that he was travelling to Hawaii to go 'Wingsuiting, speed flying and base jumpin. See if I can't find a snorkel and board for a few days too'. It's unclear if paragliding is allowed on Kaena Point.  Butler's best friend Josh Lloyd said his death was 'a tragic accident and nothing more' and that the couple will be missed throughout their community in the Salt Lake City, Utah area.  'Clayton was one of the hardest working and most passionate extreme athletes I’ve ever worked with. As his friend, I can also tell you he was a very sincere and generous person,' Lloyd told  KSL . The couple made headlines last year after Amber's premature death marked the first BASE jumping fatality for Zion National Park.    Scroll down for video  The newlyweds hiked up the park's Mount Kinesava  the morning of February 8 to jump off the staggering cliff, against park rules.  In the wake of the tragedy, Butler appears to have posted pictures to his Facebook, showing their several hours hike up the mountain that day. It's unclear if the photos were taken from the same day she died, but one of the shows shows Mount Kinesava bathed in early morning light. Other photos in the same set uploaded four days after the tragedy shows Amber climbing up a rocky trail and posing against the scenic canyons of Zion. Amber was the first to jump  that afternoon, and her husband knew something was wrong when her parachute didn't deploy at the correct time.  He immediately jumped after her but could not save her. Even more painfully, it took him four hours to hike out of the park to get help to retrieve her body.  The National Park Service fined Butler $5,000 after the accident, for violating the park's prohibition on BASE jumping.   The comments below have been moderated
