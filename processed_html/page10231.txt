generating pi to nth digit java - Stack Overflow                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 I wanted to know how I can generate pi to the nth digit. I have a couple of basic ideas. So in short, either way, I would need to increase the precision of  BigDecimal  depending on what the nth digit is. How would I go about increasing the precision of  BigDecimal  to nth digit? Also, if there is a better and faster of doing this, can you please point me in the correct direction. EDIT: I just want to generate PI. I don't want to use for calculations. and this is a question about how I can use BigDecimal to implement my ideas of generating PI. You need to use  MathContext  to increase the precision of the  BigDecimal e.g.  It's important that ALL the  BigDecimal s you use in your calculations use that  MathContext .Heron's method should give you 1000 digits precision with only 10 iterations and a million digits with 20 iterations so it's certainly good enough.Also, create all the constant  BigDecimal s like e.g.  26390  only once at the start of your program.
