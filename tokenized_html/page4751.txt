twitter linkedin email print share political shifts and economic challenges in latin america could either boost the region s largest trade bloc or lead to its obsolescence backgrounder by claire felter danielle renwick and andrew chatzky last updated july 10 2019 facebook twitter linkedin email print mercosur is an economic and political bloc comprising argentina brazil paraguay uruguay and venezuela created during a period when longtime rivals argentina and brazil were seeking to improve relations the bloc saw some early successes including a tenfold increase in trade within the group in the 1990s however many experts say mercosur has since failed to live up to its ambitions of integrating the region in recent years some have also questioned the bloc s commitment to democracy especially since right-wing presidents in argentina and brazil have downplayed the severity of their countries military dictatorships in the 1970s and 1980s mercosur s one-year suspension of paraguay in 2012 and indefinite suspension of venezuela in 2016 have also revealed fractures within the group more on trade emerging markets argentina brazil paraguay however mercosur economies have recently signaled a willingness to open to other markets reaching a landmark trade deal with the european union in 2019 after long-stalled negotiations if ratified it would be the largest free trade agreement in the world mercosur was created in 1991 when argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay signed the treaty of asuncion pdf an accord calling for the free movement of goods services and factors of production between countries. the four countries agreed to eliminate customs duties implement a common external tariff of 35 percent on certain imports from outside the bloc and adopt a common trade policy toward outside countries and blocs the charter members hoped to form a common market similar to that of the european union and even considered introducing a common currency mercosur had grand ambitions says cfr s shannon k. o neil it was going to be a customs union with a political side. the mercosur stamp is emblazoned on member countries passports and license plates display the mercosur symbol residents of the bloc are authorized to live and work anywhere within it in 1994 the group signed the protocol of ouro preto formalizing its status as a customs union the bloc s highest decision-making body the common market council provides a high-level forum for coordinating foreign and economic policy the group s presidency rotates every six months among its full members following alphabetical order other bodies include the common market group which coordinates macroeconomic policies a trade commission a parliament known as parlasur which serves an advisory role and the structural convergence fund which coordinates regional infrastructure projects venezuela joined mercosur s four founding countries as a full member in 2012 but was suspended in late 2016 today the four have a combined gross domestic product gdp of roughly 3.4 trillion making it one of the world s largest economic blocs pdf by contrast latin america s second-largest trade group the pacific alliance which comprises chile colombia mexico and peru has a combined gdp of about 2 trillion more on trade emerging markets argentina brazil paraguay facebook twitter linkedin email share mercosur was created in large part to cement a rapprochement between argentina and brazil whose relationship had suffered early on from a competition for regional dominance and mutual distrust of their economic and diplomatic agendas the pair still loom large over mercosur together they account for about 95 percent of both the bloc s gdp and population some critics say argentina and brazil wanted mercosur simply as a trade shield the bloc often is less about opening up but actually about protecting brazilian and argentine industries from global competition says oliver stuenkel an assistant professor at the getulio vargas foundation in sao paulo bolivia chile colombia ecuador guyana peru and suriname are associate members they receive tariff reductions when trading with the full members but do not enjoy full voting rights or free access to their markets bolivia was invited to join as a full member in 2012 but its accession is pending authorization from brazil s congress and is not expected to be completed in the near future one of mercosur s early aims was to cement the region s return to democracy since all of its founding members had emerged from dictatorships in the 1980s in 1998 the group signed the ushuaia protocol on democratic commitment pdf stating that the full force of democratic institutions is essential to the integration of mercosur states and that a rupture in democratic order would be cause for a member s suspension facebook twitter linkedin email mercosur members invoked the protocol for the first time in 2012 to suspend paraguay claiming that president fernando lugo had been removed from power unfairly after his domestic opponents accused him of mishandling a deadly clash between farmers and law enforcement some experts say paraguay s suspension which was lifted in 2013 was politically motivated since brazil s then left-wing government was seeking venezuela s admission to the bloc and paraguay s new center-right government opposed it paraguay s suspension took away its ability to block venezuela mercosur inked economic cooperation agreements with bolivia chile israel and peru in its first decade while trade within the bloc jumped from 4 billion in 1990 to more than 40 billion in 2000 the group also began trade negotiations with the european union in 1999 those talks stalled for many years before they regained momentum in recent years regional integration began to slow following brazil s currency devaluation in 1999 and argentina s financial crisis in 2001 and since then trade disputes and other tensions have flared between the two countries in 2011 argentina canceled automatic licensing for hundreds of imports causing delays at ports and contributing to a 15 percent decline in brazilian exports over the next year mercosur countries have also failed to coordinate their trade policies toward third countries for instance brazil unilaterally imposed antidumping restrictions on steel imports from china in 2011 politically negotiated exceptions to the bloc s rules became the norm the economist wrote brazil alone has one hundred separate tariff code exceptions to mercosur s common external tariffs and the four countries rarely challenge one another to get rid of such carve-outs this has restricted mercosur s ability to become a true common market or a catalyst for trade liberalization despite its lofty goals just as often mercosur has acted as a drag on members ambitions to strike free trade agreements with countries outside of latin america facebook twitter linkedin email share experts say integration has been further stifled as mercosur economies continue to fall back on protectionist policies pdf and show reluctance toward creating value-added supply chains or regional production hubs instead latin america s traditional reliance on low-value-added commodity exports particularly to china continued during the commodities price boom of the 2000s many economists argue that this has contributed to the disappointing growth of trade within the bloc which has fallen since 1998 as a share of members total trade brazil defended venezuela s admission into the bloc in 2012 saying inclusion of the oil-rich country would make mercosur a global energy power but falling oil prices economic mismanagement and an increasingly authoritarian government have pushed venezuela into an economic political and humanitarian crisis as a result more than 2.7 million venezuelans have fled to neighboring countries since 2014 since its admission to mercosur venezuela had failed to comply with many of the group s trade regulations mercosur suspended venezuela in late 2016 citing violations of human rights and the bloc s trade rules by president nicolas maduro s government in august 2017 the group made venezuela s suspension indefinite and in 2019 argentina brazil and paraguay called on maduro to cede power to the venezuelan opposition a reformist desire to deepen trade within the bloc as well as genuine horror at venezuela s descent into an economically dysfunctional dictatorship have helped galvanize the four original members willingness to slowly inch venezuela out of the bloc says matthew m. taylor an associate professor at american university and an expert on latin america s political economy the move against venezuela came amid political and economic turmoil across the bloc corruption probes launched in 2014 in brazil have spread implicating hundreds of the region s political and business elites at the same time falling commodity prices and what critics describe as economic mismanagement have contributed to recessions in the region in 2018 brazil s economy grew only about 1 percent after two years of contraction and argentina requested a 50 billion rescue package from the international monetary fund after years of recession mired in crisis venezuela s economy has shrunk by half since 2013 facebook twitter linkedin email new leadership in argentina and brazil as well as venezuela s suspension have offered mercosur an opportunity to revive its early objectives analysts say the bloc resumed trade negotiations with the european commission in 2017 and officials reached a historic draft deal in june 2019 twenty years to the day after negotiations began the deal which eliminates tariffs on roughly 90 percent of mercosur s exports to the eu over ten years and opens government procurement to suppliers from both blocs must now be ratified by all eu and mercosur member states analysts warn that populist politicians and political interest groups on both sides of the atlantic could once again delay progress in south america most of the trade wariness comes from manufacturers especially auto companies who have historically been protected from european competition by high tariffs in europe the agricultural sector is worried about cheap imports from mercosur countries this is especially true in belgium france ireland and poland which all have politically influential beef producers meanwhile brazil s deputy economics minister announced that mercosur is also negotiating free trade agreements with canada and south korea experts agree that mercosur s future will hinge on decisions made in buenos aires and brasilia brazil and argentina are two of each other s most important trading partners but both countries—especially because they re going through a difficult economic time—would benefit from opening of their markets more generally says o neil the challenge is whether they can do it together. rocio cara labrador contributed to
