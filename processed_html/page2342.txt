J. Geils Band | Biography  &  History | AllMusic + Follow Artist Down-and-dirty blues band with a pulverizing live show, fronted by Peter Wolf, that became a surprise hit machine in the early '80s. Read Full Biography The J. Geils Band  were one of the most popular touring rock  &  roll bands in America during the  ' 70s. Where their contemporaries were influenced by the heavy boogie of British blues-rock and the ear-splitting sonic adventures of psychedelia, the J. Geils Band were a bar band pure and simple, churning out greasy covers of obscure R & B, doo wop, and soul tunes, cutting them with a healthy dose of  Stonesy  swagger. While their muscular sound and the hyper jive of frontman  Peter Wolf  packed arenas across America, it only rarely earned them hit singles.  Seth Justman , the group ' s main songwriter, could turn out catchy R & B-based rockers like  " Give It to Me "  and  " Must of Got Lost, "  but these hits never led to stardom, primarily because the group had trouble capturing the energy of its live sound in the studio. In the early  ' 80s, the group tempered its driving rock with some pop, and the makeover paid off with the massive hit single  " Centerfold, "  which stayed at number one for six weeks. By the time the band prepared to record a follow-up, tensions between  Justman  and  Wolf  had grown considerably, resulting in  Wolf ' s departure, which quickly led to the band ' s demise. After working for years to reach the top of the charts, the J. Geils Band couldn ' t stay there once they finally achieved their goal.                                                          Guitarist  J. Geils , bassist  Danny Klein , and harpist  Magic Dick  (born  Richard Salwitz ) began performing as an acoustic blues trio sometime in the mid- ' 60s. In 1967, drummer  Stephen Jo Bladd  and vocalist  Peter Wolf  joined the group, and the band went electric. Before joining the J. Geils Band,  Bladd  and  Wolf  played together in the Boston-based rock revivalist band the Hallucinations. Both musicians shared a love of arcane doo wop, blues, R & B, and rock  &  roll, and  Wolf  had become well-known by spinning such obscure singles as a jive-talking WBCN DJ called  Woofuh Goofuh .  Wolf  and  Bladd ' s specialized tastes became a central force in the newly revamped  J. Geils Band , whose members positioned themselves as tough  ' 50s greasers in opposition to the colorful psychedelic rockers who dominated the East Coast in the late  ' 60s. Soon, the band had earned a sizable local following, including  Seth Justman , an organist who was studying at Boston University.  Justman  joined the band in 1968, and the band continued to tour for the next few years, landing a record contract with Atlantic in 1970.                         Share on     The J.
