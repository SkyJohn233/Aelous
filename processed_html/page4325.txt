Food Review: Afternoon Tea, The Capital Hotel, 22 Basil Street, Knightsbridge, London | Foodie Explorers The Capital Hotel   London  is a five-star hotel located in the heart of Knightsbridge and as such ideally situated for a post-Harrods shopping treat. Afternoon Tea is a serious business nowadays and we looked forward to what surprises  The Capital  provided. We were met at the reception and guided up to the cosy and relaxing lounge. Peaceful music filled the air and a light breeze drifted through the room. Perfect! We perused the selection of teas available, choosing a Ceylon and a white needle tea.  The teas arrived quickly and were well-brewed, so no need to wait to enjoy. Both were delicious with the white needle tea light, looking back at what we ate I m glad I picked a light tea! It wasn t long before our cakes and savouries arrived. The sandwiches included egg  &  cress, ham  &  mustard  and smoked mackerel p t  as well as bacon  &  mushroom tarts/quiche and my favourite warm crumpet with smoked salmon.  The bread was fresh and the filling/bread ratio was perfect.  The textures and tastes were devine, the bacon  &  mushroom tarts were made with light, crisp pastry and the soft delicate finger sandwiches had a tart mustard that provided a welcome contrast to the sweetness to come. Afternoon tea is often a sweet  &  dainty affair and this was no exception with plenty of sweet treats provided, Decadent chocolate orange trifle, buttery bakewell tart as well as a tart and sweet lemon sponge.  Just when you think it s all over  there is more!  Plain and fruit scones are served warm with strawberry jam and Devonshire clotted cream. The Capital Hotel have also worked with  Sipsmith London Dry Gin to create two afternoon tea cocktails: The Basil Street Spritz: blackcurrant and hibiscus infused tea and Champagne; or the Capital Citrus Blend: marmalade, orange, lime and apple juice, Bohea infused tea and Cura ao.  These sound delicious with the citrus blend making my mouth water.   Afternoon Tea with one of these cocktails costs  35 per person. The Capital Champagne Afternoon Tea comes with a glass of Ayala Champagne and costs  39.50 per person.  Afternoon Tea at The Capital Hotel can be booked  here . Overall, amazing five star service as well as impeccable quality of food, we loved the warm scones and the salmon crumpets especially. TL;DR + Quiet surroundings + Delicious baked goods + Perfect service.
