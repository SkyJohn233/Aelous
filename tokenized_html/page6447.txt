cables which are very heavy duty made for trucks and cost a truckload the thinnest cables are 12-gauge which are very inexpensive and not very safe the best booster cables to store in your mercedes-benz trunk are either 8-gauge or 4-gauge the 8-gauge cables are medium duty for auto use typically 12 feet long and cost about 25 the 4-gauge cables are heavy duty for auto use usually 20 feet long and will set you back about 40 round out your preparation for this job with a decent pair of gloves in the glove compartment and a flashlight or headlamp the new led headlamps are bright

sparks but mercedes has protected you by covering the battery and its terminals you do not need to open the battery cover mercedes has provided you with safe remote battery terminals for connecting jumper cables the battery is under a plastic cover on the firewall at the passenger side the remote positive terminal is just in front of the battery and has a sliding red plastic cover slide the cover as shown in figure 1 to access the terminal the remote negative terminal is a brass post on the wheel well start with the connection to the remote positive terminal on the dead car then connect to the positive battery terminal of the booster car the mercedes-benz manual advises to start the booster car at this point start from the negative battery terminal of the booster car and then connect to the remote negative terminal of the dead car the connection sequence and remote terminals are designed to minimize sparks let both engines run for several minutes with the booster cables hooked up this helps the booster battery to charge the weak battery remove the clamp from the remote negative post of the dead car then from the negative battery terminal of the booster car remove the clamp from the positive battery terminal of the booster car then from the remote positive terminal of the dead car close the cover of the remote positive terminal remember do not let the clamps touch any other metal and do n't allow the cables to drape into the engine area or v-belts if the battery is more than three years old and has had one no-start event it is probably time to replace it if the
