How to call an external gradle script once with all tasks to run from original script - Help/Discuss - Gradle Forums I have two build scripts: Script A (a multi-project build with 6 sub projects) Script B (a multi-project build with 20+ sub projects) The B script drives a third party compilation tool that makes assumptions about being in the root of the overall build. The result is that A  &  B cannot be included in a single unified multi-project build. I’ve been asked to tie the scripts together so that a developer can execute the gradle once in the root directory and have everything build. I figured out one way to do this at a task level: However, with this structure, the execution takes significantly more time than running the two scripts separately. I figure this is due to the overhead of spinning up a separate external build for each task. From the A script, I am looking for a way to call the B script just once, passing all of the command line arguments. Ideally, this would mean just one B-script execution. I am sure this can be done, I’m just not sure how. If I am understanding you correctly you could call the ‘B’ project with the same task arguments used to run ‘A’.
