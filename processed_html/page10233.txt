Marks And Spencer Is Selling 'Modest' Clothing. And That's A Problem Modest collection by Marks  &  Spencer (Image Credit:  Marks  &  Spencer ) Marks And Spencer recently introduced 'Modest Clothing' as a category on their shopping website, and it appears to have caused something of a commotion, both online and offline. The section doesn't include clothes from a new range but features items from their current collections that have 'flowing fabrics, higher necklines and lower hems.' The pieces being promoted as 'modest' have full sleeves, boat necklines, and fall to below the knee. Worn together, they would cover you up from neck to toe. And therein lies the problem.

DKNY had launched a Ramadan collection in 2014 targeting a Muslim audience. Over the next two years, Zara, Tommy Hilfiger and Oscar De La Renta did the same. All of them failed, though, but that's a discussion for another time. M & S themselves introduced the Burkini swimsuit two years ago. We've all noticed the signs and seen more covered-up styles become a trend rather than exist solely as a choice made perhaps out of deference to religious reasons. So, no, Marks and Spencer launching a 'Modest' section doesn't feel completely out-of-the-blue. The only problem here though, it seems, is the fact that it's called 'Modest'. An M & S spokesperson told IBTimes UK: "This selection of outfit ideas reflects growing customer demand. 'Modest fashion' is an increasingly popular search term, as customers tell us they are looking for more stylish layering pieces, with features such as longer hemlines, sleeves and higher necklines." Plainly not all customers are thrilled. British TV is debating the merits:         Will the 'modest' range save M & S? The firm has introduced items that cover the body from the neck to the ankles. They're expected to appeal to women who adopt conservative clothing as part of their faith. Will it help revive the business? We'll read your messages on air on Tue And Twitter is outright offended. Way to go M & S - nice thing see you've found a way of selling your Frumpy lines without bothering to check just how many people you are offending - still no such thing as bad publicity eh?  #marksandsparks #modest #patronising And I saw M & S promoting their new Winter "modest" range. It's actually called that. Wtf? So  #M & S  #marcs  and Spencer's are doing what is known as the  #modest  range will there also be a  #slut  range where an a shame alarm goes off any time an item is purchased An article published on  DailyMail , saw mixed reactions though. A comment on the article said, 'What is wrong with the word modest for goodness sakes. According to my dictionary it means free from ostentation and intended to avoid attracting sexual interest. Sounds pretty classy to me.' A similar discussion on  Mumsnet  went a bit differently. One comment said, "I wish they wouldn't call it 'modest'. It implies women not swathed from head to toe are immodest," while another said, "They should call it 'covered' or something, not modest. Modest implies horrible things about women who don't dress that way." Then again, Marks and Spencer has never been about the latest trends. They've always focused on quality and excelled at providing somewhat affordable but well-fitting office-wear clothing. There's absolutely nothing wrong with collating a style of clothes together on their website to make the customer experience smoother - just the way another website would feature New Year's Eve dresses together and have separate sections for Petite, Curve, Tall and Maternity. Brands do need to be careful about what their actions could end up implying though - all clothes outside of the 'Modest' section are not immodest, of course. But if that's what customers are taking away from this move, we expect there'll be another change on the website pretty soon.
