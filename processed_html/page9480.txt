Research was based on data collected for the graduation classes of 2000 ( n  = 2000), 2001 ( n  = 2056), and 2002 ( n  = 2364), students take the exit exam initially in their tenth grade year. The data explored includes earlier test results from tenth, eighth, sixth, and third grade years, when these students were first identified as being below state proficiencies; history of school attendance; and grade point averages Some data categories were explored on the basis of gender, ethnic status, and socioeconomic status. Implications for continued norm-referenced testing are also discussed.
