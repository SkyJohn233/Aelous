This rainforest is full of tiny, miniature creatures - AOL News try{document.getElementById("aol-cms-player-1").style.display="none";}catch(e){} Everyone loves mini pigs, but did you know there is a rainforest in South America full of miniature creatures? The  Valdivian rainforest region  in Southern Chile and parts of Argentina is one of the only temperate forests on the continent.

The Kodkod is the  smallest cat in the Americas , weighing only about 5 lbs. The nocturnal feline has been  listed as threatened  because people keep clearing away the rainforests for lumber. You can also find the  world's smallest deer  in the same forest. The Pudu are less than 20 inches in height and weight up to 26 lbs. Baby Pudus are no bigger than the size of a kitten. Just like the Kodkod, the Pudu is also listed as threatened because of the destruction of the forest. Another tiny friend found in the Valdivian rainforest is the  Monito del Monte . This tiny opossum weighs less than a pound and lives in the thickets of bamboo within the forests. Scientists think it's related to Australian marsupials because South America and Australia used to be connected through Antarctica. Just goes to show that sometimes less is definitely more -- cute that is.
