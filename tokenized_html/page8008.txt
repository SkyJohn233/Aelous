information we have created a resource to rapidly map genetic traits to specific chromosomes in yeast this mapping is done using a set of 16 yeast strains each containing a different chromosome with a conditionally functional centromere conditional centromere function is achieved by integration of a gal1 promoter in cis to centromere sequences we show that the 16 yeast chromosomes can be individually lost in diploid strains which become hemizygous for the destabilized chromosome interestingly most 2 n x02212 1 strains endoduplicate and become 2 n we also demonstrate how chromosome loss in this set of strains can be used to map both recessive and dominant markers to specific chromosomes in addition we show that this method can be used to rapidly validate gene assignments from screens of strain libraries such as the yeast gene disruption collection the centromere is the chromosomal element that ensures faithful segregation of duplicated chromosomes to both the mother and daughter during cell division the yeast centromere is composed of an x0223c 125-bp sequence that can be subdivided into three functional elements present at all yeast centromeres f itzgerald -h ayes et al 1982 p anzeri et al 1985 these conserved dna elements are binding sites for the centromere binding proteins cbf1 cse4 mif2 and the cbf3 complex ndc10 ctf13 cep3 and skp1 that together make up the inner kinetochore reviewed in c heeseman et al 2002 the inner kinetochore associates with the central and outer kinetochore proteins to establish a link between the centromere of every chromosome and the mitotic spindle apparatus to ensure proper segregation during mitosis c heeseman et al 2002 early experiments designed to study centromeric dna showed that chromosomal insertion of a strong promoter adjacent to cen dna abrogated centromere function p anzeri et al 1984 this led to the construction of conditional centromeres by cloning strong regulatable promoters such as gal1 adjacent to cen sequences to allow controlled inactivation c hlebowicz -s ledziewska and s ledziewski 1985 h ill and b loom 1987 conditional centromeres have been used to alter the stability of plasmids yacs and whole chromosomes c hlebowicz -s ledziewska and s ledziewski 1985 h ill and b loom 1987 s mith et al 1990 in a plasmid context conditional centromeres can be used to amplify copy number since inactivating a cen sequence relieves copy number control causing plasmid number to increase in the mother cell at the same time inactivation of the cen sequence results in a higher frequency of plasmid loss which can be selected with a counter-selectable marker likewise when conditional centromeres are placed in a chromosomal context chromosome loss can be induced to generate 2 n x02212 1 diploids by counterselecting a marker on the conditional chromosome h ill and b loom 1987 we took advantage of the h ill and b loom 1987 observation to produce a set of 16 centromere-conditional counterselectable chromosomes in both mat a and mat x003b1 strains here we show that these strains produce chromosome specific 2 n x02212 1 monosomy and concomitant loss of heterozygosity loh we show that chromosome-specific loh can be used to map both recessive and dominant mutations using different readouts of the induced homozygous phenotype this procedure is useful to map any unknown gene to a specific chromosome which in turn accelerates the refinement of its genetic location finally we show that this same approach can be used to verify that the phenotype of a haploid deletion library strain is indeed due to the x0201c advertised x0201d gene disruption g418 was purchased from mediatech herndon va five 5 -fluoroorotic acid 5-foa was purchased from american bioanalytical natick ma taq dna polymerase was purchased from continental laboratory products san diego yeast extract x02013 peptone x02013 dextrose ypd medium synthetic complete sc medium synthetic dropout e.g sc x02212 trp media and 5-foa medium were prepared as described s herman et al 1986 except that 60 x003bc g/ml of leucine were added to synthetic plates where appropriate sporulation medium was prepared as in k lapholz and e sposito 1982 lithium acetate lioac transformations were performed as described s chiestl and g ietz 1989 a pcr product with the kluyveromyces lactis ura3 gene was cloned into the bgl ii and eco ri sites in puk21 v ieira and m essing 1991 to generate plasmid puk21-klura3 m3739 and a pcr product with the gal1 promoter was cloned into the bam hi and xba i sites in plasmid puc21 to generate plasmid puc21-gal m3738 a fse i x02013 eag i fragment from puc21-gal containing the gal1 promoter was then cloned into puk21-klura3 to generate puk21-klugal m3756 a sac i x02013 bss hii fragment from puk21-klura3 was then cloned into puc21-noti v oth et al 2001 to generate pklugal-noti m3828 containing the k. lactis ura3 gene and the pgal promoter flanked by multiple cloning site cassettes cen -proximal dna sequences x0201c left of cen x0201d and x0201c right of cen x0201d were pcr amplified from each yeast chromosome for cloning into plasmid pklugal-noti see supplemental table s1 for primer sequences the pcr primers used to amplify left of cen dna x0223c 800 x02013 1200 bp dna to the immediate left of each centromere added terminal sac i and sfi i restriction sites likewise pcr primers used to amplify right of cen dna x0223c 800 x02013 1200 bp to the right of the centromere added bss hii and bsi wi restriction sites the left and right dna fragments were then digested at the primer-encoded restriction sites for cloning into pklugal-noti to generate the pcen-ug plasmid for 15 of the yeast chromosomes figure 1a these plasmids each contain a specific centromere region interrupted by a k. lactis ura3 gene and the gal1 promoter figure 1a integrating dna fragments were liberated from the plasmids by not i digestion before transformation into strain w303-1a to replace the native centromere the cen -proximal insertion for chromosome 14 was not isolated after two attempts using the plasmid-based clone we therefore moved the gal1 promoter insertion to the other side of the chromosome 14 centromere using the pcr fusion method described below a conditional centromere for chromosome 14 was constructed by pcr amplification of dna to the left and right of the chromosome 14 centromere followed by pcr-based fusion to overlapping fragments of the k. lactis ura3-gal1 promoter cassette figure 1 b x02013 d amplification and pcr fusions were performed as described r eid et al 2002 in the first round of pcr a 418-bp left dna fragment that included cen14 was amplified using primer chr14newupr and adaptamer chr14newupf see supplemental table s1 for primer sequences a left fragment of the k. lactis ura3-gal1 cassette from pcen-ug was amplified using primer kl-galintf and adaptamer kl-galr a 567-bp fragment of chromosome 14 dna adjacent to and right of the centromere was amplified using primer chr14newdnf and adaptamer chr14newdnr a right fragment of the k. lactis ura3-gal1 cassette was amplified using primer kl-galintr and adaptamer kl-galf pcr products from the above reactions were fused in a second round of pcr using the complementary adaptamer tags to generate the illustrated products figure 1d transformation of the two pcr products into yeast and subsequent recombination generated a strain with a conditional centromere 14 figure 1d all strains containing conditional centromeres were verified by pcr amplification using primers flanking the region of homology paired with primers internal to the k. lactis ura3 coding region thus correct insertions could be monitored by amplification of a correct-sized dna molecule data not shown diploid strains containing a conditional centromere were made by crossing a cen -conditional strain to a test strain in patches incubating on ypd medium for 24 hr at 30 x000b0 then replica plating to the appropriate dropout medium to select for diploids these diploids were then replica plated to rich medium containing galactose as a carbon source ypgal and grown for 24 hr at 30 x000b0 to induce centromere destabilization finally the cen -destabilized strains were streaked onto medium containing 5-foa to select for cells that have lost the k. lactis ura3 gene and become 2 n x02212 1 camptothecin cpt sigma st louis was dissolved in dmso and added to synthetic media at a concentration of 5 x003bc g/ml with 0.25 dmso final concentration drug-free control plates also contained 0.25 dmso strains tested for cpt sensitivity in the verification experiments contained an additional wild-type top1 allele on a cen vector the copper-inducible promoter from the cup1 gene was obtained from plasmid ppw66r d ohmen et al 1994 after insertion of an mlu i linker to replace the dhfr-cdc28 fusion the pcup1 promoter was excised on a 440-bp bam hi x02013 mlu i fragment and cloned into those same sites in plasmid ycpsctop1 k auh and b jornsti 1995 the resulting pcup1-top1 fragment was then subcloned into plasmid prs415 s ikorski and h ieter 1989 to produce a leu2 -marked cen plasmid expressing top1 sixteen haploid yeast strains with conditional centromeres were made by integrating a gal1 promoter into each chromosome directly adjacent to consensus centromere sequences figure 1 and table 1 these conditional centromeres were constructed by cloning the gal1 promoter along with k. lactis ura3 between segments of cen -proximal dna followed by integration into the genome or by a pcr-based construction and integration as in figure 1 proper integration of the gal1 promoter and ura3 into each chromosome was assessed by pcr see materials and methods and the correct pcr fragment sizes were obtained for each modified cen sequence data not shown in addition each haploid strain grew normally on glucose medium but showed reduced viability on galactose medium indicating that gal1 promoter induction adjacent to a centromere is not tolerated in a haploid cell data not shown each strain bearing a conditional chromosome was tested for its ability to lose genetic markers on that chromosome upon galactose-induced promoter activation these experiments were performed in heterozygous diploids and chromosome loss was ascertained by loh in most of these experiments the cen- conditional strain was crossed to a test strain with one or more recessive auxotrophic markers covered by the corresponding wild-type alleles on the conditional chromosome chromosome loss and subsequent loh was monitored by loss of the wild-type allele and acquisition of the auxotrophic phenotype for example figure 2a shows a diagram of the relevant genetic markers on chromosome 14 after a cross of the cen14 -conditional strain w3617-1b to a tester strain k393-27c this diploid is heterozygous for the met4 and pet8 mutations on chromosome 14 and grows on sc x02212 methionine as well as ypg glycerol media figure 2b after induction of chromosome 14 loss loh 14 by growth on synthetic galactose medium followed by selection on 5-foa medium the loh 14 strain fails to grow on sc x02212 uracil sc x02212 methionine and ypg indicating the simultaneous loss of three different genetic markers the cen -linked ura3 marker the wild-type met4 and pet8 alleles in contrast this strain remained prototrophic for histidine and lysine showing no loh for heterozygous markers on chromosomes 6 and 9 each of the 16 cen -conditional strains was similarly tested for loh table 2 lists the strains used the markers tested for each cen -conditional chromosome and the loh phenotype observed upon chromosome loss multiple independent diploids were produced for each experiment and 20 or more single colonies were examined for loh for chromosomes 3 4 7 and 14 multiple markers were tested for loh events for these and all other chromosomes the appropriate marker loss was observed for each colony tested at the same time many heterozygous markers on chromosomes with unaltered centromeres were analyzed during these experiments and no loh events were observed for those markers there are multiple reports of haplo-insufficiency for specific yeast genes in a diploid background s tevens and d avis 1998 c hial et al 1999 d eutschbauer et al 2005 and there are also deleterious physiological effects of aneuploidy for 13 yeast chromosomes t orres et al 2007 we were therefore surprised to find that whole chromosome loh events were easily obtained for all sixteen chromosomes to further investigate these loh events we performed meiotic analysis for seven of the crosses listed in table 2 plus three additional crosses using w303-derived strains the cen -conditional strains used for meiotic analysis are listed in table 3 along with the tester strains that contained recessive auxotrophic marker s all 10 diploids were induced for chromosome loss sporulated and dissected the loh 1 and loh 6 strains each showed 2:2 spore viability all of the viable spores were uracil auxotrophs and the respective diploids also exhibited loh for markers on chromosomes 1 or 6 ade1 and his2 demonstrating that in both cases the chromosome containing the conditional centromere was lost in contrast loh events for the other seven chromosomes tested in table 3 showed a preponderance of four viable spores in these cases all spore products were uracil auxotrophs and showed 4:0 segregation for the marker listed in the loh column table 3 the mat locus showed 2:2 segregation as did any additional unlinked markers that were tested fourth column in table 3 thus it appears that for most whole chromosome loh events chromosome loss is followed by endoduplication of an entire chromosome we suspect that there is strong selective pressure for such an endoduplication event especially for the large chromosomes due to haplo-insufficiency s tevens and d avis 1998 c hial et al 1999 d eutschbauer et al 2005 in support of this notion we noted that during selection for loh strains on galactose and 5-foa media colonies were heterogeneous in size after additional passage these various-sized colonies grow more uniformly perhaps due to endoduplication however it is noteworthy that even after endoduplication these diploids maintain the loh which permits the mapping methods presented below the experiments described above demonstrate that conditional chromosomes efficiently induce loh after induction we used conditional loh induction to develop a method to rapidly map a recessive genetic marker to a specific chromosome for the first test of this method we used an unknown camptothecin-sensitive gene cpts in the his5 x00394 strain from the yeast gene disruption library w inzeler et al 1999 that we found during a screen for camptothecin sensitivity r. j. d. r eid and r. r othstein unpublished observations genetic analysis showed that the cpts gene is unlinked to his5 x00394 to map the unknown mutation a cpts his5 segregant was isolated and crossed to each of the 16 cen -conditional strains diploids were selected and induced for chromosome loss by growth on synthetic galactose medium followed by selection on 5-foa medium the loh strains were then grown serially diluted and spotted on synthetic medium with and without camptothecin as shown in figure 3 the cpts loh 2 strain shows a x0003e 10,000-fold growth reduction on camptothecin compared to the no-drug control a control cross of a wild-type strain to all of the cen -conditional strains using the same conditions for induction of chromosome loss resulted in no increased camptothecin sensitivity in any particular loh strain although the chromosome 2 heterozygous strain initially grows slowly on galactose it is the only one that becomes cpt sensitive when the conditional centromere-bearing chromosome is lost figure 3 thus the unknown camptothecin-sensitive phenotype in the mat x003b1 his5 x00394 x02237 kanmx deletion strain is due to a recessive gene on chromosome 2 next we tested candidate genes on chromosome 2 for complementation of the cpts drug sensitivity to choose the candidates we took advantage of the fact that the cpts gene showed very high cpt sensitivity but was not sensitive to gamma irradiation at 200 gy data not shown a gene on chromosome 2 mms4 has a similar phenotype when it is mutated x iao et al 1998 b astin -s hanower et al 2003 two other mutants that map on chromosome 2 the weakly cpt-sensitive atg14 x00394 x02237 kanmx mutant and a drug-resistant mutant ybr204c x00394 x02237 kanmx were also included in the complementation test figure 4 diploids from the cross of the cpts strain to atg14 and ybr204c are resistant to camptothecin and thus showed complementation however diploids from the cross of cpts to mms4 x00394 fail to complement as they show camptothecin sensitivity comparable to both the mms4 x00394 and the cpts haploid strains indicating that the unknown cpts gene on chromosome 2 is allelic to mms4 not every case of chromosome-scale mapping will provide potential candidate genes as in the example above as an alternative the unknown mutant can be crossed with all of the members of the haploid gene deletion set for a particular chromosome and then be tested for complementation this is feasible with a simple phenotypic assay such as drug sensitivity however even after systematic crosses the unknown gene may not exist in the haploid deletion library e.g essential genes and this approach may fail to identify the locus therefore another approach to localize the unknown gene is via traditional two-point crosses for example chromosome 2 is 813 kb with a physical-to-genetic distance ratio of 0.3 kb/cm c herry et al 1997 tetrad analysis can provide a reasonable measure of genetic distance up to 50 cm thus approximately eight equally spaced genetic markers on chromosome 2 could be used to map the genetic location of the unknown gene since the deletion library is marked with kanmx appropriately spaced deletion strains can be used directly for this mapping finally the genetic location can be ascertained systematically with multiple strains from the deletion library using the synthetic genetic array method j orgensen et al 2002 using this approach the mutant phenotype is screened after crosses with all of the markers on the chromosome of interest the use of x0201c magic x0201d markers ensures that after sporulation only haploid progeny grow permitting selection for the kanmx marker and subsequent screening for the mutant phenotype in this case the gene is localized when it fails to appear in the kanmx segregants that surround its map location the cen -conditional strains can also be used to map dominant alleles after loh induction in this case the loh event must be analyzed after meiosis for example a dominant allele on chromosome 2 that is crossed to the cen2 -conditional strain becomes homozygous after loh 2 since chromosome 2 like most chromosomes undergoes endoduplication sporulation and dissection of only the loh 2 strain produces 4:0 spores for the dominant phenotype in contrast among the remaining cen -conditional crosses note loh 3 does not sporulate the dominant allele on chromosome 2 remains heterozygous after loh for each chromosome and equal numbers of mutant and wild-type meiotic products are produced upon sporulation 2:2 the difference between 2:2 and 4:0 segregation can be easily determined by tetrad analysis in loh events where endoduplication does not occur such as loh 1 the same analysis is made except that tetrads of loh 1 strains are 2:2 for viability therefore among the live spore products an unlinked gene segregates 1:1 while a chromosome 1-linked gene segregates 2:0 to facilitate the mapping of a dominant gene a dissection-free protocol can be performed by random spore analysis in the following example we show how we confirmed the chromosome map position of a gene disruption from the yeast deletion library by scoring the kanmx dominant selectable marker the yor364w x02237 kanmx4 strain from the mat x003b1 library which contains a wild-type can1 gene was crossed to each of the cen -conditional chromosome strains which contain the can1-100 mutation the can1 gene is useful in this assay since can1 can1-100 diploids and can1 haploids are sensitive to canavanine and thus the only canavanine-resistant colonies that grow after sporulation are can1-100 haploids diploids were isolated and induced for chromosome loss the loh strains were sporulated and the asci were digested with glusulase to disrupt the tetrads and produce single spores s herman et al 1986 next the spores were diluted and plated so that x02264 300 colonies formed on synthetic medium containing canavanine the haploid colonies were replica plated to g418 medium and the number of g418-resistant colonies was counted and compared to the total number of canavanine-resistant colonies table 4 for this analysis chromosomes 3 and 5 can not be assayed since loh 3 events homozygose the mat locus and do not sporulate while the can1-100 allele is lost with the conditional chromosome 5 for 13 of the 14 remaining crosses x0223c 50 of the colonies in the random spore analysis are g418 resistant indicating random segregation of the kanmx -marked chromosome in contrast for the loh 15 strain all of the canavanine-resistant haploids are also g418 resistant indicating that the kanmx marker has become homozygous due to loh thus the yor364 x00394 x02237 kanmx allele is mapped to chromosome 15 confirming its chromosome position there are some limitations to mapping procedures using the cen -conditional strains described here for example any analyses that require sporulation such as mapping a dominant gene fail for chromosome 3 therefore we assign a gene to chromosome 3 by process of elimination however this limitation can be overcome by providing a plasmid-borne or nonchromosome 3 copy of the same mating-type locus in the cen3 -conditional strains thus when the native chromosome 3 is lost the additional mat locus provides mating-type function for sporulation another problem occurs during the random spore procedure for meiotic loh analysis the can1-100 allele is used to select haploid spore clones since loh 5 results in loss of that recessive drug-resistant mutation we are unable to select haploid strains during plating for chromosome 5 this limitation can be overcome by introducing lyp1 or cyh2 rpl28 mutations on chromosomes 14 or 7 into the chromosome 5 strain since these alleles cause recessive drug resistance to thiol-lysine g renson 1966 and cycloheximide k aufer et al 1983 respectively several methods have previously been developed to map a gene to a specific chromosome in some of these methods chromosome loss is randomly induced in certain genetic backgrounds for example by sporulation of a triploid strain as in w ickner 1979 behavior of the unknown gene is then compared to chromosome-specific markers to narrow the map position to a single chromosome another mapping method employs a spo11-1 mutation to suppress recombination during sporulation thus limiting the segregation of an unknown marker vs. chromosome-specific markers in predictable ways k lapholz and e sposito 1982 in these random chromosome loss and rec x02212 methods a mutation must first be crossed into appropriate strain backgrounds before mapping occurs in contrast no strain construction is required for our loh mapping procedure the unknown mutation need only be in a ura3 strain a mapping method that induces specific chromosome loss to allow analysis by loh was also developed on the basis of 2 x003bc -integration into all 16 yeast chromosomes in cir 0 strains w akem and s herman 1990 however in this method of chromosome loss loh events can routinely occur for only one chromosome arm depending on the site of 2 x003bc -integration r. r othstein and g. c hrebet unpublished observations thus many more than 16 strains are required for crosses to an unknown to cover the entire genome on the other hand the method of chromosome loss induction described here produces loh for all markers on a given chromosome and thus greatly simplifies the loh analysis compared to the 2 x003bc -integrations the methods described here rely on lack of complementation after an loh event to identify the chromosome containing a given recessive marker this principle can be used to validate a screen and verify that the gene responsible for a phenotype is likely linked to the corresponding gene disruption as an example we used the centromere-conditional strains described in this report to verify all of our x0201c hits x0201d in a recently completed screen of the yeast gene disruption library in that screen we expressed a top1 allele top1-t 722 a that acts as a cpt mimetic and damages dna m egonigal et al 1997 the full results of this screen will be described elsewhere r. j. d. r eid and r. r othstein unpublished results in brief the mutant top1 allele was expressed from the copper-inducible cup1 promoter on a cen plasmid that had been transferred into each strain in the deletion library heterologous expression of the mutant allele induces dna damage and most of the deletion mutants identified as sensitive to expression of the top1-t 722 a are also cpt sensitive approximately 140 strains showed increased sensitivity to expression of the top1-t 722 a mutant compared to wild type to assure that dna damage sensitivity was due to the specific kanmx -marked mutations we performed a secondary screen by crossing each of the 140 strains to the conditional centromere strain corresponding to the deletion allele 's chromosome these hybrid diploids also contain an additional wild-type copy of top1 on a plasmid which effectively increases the sensitivity of yeast strains to cpt r eid et al 1998 all 140 strains were retested for cpt sensitivity after loh induction and an example of the retest results from four different chromosome-8 mutants isolated in our screen are shown in figure 5 these four mutant strains were crossed to the cen8 -conditional strain and induced for loh 8 any spurious recessive factors residing on another chromosome that might result in dna damage sensitivity would be complemented in the loh 8 strain none of the heterozygous diploids including a wild-type control exhibits cpt sensitivity before loh we found that 3 of the 4 mutant strains are drug sensitive after loh 8 induction indicating that for those 3 strains the gene disruption on chromosome 8 was the likely cause of drug sensitivity on the other hand the dia4 mutant showed no cpt sensitivity in loh 8 diploids and thus we could eliminate further study of this strain approximately 70 of the mutants isolated in the top1-t 722 a mutant screen validated after rescreening by loh spurious secondary mutations unlinked to the kanmx insertions have been identified in the deletion library l ehner et al 2007 and we showed one such example above cpts mms4 in principle such a mutation can occur on the same chromosome as a library gene disruption and would not be identified as a false positive using the method described here a hypothetical worst case occurs when verifying chromosome-4 deletion strains but even though chromosome 4 contains x0223c 13 of the total coding dna in yeast our loh rescreen would remove 87 of the cases of secondary mutants assuming that these would be distributed randomly on all chromosomes we assume that the contribution of spurious secondary mutations in these screens is relatively small so removing x0223c 90 of such events is quite good we have produced a set of 16 centromere-conditional chromosomes that can be used to induce loh the systematic loh induction described here provides a simple and effective means of mapping both recessive and dominant alleles to specific chromosomes in addition hybrid diploid formation and loh can be used to complement spurious genetic variation in strains isolated in library screens our simple rescreening procedure effectively eradicates such variation and confirms the results from any library screen we thank peter thorpe and david alvaro for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript this work was funded in part by national institutes
