Common perception was that it was a place where the streets rolled up after 5 p.m. Now there’s a vibrant nightlife and entertainment corridor along Michigan Avenue, several new restaurants, craft breweries and distilleries have sprung to life, and we’re utilizing the riverfront more with great developments planned for 2019. Lansing is, in a word, cool. It’s cool to be from Lansing, it’s cool to be in Lansing and it’s cool to take part in what Lansing has to offer. I believe there are many factors that have come together to foster the regional renaissance we are experiencing. We start with a welcoming, safe and diverse community located within 90 miles of 90 percent of Michigan’s population. We have community leaders who are committed to advancing the region through redevelopment combined with a shared vision and collaboration among elected officials, the business community, regional organizations and developers. An emerging base of upwardly mobile young people moving into the urban core is creating a tipping point for accelerated redevelopment. This renaissance is visible to our visitors, which builds future visitor demand. The Lansing area has long been a popular destination for events and statewide conventions due to our size, central location, value, and access to state lawmakers and Michigan State University. While the group segment has continued to grow in the last decade, we have seen an explosion in youth amateur sports competitions for our region. The convention attendees and the families that come to our region for sports competitions are seeing and experiencing a more desirable destination and are returning as leisure visitors to enjoy the assets of our community. Many of these convention/sports visitors are experiencing the new Lansing region for the first time in many years. According to visitor research conducted by the Northstar Group, among visitors who changed their perception of the Lansing region after visiting, 95 percent were more positive. The community is seen as vibrant, friendly, helpful and accommodating. Visitors see and experience firsthand the redevelopment and are pleasantly surprised by the variety of restaurants, fun nightlife, unique shops and things to explore. The Greater Lansing region welcomes over 4.8 million visitors per year. We anticipate that number will likely surpass 5 million visitors in the very near future. Economic impact data shows tourism generated $424 million in direct spending in 2008. According to the Anderson Economic Group, tourism currently generates over $600 million in direct spending annually to the Greater Lansing region. Lansing has come so far in such a short time, and we are poised to continue this momentum well into the future with a wide range of exciting and attractive development projects. Among the highlights in Greater Lansing are: Today’s visitors are looking for more unique, authentic and experience-oriented activities. There is more interest in experiencing destinations “like a local.” Visitors want their destination information delivered digitally and seek out unique, personalized and customized experiences and amenities. They expect to find great dining with restaurants serving locally sourced ingredients and access to global cuisine. They expect to find great craft beverages. They want fun transportation options. Lansing provides all the above, with plenty more on the way. A city with cranes in the air and active development underway says to a visitor that this is a place with vision, innovation and upward movement. Lansing is on the rise.
