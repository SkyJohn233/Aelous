Yo  @ Panthers  we really need Brian Schottenheimer. I’d ask Santa but he isn’t real.  # nomoremediocre I think the  @ NFL  treats it’s players unfairly. Mama always said it takes 2 to fight.

But then  @ KeithUrban  took the stage. Wow!!  # CMAawards2019 Just sayin...  @ OldDominion  best performance of the night so far  # CMAs2019 Happy Veterans Day to our nation’s finest!

R. Martin Caught up in selfishness rooted in pride. My only escape is God’s grace! “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me. 2 Corinthians 12:8-9 This lil yellow lab pup needs a home.
