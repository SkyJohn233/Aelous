combinations of anti-lfa-1 everolimus anti-cd40 ligand and allogeneic bone marrow induce central transplantation tolerance through hemopoietic chimerism including protection from chronic heart allograft rejection the journal of immunology advanced search central transplantation tolerance through hemopoietic chimerism initially requires inhibition of allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow bm rejection as previously achieved in murine models by combinations of t cell costimulation blockade we have evaluated lfa-1 blockade as part of regimens to support mixed hemopoietic chimerism development upon fully allogeneic balb/c bm transfer to nonirradiated busulfan-treated b6 recipient mice combining anti-lfa-1 with anti-cd40 ligand cd40l induced high incidences and levels of stable multilineage hemopoietic chimerism comparable to chimerism achieved with anti-cd40l and everolimus 40- o 2-hydroxyethyl -rapamycin under conditions where neither ab alone was effective the combination of anti-lfa-1 with everolimus also resulted in high levels of chimerism albeit with a lower incidence of stability inhibition of acute allograft rejection critically depended on chimerism stability even if maintained at very low levels around 1 as was the case for some recipients without busulfan conditioning chimerism stability correlated with a significant donor bm-dependent loss of host-derived vβ11 t cells 3 mo after bm transplantation tx combinations of anti-cd40l with anti-lfa-1 or everolimus also prevented acute rejection of skin allografts transplanted before established chimerism albeit not independently of allospecific bmtx all skin and heart allografts transplanted to stable chimeras 3 and 5 mo after bmtx respectively were protected from acute rejection moreover this included prevention of heart allograft vascular intimal thickening chronic rejection bone marrow bm 2 or hemopoietic stem cell transplantation tx often constitutes part of a therapy for human hemopoietic deficiencies and malignancies 1 2 notwithstanding its proven clinical potential for subsequent allograft tolerance 3 toxicity of conditioning regimens and complications arising from alloreactivity have thus far precluded the clinical use of bmtx for tolerance induction 4 studies in animal models therefore have aimed to minimize conditioning and to optimize immune modulation for allogeneic bmtx 5 these have included alloantigen-specific immune modulation instead of general host t cell depletion and replacement of myeloablative irradiation treatments with milder cytoreduction 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 several studies in rodent models have focused on costimulation blockade by synergistic targeting of b7-cd28 and cd40-cd40 ligand cd40l interactions 10 11 12 13 while these ligand/receptor systems proved essential for most immune responses other costimulatory molecules also contribute substantially to productive immunity and hence their blockade may promote bm allograft survival and chimerism development the β 2 integrin lfa-1 is involved in t cell costimulation and migration 14 15 in addition to targeting its dual contribution to t cell immunity blocking lfa-1 may also benefit allogeneic bm engraftment through inhibition of nk cell activation 16 17 18 19 moreover clinical reports demonstrated a favorable impact of anti-lfa-1-blocking abs or defective lfa-1 expression on hemopoietic chimerism in bmtx patients 20 21 22 in this report we show that combinations of anti-lfa-1 with anti-cd40l or the rapamycin derivative everolimus 40- o 2-hydroxyethyl -rapamycin 23 induce stable mixed hemopoietic chimerism upon transfer of a single standard dose of allogeneic bm cells 2 × 10 7 and irradiation-free conditioning with the alkylating agent busulfan for partial depletion of early hemopoietic stem cells 13 24 while combined treatment with anti- lfa-1 and anti-cd40l resulted in high incidences of stable chimerism with comparable efficacy to anti-cd40l and everolimus about one-half of the bm recipients treated with anti-lfa-1 and everolimus eventually lost chimerism chimerism stability correlated with allospecific bm-dependent host vβ11 t cell

deletion under the influence of donor bm respectively in chimeric bm recipients host-type gated h-2d d -negative vβ11 t cells declined over time from 5– 6 to 1–2 while vβ8 t cells showed a small

chimerism levels and vβ8 vβ11 ratios a comparison between stable and unstable chimerism revealed a clear correlation between a significant increase of the vβ8 vβ11 ratio resulting from a reduction of

increased above basal levels at this time and chimerism was lost 8 mo after bmtx these data suggest therefore that the degree of vβ11 depletion 3 mo after bmtx may be more predictive for subsequent chimerism stability than chimerism levels per se inhibition of skin allograft rejection is a routine readout for transplantation tolerance in mice for the present study the same animals shown in fig 3 ⇑ a were used to test the role of hemopoietic chimerism and chimerism stability in this system fig 3 ⇑ b skin tx was performed 3 mo after bmtx bm recipients that failed to develop chimerism lost both balb/c and third-party c3h skin grafts through early acute rejection around days 7–11 one anti-lfa-1 plus everolimus-treated bm recipient that had lost chimerism by the time of skin tx rejected skin grafts as early as recipients that had never displayed detectable chimerism fig 3 ⇑ a and bb open triangles when chimerism was significant at the time of skin tx and subsequently lost over a longer period of time this delayed but did not prevent acute skin graft rejection fig 3 ⇑ ab and bb open squares the delay of acute rejection to day 16 specifically correlated with previous transient chimerism because the same animal acutely rejected its third-party c3h skin graft by day 9 another bm recipient of early declining but subsequently low level stable chimerism never showed any signs of acute rejection of the balb/c skin graft whereas third-party c3h skin was acutely rejected by day 9 fig 3 ⇑ ab and bb open circles together these data suggest that the stability of chimerism is critical for allograft tolerance in this model regardless of the combination treatment used to achieve chimerism and without apparent correlations between tolerance and chimerism levels although stable hemopoietic chimeras never lost balb/c skin grafts through acute rejection most grafts eventually changed through a slow process of increasing dryness and hair loss in the absence of overall inflammation and necrosis similar to previously reported chronic rejection through skin-specific ags 29 30 31 32 these changes were specific for balb/c skin grafts because syngeneic b6 skin grafts cotransplanted with balb/c skin onto some chimeric recipients remained completely intact until the end of the experiment allograft tolerance through hemopoietic chimerism was shown to be reflected by loss of in vitro alloreactivity in mlr assays 32 lack of mlr activity was confirmed with spleens from chimeric skin graft recipients fig 4 ⇓ as expected positive mlr was detected with spleens from bm recipients that failed to develop chimerism the strength of this mlr was comparable for responder spleens from naive b6 mice fig 4 ⇓ more vigorous in vitro alloreactivity however was consistently obtained with responder spleens from bm recipients that had slowly lost previously significant levels of chimerism fig 4 ⇓ different mlr kinetics were excluded from this interpretation as spleen cells from all animals responded with the same kinetics to irradiated balb/c target cells fig 4 ⇓ inset enhanced in vitro alloreactivity by bm recipients with slow loss of chimerism argues against loss of chimerism as an immunologically neutral event and presumably reflects previous in vivo alloreactivity against donor-type hemopoietic cells one-way mlr responder spleen cell suspensions were prepared 250 days after bmtx from recipients that had received different combination treatments and displayed distinct patterns of chimerism development as indicated underneath the bar graphs each bar

as described in materials and methods the stimulation index is the ratio of signals obtained with b6 splenocytes and irradiated balb/c cells to signals from b6 splenocytes and irradiated b6 cells inset differences in mlr activity are not due to different kinetics data from the same individual mice presented as bar graphs for day 6 are shown as individual line graphs for days 3 4 5 and 6 combination treatments of anti-cd40l plus anti-lfa-1 and anti-cd40l plus everolimus appeared to be equally effective for hemopoietic chimerism development and skin allograft tolerance with tighter timing of bmtx and skin tx however strategies of immune modulation would have to prevent both donor-specific bm and skin graft rejection before the establishment of central tolerance such a protocol would be closer to some clinical situations of concurrent cadaveric bm and organ grafting and it might reveal different efficacies between combination treatments as well as a potential for bm-independent allograft protection to address these issues mice received bm and skin grafts within 2 days while applying the same short-term treatment regimens of anti-cd40l with anti-lfa-1 or everolimus as outlined in fig 1 ⇑ b three months later all mice received secondary balb/c and third-party c3h skin grafts allogeneic bmtx resulted in stable chimerism and specific inhibition of acute skin allograft rejection in all recipients and with both combinations tables i ⇓ and ii ⇓ group 1 for syngeneic bmtx controls both combination treatments delayed but did not prevent acute rejection of primary skin grafts tables i ⇓ and ii ⇓ group 2 this delay was longer with anti-lfa-1 plus anti-cd40l median day 36 than with anti-cd40l plus everolimus median day 17 and it was comparable for both balb/c and c3h skin grafts within each group as it was for the first c3h skin grafts on balb/c bm recipients thus demonstrating strict allospecific bm-dependent skin graft tolerance furthermore all anti-lfa-1 plus anti-cd40l and anti-cd40l plus everolimus-treated recipients of syngeneic bm acutely rejected secondary balb/c and c3h skin grafts with fast kinetics comparable to control ab-treated recipients tables i ⇓ and ii ⇓ group 3 thereby revealing lack of allospecific bm-independent peripheral tolerance skin allograft tolerance with anti-cd40l and anti-lfa-1 treatment depends on allospecific bmtx a skin allograft tolerance with anti-cd40l and everolimus depends on allospecific bmtx a with near-concomitant tx of allomatched bm and skin far more skin allografts remained fully intact without undergoing chronic changes a phenomenon observed in earlier reports on concurrent transfer of hemopoietic cells and skin tx 31 the integrity of secondary balb/c skin grafts in chimeric mice appeared to be linked to primary skin graft survival since none of the animals that retained perfect primary balb/c skin grafts until the end of the experiment day 270 or 275 after bmtx displayed signs of chronic rejection of their secondary skin grafts either a particular onset of chronic primary graft deterioration usually correlated with earlier signs of chronic rejection in secondary grafts in three cases secondary balb/c skin grafts deteriorated with rapidly progressing inflammation that was more reminiscent of acute rather than chronic rejection two animals in group 1 table i ⇑ one animal in group 1 table ii ⇑ these findings suggested memory responses to bm-independent skin ag s because stable multilineage chimerism was maintained in all cases our previous results were consistent with a mechanism of transplantation tolerance that was strictly dependent on central t cell tolerance through stable hemopoietic chimerism by contrast transient chimerism in nonhuman primates was sometimes sufficient to support long-term renal allograft survival 33 it was proposed for these cases that the organ graft itself might be involved in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance another suggested mechanism was the induction of b cell tolerance by bmtx thereby avoiding alloantibody-related complications the latter possibility was supported by a report showing that chances for renal allograft survival in the context of bmtx were greatly increased by splenectomy other monkeys developed igg alloantibodies after kidney tx and rejected their grafts after the loss of chimerism 34 in murine systems chimerism-induced tolerance has been more extensively studied for cellular than for humoral immunity for our system we asked how alloantibodies might be related to the failure of stable chimerism and skin graft rejection b6 recipients of balb/c bm were treated with anti-lfa-1 plus everolimus with or without balb/c skin tx 2 days after bmtx igm and igg alloantibodies were detected by flow cytometry of balb/c pbl t cells stained with b6 plasma prepared 8–9 mo after bmtx table iii ⇓ complete failure of chimerism in a control group treated with everolimus alone did not result in alloantibody production table iii ⇓ group 2 among nine anti-lfa-1 plus everolimus-treated recipients of balb/c bmtx with stable chimerism no skin tx eight mice did not develop igm or igg alloantibodies and only one recipient was positive for allogeneic bm but not igg table iii ⇓ group 3 one animal from this group displayed the characteristic pattern of declining multilineage chimerism that was lost by 3 mo after bmtx alloreactive igm or igg was not detected however suggesting that loss of chimerism in this model was not accompanied by alloantibody formation table iii ⇓ group 3 remarkably still no alloantibodies were detectable when an anti-lfa-1 plus everolimus-treated recipient of both balb/c bm and skin slowly lost its chimerism over 3 mo and also lost its skin graft through delayed acute rejection 46 days after tx table iii ⇓ group 4 this lack of alloantibodies appeared to depend on previously detected chimerism because one animal from the same treatment group that completely failed to develop chimerism and acutely rejected its skin graft with a moderate delay on day 18 clearly contained allospecific igg group 4 mean fluorescence intensity 80.7 compared with 23.8 in negative controls group 1 we further confirmed that lack of alloantibody formation correlated with transient mixed chimerism and was not achieved by anti-lfa-1 plus everolimus alone because all anti-lfa-1 plus everolimus-treated recipients of syngeneic b6 bm and balb/c skin acutely rejected their skin grafts with the same moderate delay median day 17 table iii ⇓ group 5 yet displayed high levels of igg mean fluorescence intensity 169 table iii ⇓ group 5 nevertheless immune modulation by anti-lfa-1 plus everolimus alone also appeared to slightly reduce alloantibody

outlier 125 vs 12 p 0.029 taken together these data demonstrate a dominant role of chimerism for the inhibition of alloantibodies in contrast to cellular immunity and transplantation tolerance transient chimerism appears to be sufficient for the prevention of alloantibodies in this model and this persists even in the light of delayed acute skin graft rejection lack of alloantibodies after transient chimerism with anti-lfa-1 plus everolimus treatment a we next tested to what extent chimerism-induced tx tolerance could protect heart allografts as a clinically relevant solid organ although only ∼5 of all skin allografts transplanted 3 mo after bmtx were also protected from chronic rejection early studies by steinmuller and lofgreen 35 suggested that heart allografts may not pose the same problems of tissue-specific ags as observed for skin grafts while our experiments were ongoing one study reported protection from acute but not from chronic heart graft rejection by established chimeras 36 whereas in another system both acute and chronic heart allograft rejection were prevented by bmtx albeit with a protocol that included costimulation blockade beyond chimerism induction at the time of heart tx 37 in the present study heart allografts were transplanted 5 mo after bmtx thus depending on established chimerism alone in the absence of peripheral immune modulation the pretreatment regimen of some groups in early experiments included the lyophospholipid drug fty720 which prevents allograft rejection by blocking lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs 38 as reported for other models and combination treatments however 39 40 fty720 neither interfered nor synergized with combinations of anti-cd40l anti-lfa-1 and everolimus for chimerism induction table iv ⇓ group 4 and data not shown those early bm recipients with fty720 as part of their treatment regimen daily from days −3 to day 0 with respect to bmtx were included to increase overall

dose or completely omitted busulfan three of nine mice without busulfan conditioning developed low levels of multilineage chimerism one recipient with low levels of chimerism that was lost by 2 mo

hematopoietic chimerism prevents acute skin allograft rejection and heart allograft rejection including protection from vascular intimal thickening chronic rejection a taken together these data demonstrate that stable hemopoietic chimerism alone even at very low levels induced by previous short-term combination treatments of anti-lfa-1 plus anti-cd40l or anti-cd40l plus everolimus protects heart allografts from acute rejection as well as vascular intimal thickening in the present study we describe novel combinations of anti-lfa-1 with anti-cd40l and everolimus that support the development of stable mixed hemopoietic chimerism and transplantation tolerance after fully allogeneic bmtx combining inhibition of lfa-1 through abs or a knockout phenotype along with ctla-4ig was shown to prolong heart skin or islet allografts and lfa-1 blockade improved protection of skin and heart allografts in cd40l-deficient recipients or in synergy with anti-cd40l 41 42 43 44 to our knowledge synergism between anti-lfa-1 and everolimus or sirolimus/rapamycin has not been reported previously to support either solid tissue or bm graft survival while anti-cd40l combined with anti-lfa-1 induced high incidences of stable chimerism the combination of anti-lfa 1 with everolimus resulted in unstable chimerism in ∼50 of bm recipients this was unlikely to be a consequence of insufficient lfa-1 blockade because higher doses of anti-lfa-1 did notincrease the incidence of chimerism stability data not shown enhanced in vitro alloreactivity by responder splenocytes from recipients with unstable chimerism was consistent with host rejection of donor hemopoietic cells rather than passive loss of engraftment in contrast to increased cellular alloreactivity however slow loss of chimerism did not induce alloantibody production indicating differential regulation of t and b cell alloimmunity by bmtx in this system bm recipients without any detectable chimerism did not develop alloantibodies unless challenged with a skin allograft suggesting that in this situation b cells were neither activated nor tolerized by allogeneic bm alone recipients with stable mixed chimerism contained no alloantibodies with or without skin allografts formally this might have been accounted for by indirect inhibitory effects on b cells through t cell tolerance surprisingly unstable chimerism after anti lfa-1 plus everolimus treatment did not trigger alloantibody production even after acute skin allograft rejection together these observations suggest that in this system 1 loss of chimerism resulted from cellular alloreactivity alone 2 lack of alloantibodies after transient and probably also stable chimerism reflected direct b cell tolerance 3 humoral effector mechanisms were not required for acute skin allograft rejection 4 b cell tolerance through transient chimerism was not broken by acute skin allograft rejection and 5 t and b cell compartments have different requirements for tolerance induction after bmtx and direct b cell tolerance is possible in the absence of t cell tolerance t cell-independent intrinsic b cell tolerance was previously described for a mouse model of semiallogeneic bmtx in this study b cell tolerance required the presence of semiallogeneic hemopoietic cells as it was observed in mixed but not in full bone marrow chimeras 45 although our data suggest persisting b cell tolerance after loss of chimerism this does not argue against the requirement for the continuous supply of a hemopoietic source of alloantigen which may be present below the detection limit of flow cytometry and/or in distinct locations such as the bone marrow in contrast to our mouse model alloantibodies may occur after loss of chimerism and contribute to solid organ allograft rejection in nonhuman primate models that are closer to the clinical setting 34 it will be important to investigate further the role of humoral alloreactivity in the context of bmtx the requirements for b cell tolerance and to identify regimens that induce and maintain this process interestingly the combination treatment of anti-lfa-1 plus everolimus alone without allogeneic bm reduced alloantibody levels after acute skin allograft rejection it was not clear however whether this was secondary to transiently reduced cellular immunity as indicated by a delay in skin graft rejection or the consequence of a direct effect on b cells notwithstanding the suboptimal average rate of ∼50 incidence of stable chimerism after treatment with anti-lfa-1 plus everolimus the data show that in principle this combination can provide sufficient immune modulation to protect fully allomismatched hemopoietic cells albeit with a lower probability although costimulation through lfa-1 was shown to contribute to il-2 production cell cycle progression and effector functions of both cd8 and cd4 t cells 46 47 48 49 cd8 t cells appeared to be more sensitive to lfa-1-mediated costimulation 50 51 a recent study using allogeneic hepatocyte transfer in cd4- and cd8-deficient mice demonstrated the relevance of both cd40l and lfa-1 costimulation pathways for both alloreactive cd4 and cd8 t cells albeit with a stronger influence of lfa-1 than cd40l on costimulation for cd4-independent cd8-dependent alloreactivity 52 in the context of hemopoietic chimerism selective cd4 and cd8 depletion experiments revealed that anti-cd40l could overcome cd4 but not cd8 t cell-dependent resistance to allogeneic bm engraftment 53 everolimus like rapamycin/sirolimus interferes with advanced stages of t cell activation by inhibiting growth factor responsiveness 54 although this might be expected to inhibit both cd4 and cd8 t cells rapamycin appeared to affect cd8 t cell alloreactivity and proliferation more strongly 55 56 taken together it is conceivable that the combinations of anti-cd40l plus anti-lfa-1 and anti-cd40l plus everolimus provide sufficient blockade of both cd4- and cd8-dependent alloreactivity whereas the combination of anti-lfa-1 plus everolimus may be suboptimal for blocking cd4 t cells ongoing experiments address the effect of different combinations on cd4 and cd8 t cell alloreactivity rapamycin/sirolimus was recently shown to induce hemopoietic chimerism in combination with anti-cd40l albeit in the context of more permissive protocols that also supported chimerism with rapamycin or anti-cd40l alone 57 or with cd40l blockade alone 58 by contrast under the relatively stringent conditions used in our studies no irradiation no donor-specific transfusion single busulfan treatment and single bm cell transfer the combination of anti-cd40l and everolimus was strictly synergistic as neither reagent alone supported chimerism upon bmtx this contrasts with reports on bmtx-induced chimerism under cd40l blockade alone presumably owing to stronger cytoreduction or repeated bm infusion with more frequent administration of anti-cd40l 12 56 57 several mechanisms of action were proposed for anti-cd40l as a single agent or in combination with ctla-4ig or rapamycin including the induction of t regulator cells 58 59 fc-and complement-dependent deletion 60 61 and apoptosis through costimulation blockade 10 62 63 in our experiments short-term treatment with anti-cd40l combined with either anti-lfa-1 or everolimus did not prevent acute skin allograft rejection in the absence of allomatched bmtx nor was acute rejection of secondary skin grafts delayed thus demonstrating a lack of peripheral allogeneic bm-independent mechanisms of tolerance despite the relatively short-lived protection in the absence of allospecific bmtx balb/c skin grafts transplanted 2 daysafter balb/c bmtx were well protected with either anti-cd40l-containing combination treatment since central deletion of allospecific thymocytes during this early period after bmtx was unlikely to be sufficient for allograft tolerance it is possible that allogeneic bm-dependent peripheral deletion of donor-reactive t cells as reported previously 10 could have contributed to skin allograft protection compared with pretransplant vβ11 data and those measured for recipients of syngeneic bm we observed a moderate reduction of vβ11 tcr t cells from 5–6 to 4–5 in anti-cd40l plus anti-lfa-1 and anti-cd40l plus everolimus-treated recipients 2 wk after allogeneic bmtx in these experiments data not shown when skin tx was performed 3 mo after bmtx and in the absence of peripheral immune modulation however the clear correlation between substantial host-type vβ11 t cell depletion and chimerism stability and between chimerism stability and transplantation tolerance strongly suggested that thymus-independent mechanisms of tolerance if they existed under these conditions were not sufficient to prevent acute allograft rejection a recent study demonstrated a correlation among t cell chimerism host vβ11 t cell depletion and skin graft tolerance 65 our data also strongly implied yet could not systematically show a critical role for t cell chimerism because we rarely observed selective loss of t cell chimerism while developing or preserving chimerism among other hemopoietic lineages in all our experiments nonmyeloablative cytoreduction before bmtx was achieved with busulfan initially at a dose of 30 mg/kg previously shown to support high levels of chimerism 13 even the highest busulfan dose did not support chimerism in the absence of potent costimulation blockade however indicating that busulfan was ineffective as an immunosuppressive agent in this system as it was in previous murine studies 13 this may differ for haploidentical settings as shown in a dog model where an incidence of 50 chimerism with busulfan treatment alone was reported for mhc-compatible bm donors 66 however as also reported in this study attempts to induce chimerism with mhc-mismatched host-donor combination failed with busulfan alone suggesting a minor role of busulfan as an immunosuppressive agent compared with its more dominant cytoreductive function because of series side effects in humans the clinical use of busulfan for bm or stem cell tx and cancer treatment is usually limited to 16 mg/kg or less given through multiple applications over several days 67 68 therefore ideally novel immune modulatory regimens should be effective when combined with milder cytoreduction in our murine system effective immune modulation after reduced busulfan dosing 15 mg/kg induced high incidences of lower overall levels of hemopoietic chimerism yet without compromising transplantation tolerance moreover it was possible to achieve low incidences of stable multilineage chimerism with potent immune modulation when busulfan was omitted completely presumably strong inhibition of host- anti-donor bm alloreactivity permits some donor stem cells to settle within host bm niches during physiological stem cell migration in the absence of drug- or irradiation-induced homeostasis perturbance 69 a competitive advantage of allogeneic bm stem cells with ensuing mixed chimerism in the absence of cytoreductive conditioning was also achieved with costimulation blockade and multiple standard doses 2 × 10 7 or a single high dose 2 × 10 8 of allogeneic bm cells 11 12 although stable hemopoietic chimerism even at low levels prevented acute skin graft rejection most recipients nevertheless displayed signs of chronic skin graft deterioration of variable and usually late onset and in the light of fully preserved hemopoietic chimerism as described previously for immunity against bm-independent skin-specific ags 29 30 31 32 70 heart allograft integrity however was never compromised in chimeric recipients with chronic skin graft rejection suggesting lack of cross-reactivity between skin and heart ags similar conclusions were drawn from earlier studies that compared heart and skin graft survival in radiation chimeras although histological screening for heart arteriopathy was not reported 35 although a short 2-day interval between bmtx and skin tx substantially delayed or prevented chronic rejection it did not achieve complete protection this contrasts with studies by adams et al 13 who demonstrated indefinite skin allograft survival for the same balb/c-b6 donor-recipient combination when bmtx and skin tx were performed on the same day under costimulation blockade with anti-cd40l and ctla-4ig administered until day 28 conceivably costimulation blockade over a longer period and/or with still closer timing of bmtx and skin tx improved the incidence of complete skin allograft protection alternatively or in addition ctla-4ig might have increased the probability of indefinite skin graft survival possibly by superior costimulation blockade and/or by promoting apoptosis of skin ag-specific t cells through b7-induced modulation of apc tryptophan metabolism 71 in our experiments stable hemopoietic chimerism even at very low levels was sufficient to prevent both acute and chronic heart graft rejection as previously reported for a rat model of mixed chimerism 72 costimulation blockade and allogeneic bm-mediated protection from chronic heart graft rejection in mice was recently reported by shiragusi et al 37 in their study bmtx and heart tx were performed on the same day with both grafts being under the effect of costimulation blockade with anti-cd40l and ctla-4ig until 3 mo after tx it was possible therefore that in this case heart allografts benefited from concurrent bmtx with extended costimulation blockade in contrast in another mouse model russell et al 36 observed chronic rejection of heart grafts transplanted to established chimeras rather than at the time of bmtx this was suggested as a possible reason to account for the discrepancies between both earlier studies as was the use of ctla-4ig and anti-cd40l during the peritransplant period in one but not the other regimen neither of these explanations readily account for the lack of chronic rejection in our experiments however since stable mixed hemopoietic chimerism through bmtx under short-term combination treatments of anti-cd40l and anti-lfa-1 or everolimus was sufficient to fully preserve heart allografts transplanted ∼5 mo after bmtx possibly variable success of complete allograft protection in hemopoietic chimeras may be related to initial conditioning regimens and/or immune modulation as well as different shades of tissue-specific ag immunogenicity between different donor-recipient strain combinations for a clinically relevant approach it will now be necessary to further understand the requirements for immune modulation that support chimerism stability and to
