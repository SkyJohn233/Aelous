Research data were analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficient and stepwise regression. The results of stepwise regression analysis showed that from among of the nine scales of cognitive emotion regulation strategies scale, catastrophizing, acceptance, refocusing on planning, rumination, and recent stress, respectively, influence and significantly predict depression (P < 0.001).
