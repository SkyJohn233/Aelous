Bamana and Bozo Songs from Kirango, Mali by Elisabeth den Otter Kirango, in the arrondissement Markala,  is a village with over six thousand inhabitants, located on the  bank of the Niger river about 40 kilometres north east of the  city of S gou. During the masquerades of the Bamana and  Bozo of Kirango, large puppets in the shape of mythical animals  (sogow, liter-ally 'meat') are made to dance by puppeteers that  are hidden inside. Some of the animals carry small rod puppets  on their back (maanin, literally 'little people'), which 'dance'  as well. They alternate with masked dan-cers, equally representing  mythical animals and symbolic persons. These hidden dancers express  the character repre-sented by the puppet or mask, through their  move-ments. The male bush buffalo, Sigi, symbolises  strength and the power of tradition. On his back, he carries  small rod puppets representing women pounding millet, a farmer,  fisherman in a boat, the water-god Faro, and a crocodile. He  is accompanied by men playing drums. Other occasions during which music and  song may be heard, are weddings and traditional hunter's feasts  of the Bamana, who are famous for their hunting skills.
