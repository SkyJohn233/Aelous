S01E09 - Fucksgiving : orangeisthenewblack Whoa, how about Susan &# x27;s  " Crazy Eye &# x27;s "  parents?! "  I can &# x27;t wait to see her back story, that was quite interesting. Fuck Sam Healey. Yeah seriously the way his character turned after Chapman still got the track opened was not expected. FUCK_THAT_GUY. I think that &# x27;s the problem. So Maury Kind = Ira Glass, right? Mendez always has been a certain level of asshole though, but Healy almost matched him for assholery this episode. I mean when  Pornstache  thinks you &# x27;ve gone too far... you &# x27;ve gone fucking too far. I must have missed something why is Healy so mad at chapman? He &# x27;s been a little peeved at her since WAC Attack, but what made him really mad was being told she was having sex with Alex. He thought she was going to be a good little girl who toed the line, did what he told her and took her medicine without complaint. Turns out, she &# x27;s got a mind of her own, dares to dislike him and worst of all, is a lesbian.  He &# x27;s a misogynist and a homophobe. Since when can inmates have shoelaces? Especially in solitary confinement.. Little real world details aren &# x27;t really this director &# x27;s strong suit or what this series is really trying to do. This ain &# x27;t Oz. On another note I just finished this episode and know that I only have four left.  > _ <  I &# x27;m not ready for it to end but know that I can &# x27;t pace myself either. I. HAVE. TO. WATCH. Why is cheating so justified? Seriously shits fucked up yo I loved the ending of the show, they really nailed the final season so I &# x27;ve decided to rewatch it all (I &# x27;ve rewatched pretty much every year in between seasons but there &# x27;s none left so this will be the first time knowing how it all ends). This post will have spoilers so don &# x27;t read if you haven &# x27;t finished the show yet. First I want to say how sad it is to see taystee so happy. Pretty much since the end of season five her entire story was depressingly dark and she was consistently pushed down so to see her jumping around, laughing singing etc it makes it very sad knowing what &# x27;s coming. I think the scenes with piper before she goes to prison also have a little bit more power for me now. When she and Larry have sex the night before she cries during it and again knowing everything to come makes you realise they never really had a shot. This was her last night as this version of piper. Reds hair is really red in the pilot and not orange as it is through most of the show which is pretty funny. Also the prison somehow feels emptied especially the cafeteria though that &# x27;s probably just cause it &# x27;s the pilot. Nichols is my favourite character but God she comes off as predatory in the first episode haha. The use of flashbacks in the series is great and the pilot is no exception. Seeing piper and her life with Larry and her friends as she &# x27;s making soap and living this perfect middle class life and then immediately seeing it juxtapositioned with her life with Alex when she was younger is very interesting and also believable as well. Seeing some characters that weren &# x27;t in the last two season (boo, watson etc) was nice and especially seeing miss Rosa. I have to say whole season two and four are my favourites the pilot and the first season really did an excellent job at setting the show up and while I think it had a couple of dips in quality (most of season three, parts of season five) it was a really solid show throughout it &# x27;s entire run. Piscatella torturing everyone in season 5 really fucked me up. Like legit When Barb and Carol kill their little sister. Shiiiiiit Mine has got to be red. My vote goes to Season 3 Episode 4 where she tells her family at visitation that she has a girlfriend and then proceeds to moan as if orgasming while looking her mother in the eye. It ' s the worst! Anyone else super bothered that they never explored the super obvious possibility that Pepa isn’t Yadriel’s baby? I really was curious to see how that would blow up but nothing happened. Not gonna lie: he didn’t really stand out to me that much. He was alright in the beginning, but then banging Polly just went downhill for me. I’d say I’m biased because Vause is my favourite character and favourite ship with Chapman though. Does anyone know what happened to Danny? Pipers older brother Danny is mentioned multiple times, but his only appearance was in a family photo in the first episode? Am i missing anything, or was he just forgotten about by the writers? 79.5k Members 89 Online Jun 6, 2013 Cake Day
