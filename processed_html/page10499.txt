VAT .                                                 Some landlords ask Purplebricks to employ an external inventory company to produce an inventory for their property before the move in. Where this applies, the cost is split between the landlord and tenant. Inventory documentation will detail the fixtures, fittings and condition of a property prior to the commencement of a tenancy; this will subsequently provide the basis for settlement in a deposit dispute. If an inventory is inadequate or non-existent then a deposit adjudicator is likely to award the deposit to the outgoing tenant, leaving a landlord out of pocket for any dirt or damage that is left behind.                                                     Purplebricks can arrange for an inventory to be compiled at a cost of  90 inc.   for 1 to 3 bed properties and  120 inc. VAT for 4+ bed properties. Please note that London properties will be subject to a variation on these prices,  120 inc.   for 1-3 bedrooms and  150 inc.   for 4+ bedrooms.                                                 Prospective tenants of properties in Scotland are not required to pay any of the fees detailed above.
