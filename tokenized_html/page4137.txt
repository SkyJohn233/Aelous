if giannis and yes its a big if develops a consistent 3pt shot does he have potential to be better than kd nba right now he operates mostly around the rim his post up game is developing rapidly and he x27 s getting better his handles and slashing ability has also gotten better i dont think its crazy that he will develop a solid midrange game in 2-3 years and if he goes further and develop a consistent 3 pt shot is he one of the greatest of all time he x27 s athletically like lebron with the speed and strength he has kd x27 s height and lankiness like a kd-lebron hybrid giannis wont ever be as good of a shooter as kd what does consistent 3 point shot mean volume type of shots matter if he is pulling up like kd and shooting 38 -40 he can be better but its not happening yeah it s one thing to be able to hit some wide open 3s at like 37 but being a legitimate pull up threat is something else entirely to me giannis jumper still looks pretty slow and stiff so i don t see the latter happening yeah he won x27 t ever be as good a shooter as kd at all but he doesn x27 t need to be at all giannis is a much worse shooter but he is better at the rim and better in the post he is also a better rebounder playmaker and defender than kd i still think he x27 ll never be as accomplished as kd because kd dominated almost from the start and had playoff success very early but at their peak season giannis may end up better the question isnt asking if he can become as good of a shooter as kd its asking if he can be a decent 3 pt shooter could he be a better player then kd and my opinion on that is yes i think the question wasn x27 t specifying that he needs to become as good of a 3pt shooter as kd i thought it was asking what if he could consistently shoot the 3-ball on a higher volume with even average or slightly above average accuracy i thought of someone like westbrook or john wall as comparisons they aren x27 t snipers by any means but that 3pt shot is in their arsenal and you x27 ve got ta respect it currently i don t see any indication that he ll develop into the absolutely lethal and deadly shooter that kd has been most of his career but he s still so young and now has a coach that ll let him try to develop his shot more either way he s going to be great but right now i would say no maybe yes sure if he develops a 3 he has potential to be better i thinks that x27 s a pretty safe statement it does not mean he would automatically be better absolutely true but on the other hand there are people here upvoted saying that kd is a better paint scorer than giannis now that remark is absolutely bs true he could also be better without a 3 point shot though if he becomes an elite playmaker with dpoy defense while ironing out the rest of the game he could get there i really like giannis but the man can x27 t shoot for shit he x27 s shooting sub 30 that x27 s just awful he shot over 30 last year and has improved ever year i think he x27 ll get to around 33/34 and stay at that sort of level for his career this thread is bizarre though i really don x27 t get it theres no indication he will be a consistent 3pt shooter i don x27 t think so kd x27 s offensive game is almost flawless sans passing he is 7 ft with the quickness and handle of a shooting guard and can shoot lights out up to 35 ft. a consistent catch and shoot 3pt shot would be good for him but he would need more to get to kd x27 s level imo i think saying hes athletically like lebron is understating the freak of nature that lebron was and is giannis is more like a stretched out westbrook to me athletically lebron did it giannis could as well lebrons jump shooting was miles above giannis when he entered the league and he x27 s somewhat of an exception in terms of how much he x27 s improved don x27 t see how this logic works at all lebron doesn x27 t have a consistent 3 point shot its wildly inconsistent with lefuckyouthrees he wont but sure yes but i don x27 t think it will be possible for him to be that great of a shooter 2.8m members 23.3k online nov 4 2008 cake day
