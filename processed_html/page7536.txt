Developers D2 are behind the plans to transform the Duke Street warehouse and former indoor car park into Liverpool’s first ever city centre boutique bowling alley for adults. The 16,000 sq ft development, designed by Snook Architects, will be called  PINS  and feature a bar, bowling alleys, a street food menu, VIP bowling areas, shuffleboard and other experiential games. D2 director, Daniel Gillbanks,said: “PINS will offer people an alternative way to spend their evenings and weekends. “Recently, there’s been a cultural shift in how people choose to spend their recreational time. Increasingly, people are searching for more fulfilling experiences and activities to do at the weekend, rather than simply going to the pub. "We’re proud to create a new venue that will bring 45 new job opportunities into the city while contributing to Liverpool’s increasingly diverse cultural offering, catering for all ages and interests.” Now work can begin, PINS is scheduled to open by the end of the year.
