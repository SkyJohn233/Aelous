Current Resident : &# xA0; We ' ve lived in Long Grove for 10+ years and love it.   The large lots, forest and great conservation areas make it feel so private and pastoral, yet it ' s close to everything with good train service into the city on two different lines.   And the best high school in the state (Adlai Stevenson) in my opinion!   Downtown LG (meaning the village proper) took a hit in the recession but it is coming back with several new restaurants and businesses now open.   Still very atmospheric and New-Englandy. Read  10 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Before living in Chesterbrook, I lived in Northeast Philadelphia with my four siblings and parents. When I had gotten the news we would be moving to Chesterbrook I was undoubtedly heartbroken as I would be leaving my friends and family behind in Philadelphia. However, after having spent a year living within Chesterbrook, I can say it is one of the safest neighborhoods I have lived in. The area is very family friendly, has amazing schools, and full of color. However, with great areas come downfalls. The lack of diversity within the area is quite disappointing coming from a mid suburban area. The area is also extremely costly due to the conditions of Chesterbrook and is amazing school district, making it difficult to give it a 5/5 rating. Read  47 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I love living in Penn Wynne, Pennsylvania. I have lived here for the past 15 years and spent elementary, middle, and am currently finishing up high school living in this neighborhood. Many of my friends live here, and I have met many kind people from all over Penn Wynne. Penn Wynne has a small town feeling with all of the benefits of living minutes away from Philadelphia. I love the parks and open spaces that Penn Wynne has to offer. I am not sure where I will live when I am older, but Penn Wynne will always have a special place in my heart. Read  14 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Jericho has been a very nice experience. I have always lived in the city, and moved from a city to the next for the past seventeen years of my life. I have lived in Tokyo, Shanghai, and New York City. Although Jericho is relatively close to the city, I was surprised by a lot of the aspects of life here, pleasantly. I love how close I am to the neighbors. How I know exactly who are my classmates in class. I love how I know most of the people in my school. How everyone knows who I am too. Just the welcoming and warming feeling of this town has grown on me. I think anyone who will come here in the future will enjoy being here.

Read  14 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Beautiful area with friendly neighbors and close proximity to everything you would ever need. The public and private schools in the area are some of the best in the nation. You can live in a quiet neighborhood with a nice yard and drive 15 minutes to one of the biggest malls in the country. Read  10 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I ' ve lived in Berwyn my whole live, as did my mother, father, and their parents. The community is amazing and unlike anything I ' ve seen - everyone is so welcoming and warm, they all want to be inclusive! The special events throughout the year make the town especially unique - the Turkey Raffle, the Tree Lighting, the Fourth of July parade, they all bring a close-knit community even closer. No matter where life takes me, I hope to always end up back in Berwyn. Read  26 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Ideal family community. Strong public schools. The high school has full range of AP classes, kids score 4-5 ' s.  Excellent school music and art programs. Very safe. Kids make friendships across social classes.  Religiously diverse metro area with Jewish synagogues, an Islamic mosque, a Hindu and Jain temple, churches with services in Chinese, Korean, and Spanish, African American churches, etc.  Restaurants and grocery stores from many cultures. Many cultural opportunities at MSU. Parks, trails, lakes, farmer ' s market. Read  79 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Carmel  is a friendly place, and has a higher than average diversity rate (especially compared to the rest of Indiana). There are many family friendly features, especially for young children. There are several parks, such as West Park, Founder ' s Park, and Coxhall Gardens. The Monon trail also goes through Carmel, which is a great place to get exercise. There is also a very strong public school system, as well as several private schools. Downtown Carmel includes a large library and several local businesses. However the statues downtown are a bit creepy. Carmel is also a very expensive place to live. Read  241 Reviews Niche User : &# xA0; I love how friendly everyone is in Palo Alto. The only thing that we need to continue to work on is the high population of homeless people in the area - there is a church that provides assistance but it does not have overnight accommodations. Read  2 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; It is a great place to live! I have lived there my whole life and I have never been robbed or seen a robbery happen. Very close to elementary school and middle school. Also close to a few parks that are very nice. Read  1 Review Current Resident : &# xA0; As a teenager growing up in Buffalo Grove, the majority of my plans with friends involve eating out with friends at one of the numerous restaurants around the area. There are so many amazing options for food in and around Buffalo Grove that include cuisine from almost anything you could think of. In the summer, I bike ride constantly around the area, and I never feel worried about my safety in Buffalo Grove. In order to explore some activities beyond food and dessert, you may need to venture into nearby suburbs. However, you don ' t need to travel far to experience pedal boating at Independence Grove, indoor skydiving and outlet malls at Rosemont, and other awesome options to do with friends or family. I ' ve been lucky to attend Stevenson High School, which has given me the ability to meet so many people in a diverse atmosphere. Through my AP classes and the rigor of the school, I know I will be prepare to take on college and beyond. Happy to grow up here! Read  134 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I ' ve grown up here in Newtonville, and it was such an amazing experience! Everyone is very friendly, there are plenty of places within walking distance, and the schools are amazing. Such wonderful place to live. Read  4 Reviews Niche User : &# xA0; Palo Alto is a town full of success. In the hub of Silicon Valley and in the shadow of Stanford University, people all over the world come to make Palo Alto their home. The community is a tight-knit group of people whom come from all different cultural backgrounds, ethnicities and lifestyles. Success, however, comes with a price. The school district, PAUSD, is known as one of the most prominent districts in the state. Academic pressures are high and the pressure to succeed is prominent. Read  6 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Princeton Junction is a beautiful area as it has a significant amount of greenery and farms. Its public schools are ranked very highly with respect to other schools in New Jersey. It is a very safe area, and although it is quite expensive tax wise - it is a great return on investment. Read  14 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Great small town with excellent schools and a cute downtown. Easy to get to downtown Chicago on train or highway. Cons: lack of diversity and more conservatives than I would like to live near. Also, lack of local businesses leads to higher taxes and the downtown needs some work (though it is improving). Needs better restaurants and a bar or two  that doesn &# x2019;t close at 9:30.  It &# x2019;s a safe, clean and friendly community and a really nice place to live. Read  22 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Wonderful place to live. Semi-rural atmosphere, great schools, nice people. When the creek is running, it &# x2019;s especially lovely, Read  6 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I love living in North Potomac! I have lived here my entire life.  The neighborhood is really nice and the people are friendly. The schools in the area are well-known. Shops, restaurants, gas, and night-life activities are nearby. It is a 45 minute drive to DC and an hour away to Virginia. Read  73 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I have been living in Upper Montclair, New Jersey since I was born, which is eighteen years. My town is very family friendly with multiple parks where children can play and adults can walk or bike around. There are hundreds of restaurants and local grocery stores where people can buy their food or sit down with friends. Every single person, whether it is your neighbor or someone walking down the street, is very kind and sociable. We are an extremely diverse community with different ethnicities and filled with people from around the world. Upper Montclair is very eco-friendly as we reduce the amount of waste by reusing and recycling items and people contribute to the environment by planting trees and tending to their gardens. I always feel a sense of protection when walking down a street which is provided by our local police department. I genuinely enjoy living in Upper Montclair as I have made many friends in this beautiful town!
