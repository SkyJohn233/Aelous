' The League ' : Top 15 Episodes - Page 3 THE LEAGUE  The Yank Banker  Episode 709 (Airs Wednesday, November 4, 10:00 pm e/p) Pictured: (l-r) Paul Scheer as Andre, Jonathan Lajoie as Taco, Stephen Rannazzisi as Kevin. CR: Patrick McElhenney/FX This episode was the original introduction for a fictional character that s been  making appearances  for seven seasons. Ellie is obsessed with a Mr. McGiblets toy that Kevin can t stand, so he gets a Taco to dress up as Mr. McGiblets and scare Ellie. Only problem is that Ellie was more excited than scared and she starts giving Taco  presents  from all over the house. This is also the episode where Pete and Andre go on the couples retreat that Pete had paid for when he was still married. Ruxin quickly crashes their party, with Taco showing up to lay low after robbing Kevin s house, and Kevin finally arriving to find Taco. Best moment? Probably when Pete finally realizes the hotel employee is hitting on him, not just being nice, only to blow his shot with her because Andre is watching his old sextape. Filled with plenty of one liners to go along with these situations, this early episode definitely still holds up. Well The League < \/em>will finally be coming to an end tonight.
