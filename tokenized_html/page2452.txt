2 and carbon monoxide co exert significant influence on local and regional atmospheric chemistry temporal and spatial variability of these gases are investigated using surface measurements by the central pollution control board india during 2005–2009 over six urban locations in and around the indo-gangetic plain igp and supported using the satellite measurements of these gases the stations chosen are jodhpur west of igp delhi central igp kolkata and durgapur eastern igp guwahati east of igp and nagpur south of igp among the stations studied so 2 concentrations are found to be the highest over kolkata megacity elevated levels of no 2 occur over the igp stations of durgapur kolkata and delhi columnar no 2 values are also found to be elevated over these regions during winter due to high surface concentrations while columnar so 2 values show a monsoon maximum elevated columnar co over guwahati during pre-monsoon are attributed to biomass burning statistically significant correlations between columnar no 2 and surface no 2 obtained for delhi kolkata and durgapur along with very low so 2 to no 2 ratios ≤0.2 indicate fossil fuel combustion from mobile sources as major contributors to the ambient air over these regions urban growth in asia has been occurring on an unprecedented scale and involves a volume of population much larger than in any other region of the world roth et al 2011 demographic projections show that by the year 2025 16 of the world 's 29 megacities will be located in asia many of which have very basic problems in terms of environmental quality asian development bank 2008 apart from being home to a burgeoning population these regions tropical/subtropical of the globe are also major players in atmospheric chemistry as a result of myriad emission patterns and scenarios combined with intense photochemistry crutzen 1998 ipcc 2007 in a country like india stress on the environment is a natural expenditure that has to be incurred as a price for fast-paced development and its ramifications in the form of emissions pertaining to fossil fuel combustion these emissions containing sulfur dioxide so 2 and nitrogen dioxide no 2 have the potential to impact the chemistry and radiative balance on a regional scale so 2 plays a pivotal role in the global sulfur cycle delmas and servant 1998 being an important consumer of photo-oxidants and its subsequent oxidation into particulate sulfate so 4 2− seinfeld and pandis 2006 it remains an intrinsic part of atmospheric chemistry thus knowledge of so 2 concentrations is indispensable to accurate modeling of atmospheric chemistry and radiation budget especially in regions where its concentrations are substantial so 2 may be transported several hundred kilometers mallik et al 2013 by virtue of an average tropospheric lifetime of ~1.8 days resulting from combined effects of gas-phase oxidation and dry deposition faloona 2009 changes in the abundance of so 2 and hence so 4 2− will impact the radiation field and consequently the climate ipcc 2007 tsai et al 2010 anthropogenic activities viz coal and oil burning and natural processes like volcanic eruptions release sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere during 1995 thermal power generation accounted for 46 of so 2 emissions in india followed by industry 36 road transport 8 and biomass burning 6 garg et al 2001 as of 2010 the contribution from power-generating sector has increased and the present sectoral shares to so 2 emissions are 60 from power sector 32 from industries 6 from residential and about 2 from the transport sector lu et al 2011 some other sources of so 2 are industrial activities such as flaring at oil and gas facilities diesel power generation and commercial/residential fuel use nitrogen oxides no x play a pivotal role in tropospheric ozone o 3 formation since no x no+no 2 is a precursor of o 3 an increase in no x along with myriad volatile organic compounds may affect o 3 and oh concentrations in the troposphere crutzen 1998 no 2 is the major gaseous pollutant in the no x group arising from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass burning while only a small part of no 2 is emitted directly into the atmosphere by combustion processes most of the no 2 is formed by photooxidation of no the major nitrogenous product of combustion the largest natural sources of no are lightning and microbial activity in soils bond et al 2002 bouwman et al 2002 no x emission over the asian region is observed to be increasing very fast compared to europe and usa akimoto 2003 the no x emission over india is estimated around 4.59 tg for the year 2000 with an annual growth rate of around 5.5 streets et al 2003 vehicular traffic and diesel engine-generating sets are major contributors to ambient no 2 levels in a city the no x emission breakup over the indian region is 34 from road transport sector 30 from power generation and 30 from industry garg et al 2006 however the sources vary conceivably from region to region in india both so 2 and no 2 are primary criteria pollutants with detrimental environmental effects short-term exposures to elevated levels can have significant health effects as well who 2005 these gases also have adverse effects on vegetation crops and materials it has been estimated that every 1 increase of so 2 emissions in asia results in about 0.9 rise in sulfate aerosols manktelow et al 2007 though global so 2 emissions have stabilized since 1990 indian emissions have shown a 70 increase since 1996 and estimated at 8.8 tg-so 2 for the year 2010 lu et al 2011 both no x and so 2 have precarious associations with acid deposition hidy 1994 elevated concentrations of no 2 can also affect visibility through creation of a reddish brown haze the significance of so 2 and no 2 as elucidated above necessitates their continuous observations from the perspectives of atmospheric chemistry as well as climate research and demand detailed analysis of their levels and variability particularly for the asian region documenting the long-term temporal changes in so 2 and no 2 over india associated with changes in local emissions resulting from rapid urbanization and ever-escalating demand for energy is crucial for understanding chemistry–climate relationships and subsequently to formulating mitigation policies with regard to air pollution the present paper deals with the tempo-spatial pattern of these two important gases near the surface and in the total column over geographically distinct regions covering india an effort is made to distinguish this variability in terms of in situ emissions and transport effects by the analysis of their levels seasonality and ratios the stations chosen are delhi central igp jodhpur west of igp kolkata and

and perry 1986 is 5182 part 2 2001 naaqs report 2011 in this method so 2 from ambient air is absorbed in an aqueous solution of potassium tetrachloromercurate the so 2 reacts with the mercuric salt to form a dichlorosulphitomercurate complex which resists oxidation once formed this complex is stable to strong oxidants such as ozone and oxides of nitrogen and therefore the absorber solution may be stored for some time prior to analysis the complex is made to react with acid bleached pararosaniline and formaldehyde to form an intensely colored pararosaniline methylsulfonic acid the absorbance of the solution is determined photometrically this method is sensitive to low parts per billion by volume ppbv levels the minimum detection limit is ~4 μg m −3 1 ppbv 2.6 μg m −3 relative standard deviation for this analytical procedure at the 95 level is 4.6 using standard samples no 2 is measured by jacob and hochheiser modified method jacob and hochheiser 1958 naaqs report 2011 ambient no 2

each followed by delhi 27 ppbv kolkata has been confronting with a multitude of environmental problems related to traffic and transportation drainage and sewerage garbage collection and disposal system etc durgapur the steel city of india and an industrial hub is also reeling under exacerbating air pollution nandi and gorain 2010 higher levels of no 2 over delhi kolkata and durgapur call for immediate strategies to ameliorate soaring levels of pollution the pattern of no 2 mean and sigma is similar to the pattern in no 2 maxima indicating dominant effect of stereotype sources of no 2 over these regions rather than multiple sources this is in contrast to so 2 it is to be noted from garg et al 2001 that use of gasoline/diesel in transport sector and coal combustion in thermal power sector account for over 60 of no x emissions in india the no 2 minima are higher for delhi and durgapur ~16.7 and 16.5 ppbv followed by kolkata ~13.8 ppbv the maxima for delhi durgapur and kolkata is 50 ppbv over each city as mentioned in the introduction section the transport sector accounts for more than one third of total no x emissions over urban regions thus a disproportionate rise in the number of vehicles accompanied by heterogeneous traffic conditions can also result in higher observed concentrations for no 2 in congested cities in places like delhi although various measures such as implementation of fuel efficient engines etc have been taken to mitigate ambient no 2 levels the number of vehicles has increased exponentially at the same time table 1 ghude et al 2011 it is apparent from table 1 that the total number of vehicles plying over delhi is far more overwhelming than other cities partly explaining the high no 2 levels over delhi table 2 the mean so 2 and no 2 concentrations over guwahati are found to be 2.7 and 8.7 ppbv respectively averaged monthly variations in so 2 and no 2 over different regions of india for the period 2005–2009 the station values cpcb measurements are plotted with line and points while the columnar values for the omi grids are plotted as bars it is observed from fig 3 that stations lying in igp delhi durgapur and kolkata show a pronounced winter maxima with respect to surface so 2 and no 2 values the surface so 2 and no 2 do not exhibit any clear pattern over jodhpur a semiarid city in central rajasthan with no pronounced winter most of the stations however show bimodal features with respect to columnar so 2 and no 2 loadings a pronounced maxima in columnar so 2 occurs surprisingly during monsoon june in east-central india except guwahati and july in north-west india and another elevation occurs during winter however the winter elevations over durgapur and kolkata are higher than the monsoon so 2 columns overall the so 2 columns are mostly below 3 × 10 15 molecules cm −2 it is pertinent to mention here that the highest observed monthly so 2 columnar values during 2005–2009 were in the range of 0.6–0.9 dobson units du during november 2008 for delhi durgapur and several igp stations not shown in figure due to the dalaffilla volcanic eruption in ethiopia mallik et al 2013 no 2 columns vary from a low of 2 × 10 15 molecules cm −2 over guwahati to a high of 7 × 10 15 molecules cm −2 over delhi stations where seasonal amplification is sharper in surface no 2 values viz delhi kolkata and durgapur columnar no 2 values also show distinct winter peaks ghude et al 2011 have also observed similar features over delhi durgapur and nagpur columnar no 2 exhibits a pre-monsoon elevation march and/or april apart from the regular winter elevation guwahati also exhibits pre-monsoon elevation but no winter elevation no 2 values over kolkata also show a winter maxima for surface as well as total column additionally no 2 columns over all stations except jodhpur show monsoon minima the winter maxima in both surface and columnar no 2 over kolkata also delhi and durgapur suggest contributions from surface emissions dominating columnar values and the role of boundary layer which becomes very shallow during winter meng et al 2010 since maximum columnar loadings of so 2 are seen over the igp during monsoon in contrast to elevated winter concentrations at the surface effect of transport contributing to these loadings in the free troposphere is a possibility the surface level winds during july over the igp stations are mainly south-westerly which means they are traversing the highly industrialized western region of india and adding to the already significant levels of so 2 in the igp this will not be true in case of no 2 whose levels are constantly fed by vehicular emissions that are not supposed to vary drastically during a year the strong seasonality in precipitation patterns in these regions induces a strong seasonality in the wet removal of so 2 also rai et al 2010 another possibility is the minimal loss of so 2 occurring from dry deposition during monsoon dry deposition is believed to be the second major loss process for so 2 after oxidation faloona 2009 abhay and mondal 2008 have pointed out that in the initial phase of the monsoon rainfall over the igp the concentration of suspended particulates are very high to neutralize the acidity of the atmosphere but in the later phase of rain events the neutralization is not possible due to removal of particulates which leads to increased acidity of precipitation seasonal changes in wind speed impact the dry seasonal deposition of particles also seasonality of wind-blown dust in scavenging so 2 during dry season corroborates this argument adhikary et al 2007 seasonal ratios of so 2 no 2 and co over the study regions djf winter december january and february mam pre-monsoon march april and may jja monsoon june july and august and son post-monsoon september october and november for surface no 2 the seasonal variability is very distinct over all stations except jodhpur fig 4 resulting in better delineation of the winter maxima aneja et al 2001 goyal and sidhartha 2002 the elevation in surface no 2 during winter compared to other seasons is conspicuous over kolkata and durgapur the winter to monsoon ratio in surface no 2 is highest for all the stations clearly delineating monsoon minima in surface no 2 summer concentrations of surface no 2 at durgapur and guwahati are more compared to post-monsoon values fig 4 a contrary feature is exhibited over delhi kolkata and nagpur where summer concentrations of surface no 2 are lower than post-monsoon values guttikunda and gurjar 2012 have pointed out that mixing layer heights over delhi could be several times more in summer compared to winter while surface wind speeds during summer could be three times more than during winter 1 m/s these result in higher ventilation coefficient in summer leading to effective dispersion of pollutants emitted near the surface the seasonal amplitudes of surface co is similar over all the stations with a winter maximum ratio of djf to other seasons 1 and a monsoon minimum highest djf/jja value overall surface co is always enhanced in pre-monsoon compared to post-monsoon over kolkata where so 2 concentrations exhibited a maximum winter to summer ratio interestingly no 2 values show a maximum winter to monsoon ratio fig 4 this implies that so 2 values over this station decrease more in summer while no 2 values decrease more in monsoon this is because dry deposition which is a major loss process for so 2 is operative during summer when most of the igp is under the ambit of transport from western india and arabian region during monsoon dry deposition minimizes due to washout of dust particles by marine air masses and hence loss of so 2 reduces this also corroborates the high columnar so 2 during monsoon over the study grids however absence of continental air masses also causes reduction in no 2 levels during monsoon compared to summer over kolkata further vehicular emissions which contribute more to no 2 levels than so 2 levels could be slightly lower during monsoon over kolkata where traffic conditions are not very favorable during monsoon ternary plot of normalized seasonally averaged december january and february for winter march april and may for pre-monsoon june july and august for monsoon columnar retrievals of so 2 and no 2 over different urban regions of india based on satellite omi data monthly variations in mopitt derived columnar and surface co over different urban regions of india during 2005–2009 simultaneous study of so 2 no 2 and co can reveal useful information on emission sources dominating over a region the predominant sources of these gases are different e.g. co can be used as a tracer of combustion while so 2 can be used to trace power plant emissions co columnar values mopitt daytime retrievals over the study regions are shown in fig 6 while most of the stations over the igp show a winter maxima in surface co also evident in fig 4 interestingly the columnar values peak during pre-monsoon march–may however over guwahati both surface level and columnar co are elevated around march the co values over guwahati are also notably higher compared to other stations guwahati is a major metropolis in the northeast and an important hub for transportation the city is additionally affected by emissions from refineries on the eastern sector further the region is impacted by large-scale biomass burning during the pre-monsoon which is also visible in modis fire imageries high bc daily median values of 9–41 μg m −3 over guwahati has been observed chakrabarty et al 2012 columnar no 2 values are also found to be elevated over guwahati during march–april fig 3 its climate is mildly subtropical with warm dry summers from april to late may a strong monsoon from june to september and cool dry winters from late october to march the maximum temperatures and maximum wind speeds occur during pre-monsoon over guwahati the high levels of surface and columnar co over guwahati along with substantial levels of so 2 indicate additional impact of local point sources fig 6 it must however be noted that the seasonal pattern of co and so 2 over guwahati are dissimilar the high levels could also be impacted by valley region dynamics by virtue of its location on the foothills of the shillong plateau an environmental impact assessment report over guwahati found that the study region was extremely stable f class stability for 63 time of the year indicating poor dispersion of pollutants further an increase in so 2 concentrations from 2005 to 2009 is observed for guwahati in both surface measurements and column retrievals figure not shown this is also accompanied by a positive annual trend in observed aerosol optical depth aod and rainfall in northeast stations ramchandran et al 2012 correlations of so 2 no 2 and co for surface and columnar values during the period 2005–2009 an interesting observation is that while both durgapur and nagpur have good correlations between columnar no 2 and columnar co the columnar no 2 over nagpur is not well correlated with surface no 2 unlike durgapur this indicates that surface level no 2 sources are much prevalent over durgapur but comparatively exiguous over nagpur this indicates that while nagpur is affected mainly by industrial emissions durgapur is affected both by industrial and vehicular sources the case becomes stronger later when we study the so 2 /no 2 values over these places it is interesting to note that statistically significant correlations between surface no 2 and columnar no 2 are obtained for delhi and kolkata meng at al 2010 have also obtained significant linear correlation p 0.05 between satellite and ground no 2 for several stations over china the no 2 values for kolkata and delhi passed the paired t test with shapiro–wilks normality statistics at 95 confidence interval as explained above large-scale surface emissions from these megacities would dominate columnar no 2 values over the respective regions thus producing good agreement between surface and columns for most of the large cities no 2 and co columns show good correlation the correlation of mopitt-derived surface co with surface level no 2 concentrations are 0.72 0.69 0.61 and 0.49 for kolkata durgapur guwahati and delhi respectively the correlations of mopitt-derived surface co with surface level so 2 concentrations are 0.47 for durgapur and ~0.40 for delhi guwahati and kolkata it must be mentioned that co is governed more by emissions anthropogenic incomplete combustion of carbonaceous materials and dynamics while so 2 is affected by chemistry physical loss processes dynamics and emissions both natural and anthropogenic overall the correlations of satellite versus ground measurements vary substantially from region to region box plot showing median 10th 25th 75th and 90th percentiles of so 2 in parts per billion volume /no x in parts per billion volume for different urban regions of india so 2 to no x ratios higher than 0.3 are obtained for guwahati and nagpur these cities seem to have considerable impacts from so 2 -rich point sources both these rapidly growing cities are characterized by predominant influence from industries mainly high so 2 emissions from power plants refineries chemical industries etc so 2 /no x ratios for point sources in us varied between 0.44 and 2.3 aneja et al 2001 surface measurements of so 2 and no 2 by the cpcb india during 2005–2009 for six urban agglomerations in and around the igp have been analyzed to get an insight into their temporal and spatial distributions so 2 concentrations are found to be highest over kolkata very high levels of no 2 over durgapur kolkata and delhi regions mostly representing impacts of fossil fuel combustion emphasize the need for strategies to ameliorate soaring levels of pollution over these places surface so 2 and no 2 concentrations over igp stations viz delhi durgapur kolkata and guwahati are highest during winter however columnar so 2 over most of these places show a monsoon maximum probably due to transport from source regions to higher heights and ineffective removal of surface so 2 due to reduced dry deposition columnar no 2 shows mixed features with both winter and pre-monsoon elevations columnar co loadings are highest during pre-monsoon over most of the stations high columnar values of so 2 and co are observed over guwahati indicating influence of point sources columnar maxima in no 2 during winter over delhi kolkata and durgapur are also reciprocated in elevated surface concentrations indicating major contributions of near surface local emissions to columnar loadings statistically significant correlations between columnar no 2 and surface no 2 obtained for these locations show impact of vehicular traffic pervading over these regions this feature is also supported by very low mean so 2 to no x ratios ≤0.15 indicating emissions from mobile sources as major contributors to the ambient air ratios higher than 0.3 are obtained for guwahati and nagpur which have an overwhelming influence from industries power plants etc the correlations between surface and columnar values are not good for so 2 as major emission sources e.g. stacks of power plants release this gas far above the surface to be acted upon by various transport and transformation processes the current work is an attempt to characterize emissions using measurements of gas phase tracers over the densely populated igp which is a very important region of the world high resolution data and modeling studies would enable detailed investigations of the emission characteristic in and around the igp in light of natural and anthropogenic influences and the processes controlling their transformations and transport we are thankful to cpcb govt of india for measurement and archival of so 2 and no 2 data we thank nasa ges disc for
