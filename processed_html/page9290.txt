Tel: 01608 666 062 Restores the damaged panel back to its original factory finish without the need or use of fillers or paint. Paintless Dent Removal or PDR as is it often called is a method of removing a dent or crease in a metal body panel, reinstating it back to its original factory finish. This is achieved using no fillers or paint in the process but rather carefully manipulating the metal back into its original position.   Please note: A dent or crease where the paint has cracked or split will require repainting. Damage of a structural nature such as collision or heavy impact damage, usually requires a competent and reputable body repair centre.  If you are in any doubt, feel free to call us for advice. Due to the specialist nature of PDR and for all of our PDR requirements, we work exclusively in partnership with Dent Devils Ltd and their network of IMI Awards QAA  &  ATA Certified technicians.  If you are unsure as to whether your enquiry is for a paint or PDR repair, check to see if the paint has cracked on the edge of the indentation. If it has, it will require filling and painting.   If there is no damage or marks to the paintwork then Dent Devils can probably help. If you are still unsure, call us on 01608 666 062 or send us a clear image of the dent together with a contact number and weâ€™ll try to advise you.  Dent Devils can be contacted directly on 01206 751 536 during normal office hours, alternatively  click here to visit www.dentdevils.co.uk Tel: 01608 666 062  email: enquire@nsrs.co.uk  Nationwide Smart Repair Solutions Ltd  Webdesign by NGR Design
