Whether you want a stealth looking JK, a menacing TJ or wheels that go well with any paint option on the YJ, black wheels are never a bad choice. Choose between various trusted, top of the line manufacturers like Pro Comp, Fuel Wheels, Mammoth and Rugged Ridge. Do away with the OEM wheels and upgrade to wheels that use We offer a massive selection of  Jeep Wrangler wheels  designed to fit any model that you own whether it s stock or lifted up. We have steel, stainless steel, alloy and aluminum options to choose from depending on your performance concerns. Many of our non-steel options are a good way to drop weight from your ride because they are a performance-focused lightweight alternative. Our aluminum or stainless steel wheels are built to withstand regular salt and corrosion as well and resist rusting for far longer than most OEM wheels can. Achieve the specific look and style that you want with all our different  Jeep Wrangler wheels  to choose from. There are multi-spoke designs with as many as 12 different spokes to create an intricate looking wheel. There are others with wide and thick spokes or with a solid design with small cutout holes around the diameter of the wheel. Just as there is a wide range of wheel spoke designs, there are many different color finishes to choose from among our black wheels. Choose from full black with a glossy finish for that really stealthy look, or opt for a mix of black and silver or chrome finishes for a more intricate and bright looking wheel. Good quality wheels aren t just for looks, they are also a performance upgrade in many cases. We have wheels that are built for hauling and that can withstand heavy weight loads if you plan on doing some  towing  with your Jeep Wrangler. You can also choose wheels with long-lasting warranties that guarantee the wheels will hold up for many years after installation. Whether you want wheels that will last for the life of the Jeep Wrangler, wheels that are built for rugged performance, or just wheels to enhance the look of your ride, we have the black wheel option for you. Choose with care to get all the features that you care about most and enjoy the look and performance of your ride once they are installed. If you decide that you want a larger set of wheels than the stock option, you can get those too, just invest in one of our  lift kits  first to give you the clearance you need to get them into position.
