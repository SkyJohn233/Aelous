concept that means different things to different people though no matter what success is to you it almost certainly isn t something will come easily there are countless guides and books to being successful however as success is personal and unique to each individual the advice contained in these books can often not be relevant therefore following the advice of a single individual can often be unhelpful with this in mind considering the advice of a great many people people whose ideas of success were different both to each other and quite possibly to you can be a good alternative what

are few artists as influential as michaelangelo today centuries after his death his work still inspires and connects to people his work is world famous just think of his statue of david or the mural in the sistine chapel in the vatican imagine then if he decided not to work as an artist being a successful artist has always been extremely difficult imagine if he decided to give up this ambition in favour of something easier oftentimes people often decided to put their dreams aside for something more realistic to give up their dream for something easier this quote teaches us the danger of such a point of view instead be ambitious from oprah winfrey media mogul you know you are on the road to success if you would do your job and not be paid for it this is a good quote to remember and think

a job you hate then being successful at it might only mean filling your life with something you hate to do what s the sense in this instead why not focus on doing something you love when you ve found

engine first even if you re not successful you still filled your time with something you love to do many successful musicians spent years of their lives doing unpaid performances the only reason they

mastered but both can be influenced how you go about that is the key to success all too often people think that to be successful they need to make the object of their success their life if a person thinks their job will lead them to success then they may spend countless hours per day and well into the evening working hard however this comes at the cost of rest your health and having an enjoyable life ultimately they may burn out and cease to be successful at their job anyway if success comes from having a strong social life and a good group of friends their job may suffer meaning that they may lose their job and then be unable to afford going out with friends in these ways success as phil knight says above is helped by balance think of it as a balance between rest and work or work and play to achieve that balance this ultimate guide to prioritizing your work and life can help you from henry ford founder of ford motors failure is simply the opportunity to begin again this time more intelligently there is a story it s unconfirmed whether it actually happened yet the message within is none the less true thomas edison inventing the lightbulb was the result of several hundred failed attempts in an interview he was asked how do you feel after all of your failed attempts his response was great i didn t fail i learned hundreds of ways not to invent the lightbulb he saw each failure as a lesson from that lesson he learned what won t work and also might work instead each failed attempt each rejection were key steps on his path to success it is easy to feel like you should give up after a failure but perhaps in that failure is a lesson pay attention to your failures study them perhaps then you ll learn how to succeed if you find it difficult to fight your fear of failure here s a guide for you why you have the fear of failure and how to conquer it step-by-step from colonel sanders founder of kfc i made a resolve then that i was going to amount to something if i could and no hours nor amount of labor nor amount of money would deter me from giving the best that there was in me and i have done that ever since and i win by it i know this in many ways relates to the above quote about learning from your failures it s the easiest thing in the world to give up from a failure the only way to push on is if you have the true burning desire to succeed to not be moved or dissuaded from your goals if you are not truly dedicated towards success then each failure will hurt more each set back will slow you down success is hard without the unwavering desire to succeed this difficulty may seem insurmountable with the desire it is merely an obstacle to go through from leonardo da vinci renaissance genius it had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them they went out and happened to things though it was said hundreds of years ago it works just as much today as it ever had it applies to literally any successful person think about it picture someone like william shakespeare when we think of the time he lived in we think of the time in a way shaped by him when we think of renaissance era italy we think of michelangelo and leonardo da vinci or think about the present day bill gates or steve jobs our current way of life would simply be incomparably different if they didn t accomplish what they did you re probably reading this article on a device by a company that they either founded or companies influenced by them all these figures were proactive they saw ways to do things differently and did them if they let the world shape them then they d simply fit into the background instead they shaped the world applying this to you don t be afraid of going outside the norm if you can think of a better way to do something do it that way if you fail try again from theodore roosevelt 26th president of america the most important single ingredient in the formula of success is knowing how to get along with people the best leaders and some of the most influential people and theodore roosevelt is one of the best leaders and one of the most influential people to have lived were not those who caused commotions who fought with people or disregarded people but were people who were friendly to those around them people liked them they wanted them to do well this is key to good leadership it s logical if someone likes you they want to help you if you give them a suggestion they ll gladly follow through with it but if someone doesn t like you they may either refuse to help or actively get in your way what s more it s always a good idea to cultivate good relationships you can never tell who will prove to become someone who ll be able to help you in a big way or even be a good and supportive friend as such help people and they may help you and be good to people and they my be good to you from mark twain famed author a person with a new idea is a crank until the idea succeeds it is an unfortunate truth that those with the boldest ideas are often disregarded most of us are taught from an early age to think and do things similarly to everyone else this can be great to fill an existing role but to truly do things differently and all successful people did things differently you need to think differently if you have a new idea don t throw it away because it s new and different instead celebrate it your strange new idea might one day be the one that leads you to success from walter disney founder of walt disney company if you can dream it you can do it success has to be something you can imagine yourself achieving it is possible that you will come across those who doubt you and your ability to succeed you must not become one of these people because the moment you cease believing and dreaming is the moment these dreams fall away keep dreaming from thomas jefferson 3rd president of america nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude like the above quote says you need to trust in your ability to succeed this is the only way to cultivate the right mindset replace negative thoughts with the positive ones you need to approach problems not as obstacles stopping you but merely tasks that need to be completed for you to keep going if you stay positive and think like this setbacks won t affect you so much people s doubts won t impact you and even the biggest obstacles will seem like minor problems however with the wrong mindset of doubt you ll be much easier to stop from abraham lincoln 16th president of america let no feeling of discouragement prey upon you and in the end you are sure to succeed it is an unfortunate fact of human nature all of us in some way doubt ourselves this can be made far worse if others doubt us too when surrounded by doubts giving up can actually seem like a good idea don t pay attention to the doubts if you are discouraged ignore it if this discouragement moves into your mind and you begin to doubt yourself it is important to ignore this too this is how self doubt keeps you stuck and how to overcome it

heard the quote that success is 1 inspiration 99 perspiration or you may have heard about the 10,000 hours idea whichever way you frame it they say one thing true success comes from work you ll never

inc. have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary in ancient greece there was a group of oracles who lived in delphi everyone who needed advice or to know their future visited them from the poorest of society to kings above the doorway of the temple were the words know thyself if you strongly believe and desire something chances are that you already have an idea how to get there if not you may naturally know what things will help you and what things will slow you down it s like how your body can
