mazeppa symphonic poem for details allmusic share on franz liszt was the inventor of the symphonic poem also known as the tone poem a form in which a literary or other nonmusical source provides a narrative foundation for a single-movement orchestral work liszt 's symphonic poems however were not exclusively dependent on their source material the composer 's goal was more to distill the essence of the poetic concept in music rather than to exactly recreate it mazeppa 1851 is the sixth of the twelve symphonic poems liszt wrote during his tenure as grand ducal director of music extraordinary at weimar all twelve works are dedicated to princess carolyne sayn-wittgenstein the story upon which the work is based is that of ivan mazeppa a polish nobleman of the seventeenth century who was a page in the court of the king of poland mazeppa became entangled in a love affair with the young wife of a count when the count discovered this he tied mazeppa to the back of a wild horse and chased the horse into the desert the horse eventually collapsed and the half-dead mazeppa was rescued by the cossacks he stayed with them and in due time fought with them against the russian czar peter the great eventually becoming the cossack leader in his student days in paris liszt became familiar with the works of byron and hugo both of whom wrote poems on mazeppa the story contained many attractions for the young composer including a spectrum of characteristically romantic literary elements human suffering catastrophe and triumph mazeppa is a much altered and richly orchestrated version of liszt 's same-titled transcendental piano etude aside from purely orchestrational concerns liszt 's changes to his pre-existing music served primarily to fit the work more closely to the narrative of the mazeppa story the music starts with the onomatopoetic sounds of the horse being whipped into flight the well-known mazeppa theme appears in the trombones and strings continuing unabated in numerous variations until the fall of mazeppa 's horse which is represented by a tutti chord punctuated by triplet timpani strokes the concluding section which concerns itself with mazeppa 's rescue culminates in a heroic march on a theme the composer borrowed from his earlier arbeiterchor for bass voice male chorus and piano 1848 the march theme combines victoriously with the mazeppa theme for an exciting if somewhat bombastic finale
