easy rainbow party drinks mom spark mom blogger there are lots of holidays i don t see fit to spend tons of money on is st. patrick s day a lot of fun can be am i going to spend hundreds of dollars on a shamrock covered st. patty s tree um no so when i craft for this particular holiday i try to keep things cheap or even better i try to use things that i already have on hand and i try to make things that don t need to be stored guaranteed if i start making all sorts of st. patty s decorations i won t find them this time next year they ll be in the bottom of a box long forgotten so i thought it would be fun for today s post to do something party related now this is great for now because it s rainbow themed but it is also a lot of fun for a kid s party or play date to add something neat and jazzy to the day i don t know about you but it is the out of the norm things i remember most about being a child so let s make some memories for this project you will need just mix your water and food coloring until the color is nice and dark add to your ice cube tray and freeze after frozen pop em out and get ready for some fun when one color is placed in the same glass you get a fun bright color you can even do two colors to make other colors you know yellow and red make orange and whatnot but i wouldn t recommend just tossing every color in at once i don t know if you ve ever mixed up a whole bunch of colors but the end result is ultimately brown and this isn t a tasty soda looking brown it s just nasty kids can choose their own colors and try a different one later i ve found that if something has a color kids will notice a flavor that isn t even there yellow water will suddenly taste like bananas and red like cherries so with a little bit of effort the kids can be super stoked and you can be the king or queen of the best party beverages ever a crafter since her earliest years allison spends a little time every day making something she crafts sews paints glues things onto other things and is a firm believer that a life spent creating is a life worth living visit allison 's blog dream a little bigger pingback st patrick s day roundup centsible life name required input type= text name= author id= author class= commentinput value= size= 22 tabindex= 1 aria-required='true mail required will not be published input type= text name= email id= email class= commentinput value= size= 22 tabindex= 2 aria-required='true website url input type= text name= url id= url class= commentinput value= size= 22 tabindex= 3 comment textarea name= comment id= comment class= commentinput cols= 70 rows= 10 tabindex= 4 textarea amy bellgardt is an okc mom lifestyle blogger foodie nerd coffee drinker and founder of mom spark amy has a personal blog at my 40 life contact amy here amy bellgardt is an okc mom lifestyle blogger foodie nerd coffee drinker and founder of mom spark amy has a personal blog at my 40 life contact amy here
