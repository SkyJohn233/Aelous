The anammox process ismediated by bacterial members affiliated with the phylum Planctomycetes, whichare ubiquitously detected from anoxic natural and man-made ecosystems and a keyplayer in the global nitrogen cycle. In the past two decades, phylogeneticallydifferent anammox bacteria have been recognized in natural and syntheticecosystems (i.e. 'Candidatus Kuenenia', 'Candidatus Brocadia','Candidatus Jettenia', 'Candidatus Anammoxoglobus' and 'Candidatus Scalindua'genera), and the geographic distributions of these anammox bacteria indicate thatthey have genus-specific or species-specific habitats. Recently, we revealed the physiological characteristics of 'Ca. Jettenia' in addition to 'Ca. Kuenenia','Ca. Brocadia' and 'Ca. Scalindua', and, as a result, it is possible to comparethe physiological characteristics of the anammox bacteria and discuss their nichepartitioning. Therefore, we summarize the current knowledge of anammox bacterial ecology and physiology in this review to assess the potential ecological nichepartitioning of anammox bacteria in natural and synthetic ecosystems.© 2015 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. ><
