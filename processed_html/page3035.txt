Classic cartoon underoos for adults! With bonus sexism!   the agony booth Patrons get an ad-free experience and full access to our archives. Support the Agony Booth for as little as $1/month! by  Rick Lewis  November 17, 2014  Do you live your life in a perpetual haze of nostalgia brought about by too much Tab, Pop Rocks, and  Robot Chicken ? Then you (and me) are the perfect demographic for adult-sized Underoos, which HOW HAS THIS NOT BEEN A THING BEFORE NOW?  All of your holiday shopping has been made easy by  Hot Topic , which is already having trouble keeping  its new classic cartoon underoos line in stock online (Batman is currently sold out). Sadly, they didn’t update the adult versions to boxers, but I’m sure I can get used to wearing tighty- whiteys  red-and-blueys again.  The only Marvel superhero in the bunch is Captain America; DC has Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Batgirl, and Harlequin. Then there’s He-Man and Skeletor to round out the set.  Says the  Idle Hands blog : With a bit of research, I found that Fruit of the Loom had abandoned most of their licensed undies, but only recently licensed the Underoos name to a brave group of forward thinkers who knew full well we d freak the hell out if we saw the retro packaging in stores again .AND FREAK I DID! Had the price tag not been $24.99, I would be wearing Skeletor Underoos as we speak. Not today .but soon .and often.  The price online is a discounted $19.60, so budget accordingly. The vintage boxes are an added bonus:  But what’s with this bit of sexy sexism from Hot Topic… when you mouse over the guy’s underoos, you get these alternate poses:  Untucked. Wow, what a difference that makes.  But for the women, it’s:  Na na na na na na Butt Girl!
