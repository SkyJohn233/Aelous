the reason god made us pr bertie brits malaysia s christian news website july 16 2014 jason law news 5 16 july 2014 by jason law cm pr bertie brits is very well-known in the circle of the grace gospel depending on your standpoint on the message of grace you will either view him as a renowned preacher and teacher or a notorious one what is certain is that his messages have brought freedom and changed the lives of many christians on the 6 th of july 2014 he set a foundation for his series of discourse with tncc in this first sharing he explained about the purpose god made us pr bertie shared that it is very important we understand the reason god made us many christians think the reason god made us is to serve him or to worship him and this is their starting point this is what they sincerely think christians are made for and this is their foundation as a result they teach others from this viewpoint he explained that the problem with this type of thinking is that it has led many people to defeated lives they constantly have a standard to achieve and when they reach that standard they will have a still higher one they have a mind-set of if only i achieve this god will finally find me holy and worthy and sooner or later this type of life will lead to burn-out and disappointment worse still very often bitterness sets into that person s heart this isn t the kind of life god meant for us to live as christians we re supposed to live joyful victorious lives and unless we understand why god made us we will continue to flail around and end up struggling with the feeling of condemnation and imprisonment to be a successful people of god we must know why god made us pr bertie shared the power of the gospel message must captivate our minds it must be so real to us that it infuses our whole being and change all aspects of our lives so it is not a procedural process steps etc.. where we say do this and this will result it has to be in the core of our very being. pr bertie illustrated his point by using a case study imagine this let s say that we are married and have everything in the world and then one day we say to ourselves hmm we have everything in the world but there s still something missing we still have to do things on our own we don t have others worshipping us or serving us let s have children so that they can serve or worship us and make our lives easy that way we will have a truly wonderful life and if they weaken let us put them in the desert outside of town to toughen them up. there is something obviously wrong with this picture it does not make sense this does not tally with the god who made that colossal sacrifice on calvary and yet this is exactly how many christians visualize god. so why did god made us pr bertie shared that the best way to look at the scriptures is to approach it from a family sense we know for example that god calls us his children he comes in intimate terms and uses family expressions father son daughter family bridegroom bride one body even before time itself god existed in relationship john 1 tells us that the word was with god and genesis 1:2 tells us that at creation the spirit of god was hovering over the waters the father son and the holy spirit have and always will exist together they are three distinct beings but existing in one spirit additionally the account of creation was also given through the plural pronoun when god created mankind he made us in his image genesis 1:26 so that men may have dominion over all living things god was speaking from a spiritual perspective and not a physical one and in the garden of eden god walked with adam and eve day and night so even in genesis itself the scripture tells us that the reason god made us was to have relationship and union with him and to experience everything that he experiences this is significant because it shows that from the very start god already had plans and goals for us this plan was not for us to struggle in our own efforts in acts 17:22-28 paul reminds the early christians that they and through extension we need to correct our perspectives god and men exist in totally different levels he is the lord of heaven and earth he does not dwell in temples nor is he served by human hands as if he needed anything we do not earn merit that way it is freely given through our relationship with god in god s original plan for mankind the primary aspect was the dynamics of the trinity what you share draws you closer together and when you share the dynamics of relationship you become more alike ephesians 2:10 reminds us that jesus is god s word about our lives and that god s creations speak from the foundation of this life there is no other word jesus on earth is the word of god s design for mankind and just as jesus was in union with god that is our design the devil tricked adam and eve into losing this when he directed them to focus on their own knowledge and effort men s goodness pr bertie exhorted that it is time to return to the perfection of christ when we are in christ we will finally find god s peace in our hearts we are no longer defined by what we do so we don t have to chase after human standards every work we do in christ s name becomes valuable because they are derived from who we are in him we are also no longer defined by what we have since we already have the most precious thing in the world

learned more from him in the last three years than we had learned since being born again in 1973 when i was a young child in catholic school the nuns made us memorize by rote and then recite the various questions and answers in the catholic baltimore catechism question 6 was why did god make you the answer was god made me to know him to love him and to serve him in this world and to be happy with him forever in the next. now i know what the true answer is god made me so that he could know me to love me and to serve me in this world and to be happy with him now and forever that s quite a difference i am i total agreement with this article and from the belief system from where it was written we are the god kind created to be one with him your email address will not be published comment
