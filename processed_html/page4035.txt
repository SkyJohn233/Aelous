It was just becoming available in the United States. In 2007, I pursued hands-on training in Erlangen Germany and Geneva Switzerland from the surgeons who designed the sialoendoscopes.

Honestly, the reasons I choose to be a surgeon today are slightly different to when I decided to become a physician 20 years ago. Both of my parents are physicians, and I remember seeing the influence that my mother (a family practitioner) had on her patients’ lives. Ultimately that is why I chose to become a physician, to have the opportunity to make a profound difference in peoples’ lives.What is the best part of your job?There are a number of aspects to my job that I am grateful for.

We sat down Dr. Benjamin McGrew, a neurotologist with the Department of Otolaryngology at UAB, to discuss the how earbuds can cause hearing loss and how to use them safely.Is noise from headphones more dangerous because it's closer to our eardrums? It’s really all about volume and duration of noise exposure. No headphones or earbuds are inherently good or bad for your hearing; however, sound intensity is likely increased because of the close proximity of earbuds to your ear drums.Are people experiencing hearing loss at younger ages because of the prevalence for wandering around with our headphones and earbuds in?[ ]                                                                             The Department of Otolaryngology’s endocrine volumes have been on the rise in recent years.
