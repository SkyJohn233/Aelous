These cute little teas bags are produced by Teazen, teazen.co.kr You can t help but being attracted by the names. Gangnam Sauna? I am very curious. Oh happy day? What does a happy day taste like!? They normally sell them in full boxes, but finally this store was selling the flavors in different packages. Time to try them out. I love my little Gangnam Sauna tea bag. It tastes like lemon!
