Why is this bold text not respecting CSS vertical-align:middle - Stack Overflow                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 I have a bunch of text and images in a line and i want to align vertically.  It all seems to work except I just added some bold text and the bold text seems to show up a little lower than the regular text. here is a screenshot: here is a simpliried view of my html: here is my css: if I remove the bold tag, it seems to line up correctly: I have a bunch of text and  images  in a line So when you use  .midAlign *  it applies to all the elements, so the face is you don't need to apply that property to all elements, you need that for  img  only so use And it will solve the issue. Demo Also, when you use the  *  selector, it impacts the performance, you are using that for no good reason for this particular case. I will explain you why that happened.  b  and  img  both are  inline  elements, so when you apply  vertical-align: middle;  it aligns the element to the  baseline , so say we have an  img  and a  b  tag, so  b  will be vertically aligned middle  considering the entire height of an element ... see this So when you are using  middle  as the value, it's  middle  but, to the entire element height and not just your text Demo So technically your  b  tag was aligned middle vertically, but it's just that you don't have to align that, so use specific element selector instead of a generalized  *  selector. The problem is that the  .midAlign * only  applies to the  < b >  element. Just removing the  *  solves the problem.
