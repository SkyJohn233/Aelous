Named by Travel + Leisure as one of the world’s greatest hotels, the Landmark Mandarin Oriental offers an exclusive, luxury retreat in the heart of Hong Kong’s business and fashion district. As part of KPF’s multi-phased renovation of the Landmark at the heart of Hong Kong’s Central district, the Mandarin Oriental comprises 101 guest rooms and 12 suites, the renowned Amber restaurant, the MO bar, and a state-of-the-art spa with indoor pool. The hotel occupies the first 14 floors of the Edinburgh Tower. KPF’s transformation, created in collaboration with interior designer Adam Tihany, included the planning of a bespoke entry experience and the design of a suspended, three-story exterior wall of folded vertical glass panels that envelopes the hotel entrance and new retail podium along Queen’s Road Central, unifying the complex’s disparate elements and giving them a distinct and compelling identity.  2019  Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates PC             Cookie Notice  |                 Privacy Notice
