reddit have you ever tried a hypnosis video on youtube what were the effects askreddit yes i fell asleep i x27 ve watched one and came to the conclusion that they x27 re complete and utter bullshit there x27 s no way to get excited by relaxing there x27 s no way to improve a brain by not using it and there x27 s no way a ten minute session is going to solve complex problems or make a lasting change in a long term habit but i understand other people x27 s curiosity regarding those videos if you want my opinion if you want to better yourself and have better experiences skip the hypnotherapy get out from in front of the computer and go do something i have i actually used it to get over a boyfriend it didn x27 t work but it did help me relax why is this nsfw because op is hoping to get some jerk off material because there are some nfsw hypno movies not on youtube but guess what it didn x27 t work 25.6m members 105k online jan 25 2008 cake day
