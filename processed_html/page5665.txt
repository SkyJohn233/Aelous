Field tiles - Campbell Tileworks Field tiles are available in 15 different sizes from 1x1 to 6x6 inches. The actual dimensions of all made-to-order field and accent tiles are slightly smaller than the nominal size to allow for a 3/16" grout line.   Made-to-order tiles take approximately 4 weeks to complete depending on the quantity needed.  Very large orders may take longer.  I try to keep samples in stock for immediate shipment.  Contact me for a current estimate of the turnaround time at campbelltile@gmail.com.
