Baseline: The Baseline Player of the Week: Diego Schwartzman by  Niko Vercelletto TAGS: El Peque in five! @DieSchwartzman  outlasts big man  @KAndersonATP  to advance to the  #RG18  final 8.  pic.twitter.com/dOtcaygomc Not many players come back from two sets down during the second week of a Grand Slam. At the French Open, Diego Schwartzman defied the odds by fighting back after a disastrous first two sets against Kevin Anderson. The match was an epic 1-6, 2-6, 7-5, 7-6 (0), 6-2, complete with dram. Schwartzman wasn't a huge fan of Anderson constantly pumping himself up throughout the match. ...clearly Diego Schwartzman is not into Anderson's new soundtrack. He sought commiseration from chair umpire Veljovic.  #RG18 pic.twitter.com/6F4pQbISQ1 Schwartzman moves on to the quarterfinals where he will face friend Rafael Nadal. The two have battled five times before, with the Argentinean never scoring a win. This is the first time the world No. 12 has made it this far at the French Open. —Tennis Channel Plus features up to 10 courts of live action from Roland Garros beginning Sunday, May 27 at 5:00am ET. —Catch up and watch all your favorite stars anytime on-demand with Tennis Channel Plus. —When you buy Tennis Channel Plus, your 12-month subscription gets you access to every ATP Masters 1000 tournament played outside the U.S., and every round through the finals of WTA Indian Wells, Miami and Cincinnati.
