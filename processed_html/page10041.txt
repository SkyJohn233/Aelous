We waited until we could find an affordable apartment off of 8th and St Charles and have never been happier!

As far as schools go, Lusher is the best public school in the area, but the high demand makes it rather difficult to get your kids in to that school. Overall, it &# x2019;s still a great location. There &# x2019;s plenty to do, with easy access to groceries, parks and the streetcar line. Read  2 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I love this city, and particularly this neighborhood.

My dogs get out regularly and they will bring them back if they ' ve been out too long or call me to let me know where they are. It ' s not perfect, but it ' s pretty good. Housing prices are going up as there area is gentrifying, but it is a convenient location. Not a long commute to other areas in the city and easy access to the interstate. The biggest complaint is probably the broken streets, but that ' s all over the city.
