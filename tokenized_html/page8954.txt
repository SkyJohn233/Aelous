robert desnos foujita wrote about his third wife youki whose legal name was lucie badoud she also happened to be desnos s lover foujita who was bound for rio de janeiro with the dancer madeleine lequeux asked his friend to care for youki and bequeathed to her all of his paintings those of the era featured in foujita painting in the roaring twenties at the musée maillol at that time foujita was a highly successful painter associated with the bohemian circle of montparnasse later called the school of paris. throughout the 1920s in paris foujita cut an arresting figure a japanese modernist as willing to trade on his own foreignness as he was to blend into his parisian surroundings there are not a lot of artists author of the 1925 monograph on foujita michel-g. vaucaire wrote who have reached a remarkable situation of passing for a french painter in the eyes of the japanese and for a japanese in those of westerners. born in 1886 into an aristocratic military family in tokyo foujita moved to paris in 1913 at the louvre he copied old masterworks particularly gold-leafed madonnas he became close friends with the painters chaïm soutine and amedeo modigliani foujita s second wife the artist fernande barrey was one of modigliani s models among foujita s early works from 1913–1924 are haunting and somber cityscapes of paris—for example l entrée de la cour de l atelier 5 rue delambre 1921 unlike those of the nabis or the fauves his paintings were drained of color almost like photographic prints he attempted neither abstraction nor cubism it s one of this exhibition s fascinating surprises noted in anne le diberder s catalog essay that from 1914 onward foujita knew the photography of eugène atget by 1920 he possessed copies of both paysages et documents and la topographie du vieux paris by the late 1910s foujita s aesthetic had taken one of its many turns he made a series of ink drawings and watercolors on paper mostly of women these borrowed from japanese composition with figures that resembled those of modigliani—perhaps at times too much such as in la dégustation 1917 in which two entwined figures share a small carafe and cup this mixture of european models and japanese sensibilities is his most consistent stylistic quality in an otherwise varied oeuvre in the 1920s he found his greatest success with oil paintings and ink and pencil drawings of women particularly portraits of youki while he was celebrated for these works in retrospect his self-portraiture from that decade is even more captivating at the musée maillol those vibrant self-portraits sometimes including cats are displayed across from photographs of foujita taken by his friend andré kertész showing the artist on the telephone reading drinking from oversized jugs or being playful in photography and self-portraiture foujita fashions himself as a character perhaps that is why his work still feels alluring and contemporary although it is sometimes uneven in quality despite the inconsistent stylistic transformations foujita himself is constantly present at the height of his popularity in 1928–1929 foujita received two commissions in paris grande composition 1928 is his large-scale four-panel masterpiece featuring an arrestingly bizarre menagerie of humans and animals its approach merged michelangelo s attention to human musculature with lions and tigers in cages as well as free-roaming dogs and cats that are reminiscent of classical chinese and japanese painting a year later the other commission décor du cerle de l union interalliée was a stark contrast to grande composition the exquisite décor was instead a traditional japanese landscape painting with animals in a manner that could have come from centuries earlier while the difference between the two speaks to foujita s versatility it also leaves an impression that he was willing to take on any commission and execute it in any style after leaving france in 1931 and spending years travelling in the americas he returned to japan where he sided with the empire during its fascist period in 1950 foujita emigrated to france because his imperial sympathies made it difficult for him to remain in his homeland after its defeat five years later he was naturalized as a french citizen converted to catholicism and even took the western name léonard it s ironic that during that decade the fourth and then the fifth republics of france were ferreting out their own fascist collaborators from the wartime period of the vichy government and yet welcomed their japanese prodigal son he took up residence in villiers-le-bâcle a town southwest of paris and focused on religious paintings particularly the murals of a chapel in reims completed in 1966 two years before his death one painting included in the exhibition from his wartime years in japan is particularly poignant removed from the modernism of his montparnasse days foujita sept ans is a realistic self-portrait based on a childhood photograph a somber-looking image in the sepia-tone colors he applied in his work of the 1910s it s hard not to see the painting as rueful imbued with a longing for the past although it s unsure which or what kind of past foujita painting in the roaring twenties is at the musée maillol through july 15 1963-2019 nyrev inc. all rights reserved
