Royal Enfield motorcycles are one of the last few legacies of the British Raj that remained in India long after the colonial rulers left us. Bullet is just one model of motorcycle produced by the company, though the model has become synonyms with the brand to the extent that any motorcycle sporting the Royal Enfield logo is known as a Bullet. Kolkata has always had a vibrant community of Bullet riders; the brotherhood amongst riders remained largely confined to small pockets or 'paras' and often revolving around specific mechanics, where friendship between Bullet owners formed simply due to the fact that the bikes get serviced by the same guy.
