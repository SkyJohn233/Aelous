Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, Prince Charles '  goddaughter, dies Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, former London party girl and a god-daughter of Prince Charles, has been found dead at her London home. She was 45. The prince said in a statement that he and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, were  deeply saddened  by news of her death on Wednesday. Our thoughts are so much with the family,  he said. The cause of death was not immediately clear, though Palmer-Tomkinson revealed last year that she had been diagnosed with a brain tumour. Palmer-Tomkinson was a fixture on the international social stage throughout the 1990s. She was regularly photographed partying with the rich and famous, and helped fuel her reputation as a wild child with regular media appearances. Known by Britain s tabloids as  T-P-T,  her entertaining life contained as many lows, including public meltdowns, as it did highs. She had a highly publicised, and reportedly very expensive, cocaine habit that led to the collapse of her nasal septum, which had to be surgically repaired. In revealing her brain tumour late last year, she said she had been diagnosed in January after being treated for a benign growth on her pituitary gland. She told British media:  I m not the person I was, I m much calmer. I don t go to places like Ibiza because the party world scares me. Her parents, Charles and Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson, are said to be close friends of Prince Charles and other members of the royal family. She is descended from land-owners and Olympic skiers   her grandfather, uncle and father all competed at multiple Olympic Games. She attended the wedding of Prince William and the Duchess of Cornwall. Get The New Daily free every morning and evening. Follow The New Daily  Copyright   2019 The New Daily. All rights reserved.
