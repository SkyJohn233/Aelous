And Joe Sugg and  Strictly Come Dancing  partner Dianne Buswell fuelled dating rumours as they made a cosy exit from a  London  studio together on Thursday evening. The  YouTube  star and professional dancer looked to be enjoying a low-key evening together as they stocked up on food after a long day of rehearsals. Dianne was casually clad in a black jumper and skinny jeans, with the Australian beauty giving her look some added pizzazz with the addition of a silver shearling jacket.   Joe mimicked her casual style in a beige hoodie and shorts, which he layered above thermal trousers for some extra warmth.  The dancing duo, who have struck up a close bond since meeting on the show, looked completely at ease with one another as they shared a chat and laughed at one another's anecdotes.   Joe and Dianne recently revealed they have been spending 13 hours together in training every day for their samba amid claims the pair are dating each other. Dianne said on It Takes Two: 'It’s a very hard dance but we are working so hard we’ve worked from nine till ten everyday so far. 'So I have every bit of faith that Joe will deliver the goods, but we’re working hard so we’re doing very well.' They have reportedly been growing closer and reports claim they are enjoying a secret romance following Dianne's split from Anthony. It's been reported by The Sun that the pair often spent time at Joe's home together, with Dianne said to have stayed over a few times. A BBC source told the publication: 'Joe and Dianne are keeping things low-key but they’re having a lot of fun. Everyone on set has noticed how close they’ve become. 'They’re definitely more than just friends. They are very fond of each other. They are hoping to stay in the contest for as long as possible and are trying to focus on dancing for now, but they’re seeing where things go.'  The comments below have not been moderated
