extended frenkel excitons in one-dimensional narrow-band systems sciencedirect a model is developed for excitons in a linear chain of dimers of radical ions in the region intermediate between the nearly free-electron limit and the localized-electron limit when only on site electron—hole interactions are taken into account an extended exciton state results which in the limit of zero bandwidth is the normal frenkel exciton solution for the case of rbtcnq it is shown that from a comparison of the experimentally found dipolar splitting parameters and the calculated ones it may be concluded that the on site electron—hole interaction and the one-electron bandwidth are of the same order of magnitude for this salt
