style to the airport review of aerofleet services toronto canada tripadvisor i asked for a quotation from the pearson int l airport to oshawa 75.the final charge was 93.00 read more i booked a day ahead assuming for a 5:30 am pick up they d be on time wrong they were 15 mins read more great service on time and beautiful limo to take us to the airport for our vacation we had 0 issues and would definitely use again the price of 55.00 was good considering a taxi would cost more from our location to the airport when i called i was kept on hold for three minutes and then cut off i eventually got back to them they sent a car to the terminal one prearranged area i was waiting inside i waited for 15 minutes the driver did n't bother to come inside to the desk he then drove away it 's a dreadful service we used aerofleet services twice during our stay in toronto both times the drivers were very professional and smart the cars were comfortable and clean the drivers took our cases to put in the car making our journey hassle free. br our return journey was booked online 24 hours earlier and the car arrived on time there must be many taxi companies in toronto but i can fully recommend aerofleet as they provide a professional service at a affordable price. p date of experience may 2016 ask sarahpwiltshire about aerofleet services thank sarahpwiltshire this review is the subjective opinion of a tripadvisor member and not of tripadvisor llc minao2014 paris france 38 9 reviewed 26 august 2016 google translation
