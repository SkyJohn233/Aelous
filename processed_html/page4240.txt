Acura RDX: 2019 Motor Trend SUV of the Year Finalist - Motor Trend WE LIKE  Winding road handling, excellent packaging WE DON'T LIKE  Vague brakes, infotainment interface Acura  has stepped up its game with the new compact RDX, but it's trying to be all things to all buyers. The Acura's wide net leads to confusion about what aiming to be. "It's torn between being luxurious and soft like a  Lincoln , sporty like an Alfa, or techy like an  Audi , and those things sorta cancel each other out," Christian Seabaugh observed. With a powerful 2.0-liter turbo-four engine derived from the Civic Type R, the RDX sends power to all four wheels via Acura's Super Handling All-Wheel Drive. We enjoyed driving the RDX on winding roads in Sport+ mode, but we didn't feel the emotion we expected. Overall, "the drive, the package, and the cargo space at the price Acura is asking make this a fairly compelling prospect," Frank Markus said. However, there was one unanimous complaint: the RDX's vague braking feel and response. Given that Acura equipped the RDX with "limousine" brakes, slowing down precisely was frustrating for many. Said Scott Evans: "Trying to make a stop sign is much harder than it needs to be." The exterior design is a step forward for Acura, but its busy lines and massive grille and logo kept it from winning our hearts. Inside, there's a steep learning curve to control the infotainment system via its touchpad, which Angus MacKenzie described as "distractingly difficult to use on the road." We also highlighted its active safety technologies, like the accurate lane keeping assist software and the adaptive cruise control that maintained a set speed on steep downhills. "I was impressed by the Acura," Gordon Dickie said. "To me, it's a quantum leap forward to capture more market share in this segment."
