of reasons this practice of repealing spent amending acts is not unique or new to nsw at one stage the amending acts were repealed in batches twice a year as part of the statute law amendment process and from 2006 to 2008 contained a self-repealing clause it should be noted that once an amendment of a principal act that is made by an amending act has commenced the repeal of the amending act does not affect the amendment that has been made section 30 of the interpretation act 1987 this screen enables you to search consolidated in force and repealed legislation these databases are partitioned into three major types of legislation acts regulations etc and environmental planning instruments epis before searching you should first select the database and types of legislation you wish to search by selecting the appropriate check box/es in the area under what do you want to search over the default search selection is over the acts in force and regs etc in force databases there are two forms of searching the most commonly used being the standard search the two forms of searching operate exclusively and separate search buttons are provided for that reason the advanced search feature is for more specialised searching using command control language boolean operators should not be used in the standard search the standard search has a range of pre-defined search fields that are listed below and it also enables you to search over the text or title of legislation and to limit your search to a particular year and/or instrument number these fields enable you to limit your search as follows exact phrase will find only those documents that contain those words as a phrase all of the words will find provisions in documents that contain all of the words that you enter in this field for example this search can be used to find documents with sections or other provisions that contain all of the words offence penalty and defence any of the words will find those documents that contain any one of the words that you enter in this field without the words will find provisions in documents that do not contain the words that you enter in this field this field is often used in combination with the other fields for example to find sections or other provisions in documents that contain the word offence but not the word imprisonment you can enter words into all or some of the input fields shown—the search will take them all into account the search fields are not case sensitive and do not require quotation marks around words or phrases the wildcard characters any number of characters and exactly one character can be used in all fields except exact phrase see advanced search search in the text and title selections cause the search to be applied to either the text of documents or to legislation titles note a title search covers the official titles of legislation not the titles of chapters parts schedules etc limit search to year/number will apply the search to instruments assented to or made in that year or with that instrument number if you want more control over your searching you can use the advanced search option it requires queries to be entered using the common command language ccl —an international standard for text queries please note that the search scope that you have selected with the checkboxes under the what do you want to search over field does apply to the advanced search note also that if you type a query into the advanced search field then no other field will be taken into account except the search scope ie the types of legislation you chose to search under the what do you want to search over field advanced search options such as boolean operators and proximity queries will return results of documents that contain individual provisions such as sections that meet the search criteria these types of advanced searches only apply at that provision level and are not applied to the document as a whole ccl features are outlined below and or not can be used between terms for example jury and district not sheriff using the syntax field=word the search can be restricted to individual fields useful fields in this database include text the full text of the document title the title of the act statutory instrument etc actno act numbers srno statutory instrument numbers epino environmental planning instrument numbers year year of act statutory instrument epi heading text of all headings for chapters parts divisions etc an example fielded search is heading=certified and text=appeal fielded searches are not available for the search as made or search bills means any number of characters and means exactly one character for example fee would match fee feedlots fees wom n would match woman or women if you want to search for two words near each other then the character can be used to indicate the number of words you will allow between the two terms whatever the order of the words if you want to search for words near each other in a particular order then the character can be used to indicate the number of words you will allow between the two terms for example right 3 appeal would find right and appeal within 3 words of each other in any order right 3 appeal would find the words within 3 words of each other where right occurs before appeal parentheses can be used to group search terms for example to find expressions such as the corporations act companies act corporations code or companies code use the following syntax corporations or companies 3 code or act similarly you can combine proximity and grouping searches for example building 3 code or regulation or building 3 code or regulation would find code or regulation where occurring after building to modify or refine your search go back to the search screen or select search again your search criteria will show and can be modified and the search run again to start a new search click the clear button at top right on the search screen the nsw legislation

constitutional enactments set out in part 1 of the second schedule to the act were preserved including magna carta the bill of rights of 1688 and certain acts relating to the succession of the crown the succession to the crown act 2015 cth was enacted at the request of each of the states and mirrors legislation in other countries including the united kingdom that have the queen as head of state the principal object of the act was to provide that succession to the crown was not to be determined by reference to the sex of a person as a result the first child whether male or female of the monarch will be first in line to the throne the act also amended or repealed some of the english or british acts including some preserved by the imperial acts application act 1969 nsw relating to succession to the crown in their application to australia and its states the following documents outline some of the drafting practices of the nsw parliamentary counsel s office the pco these documents express the official views of the pco concerning those practices as explained in dp1 using pco drafting practice documents dp1 using pco drafting practice documents dp2 pco plain language policy dp3 pco gender neutral language policy dp4 drafting savings and transitional provisions dp5 legislative definitions the legislation of new south wales is generally drafted by the nsw parliamentary counsel 's office which also maintains this website although the parliamentary counsel 's office chooses the words used in legislation it does not choose the policy that is being implemented and is not involved in how it is administered questions about the policy contained in legislation or its administration should be raised directly with the relevant government department in the case of acts of parliament and legislation made by the governor or the person or body that makes the legislation in other cases the parliamentary counsel 's office can not assist you with these questions there are 3 main types of legislation made in new south wales acts of parliament subordinate legislation environmental planning instruments an act of parliament sometimes called a statute is a law that has been passed by both houses of the parliament of new south wales that is the legislative assembly and legislative council and assented to by the governor on behalf of the queen an act commences life as a proposed act called a bill which is introduced and debated in both houses of parliament a bill is sometimes amended by a house of parliament during its passage there are 2 kinds of bills a government bill is a bill that is introduced into parliament on behalf of the government by a minister or parliamentary secretary a non-government bill is a bill introduced into parliament by a member of parliament in his or her capacity as a member and not on behalf of the government although sometimes on behalf of an opposition party each house of parliament has a special procedure governed by its own standing or sessional rules and orders for how a bill should be introduced debated amended and passed the website for the parliament of nsw contains further information about these special procedures a bill that is passed by both houses of parliament must be signed by the governor which is called giving assent or the royal assent to become an act when the governor assents to an act it is said to have been enacted the commencement of a new act will depend on the commencement section usually section 2 it may be the date of assent a later day specified in the commencement section or a day that is left to be appointed by the governor by a future proclamation subordinate legislation is law made under the authority of a power conferred by an act of parliament on this website subordinate legislation is simply listed under or referred as regulations even though it includes other types of instruments acts often confer the authority to make subordinate legislation on the governor however acts sometimes confer the authority on other persons or bodies for example ministers courts and tribunals and public officials the most common example of subordinate legislation is a statutory rule section 21 1 of the interpretation act 1987 defines a statutory rule to be a regulation by-law rule or ordinance made by the governor or a regulation by-law rule or ordinance made by another person or body that must be approved or confirmed by the governor for example a university by-law made under section 36 of the university of sydney act 1989 or a rule of court which is a rule made by the person or body having power to make rules regulating the practice and procedure of a court or tribunal however the governor no longer makes ordinances part 6 of the interpretation act 1987 provides that written notice of the making of a statutory rule must be tabled before each house of parliament within 14 sitting days after it is published on the nsw legislation website that is this website either house of parliament may pass a resolution that disallows a statutory rule at any time after it is published however notice of a resolution to disallow a statutory rule must be given no later than 15 days after the written notice of its making is tabled a statutory rule can be disallowed even if only one house of parliament passes a disallowance resolution the disallowance of a statutory rule operates to repeal it and to reinstate the legislation in force before the changes made by the statutory rule also section 8 of the subordinate legislation act 1989 prevents the remaking of a disallowed statutory rule in substantially the same terms for 4 months examples of other kinds of subordinate legislation include but are not limited to the following proclamations made by the governor that commence provisions of acts proclamations made by the governor that alter local council areas or amalgamate them under the local government act 1993 rules made by the legal profession admission board concerning the admission of lawyers water sharing plans made by order under the water management act 2000 proclamations orders notices or other instruments that operate to amend an act see for example final determinations under the biodiversity conservation act 2016 subordinate legislation that is not a statutory rule can not be disallowed by parliament unless the act under which it is made expressly provides for it see for example section 26 of the marine estate management act 2014 which provides that proclamations under that section can be disallowed in the same way as statutory rules all statutory rules must be published on this website before they can take effect other subordinate legislation will usually be required to be published in either the gazette or on this website by the act under which it is made environmental planning instruments sometimes called epis are local environmental plans leps and state environmental planning policies sepps that are made under the environmental planning and assessment act 1979 environmental planning instruments unlike statutory rules can not be disallowed by parliament although they are made under the authority of an act environmental planning instruments are treated as being a distinct category of legislation separate from other subordinate legislation local environmental plans are made for particular local government areas they are made either by the greater sydney commission if it relates to land in the greater sydney region under the greater sydney commission act 2015 or the minister for planning if it relates to other land they may also be made by a delegate of the commission or the minister new local environmental plans usually adopt certain provisions specified by the standard instrument local environmental plans order 2006 made by the governor under section 33a of the environmental planning and assessment act 1979 state environmental planning policies are made for either the whole of the state or special areas of the state they are all made by the governor all environmental planning instruments and amendments to the standard instrument local environmental plans order 2006 must be published on this website before they can take effect an act sometimes called a statute of new south wales a nsw act is a law that has been passed by both houses of the parliament of new south wales that is the legislative assembly and legislative council and assented to by the governor on behalf of the queen a proposed nsw act is called a bill while it is in the parliament and may be amended by either house of parliament during its passage see also how legislation is made this information is limited to how to read nsw acts and does not necessarily explain how the acts of the commonwealth and those of the other states and territories should be read generally speaking there are 2 kinds of nsw acts a principal act is an act that contains substantive legal provisions that are not limited to the repeal or amendment of other legislation an example of a principal act is the crown land management act 2016 an amending act is an act that is limited to provisions that either repeal or amend other legislation or both an amending act typically has the word repeal or amendment or both in its name see for example the industrial relations amendment industrial court act 2016 the use of an amending act is not the only way in which other legislation can be repealed or amended it is common practice for amendments and repeals of other legislation to be included in a principal act usually in schedules if they are required for the principal act to come into force section 30c of the interpretation act 1987 will repeal an amending act once all of its repeals or amendments have commenced unless the act provides differently this will usually occur on the day after it is fully commenced however the repeal of an amending act does not undo any of the repeals and amendments it makes because of section 30 of the interpretation act 1987 an amending act usually has 2 structural elements the body of the amending act and the schedules to the amending act the typical amending act will include only the citation and commencement sections for the act in its body any repeals or amendments will usually be located in one or more of its schedules if the repeals or amendments are limited in nature they may sometimes be included in sections in the body of the act rather than in schedules in commissioner of taxation v consolidated media holdings ltd 2012 hca 55 at 39 the high court of australia summarised the basic approach to statutory interpretation sometimes called statutory construction as follows 'this court has stated on many occasions that the task of statutory construction must begin with a consideration of the statutory text so must the task of statutory construction end the statutory text must be considered in its context that context includes legislative history and extrinsic materials understanding context has utility if and in so far as it assists in fixing the meaning of the statutory text legislative history and extrinsic materials can not displace the meaning of the statutory text nor is their examination an end in itself here are some practical tips to follow when interpreting nsw acts the ordinary meaning of text is always the most important starting point if the text has a clear and unambiguous meaning the courts will give it that meaning to understand an act you need to look at it as a whole document rather than as a discrete set of provisions it is wrong to read provisions in isolation without considering other provisions for example definitions that might be located somewhere else in the act or savings and transitional provisions located at the end of the act if a provision of an act could have more than one meaning section 33 of the interpretation act 1987 requires the meaning that promotes the purpose or object of the act to be preferred to a meaning that would not the purpose or object of an act can sometimes be found by looking for purposes or objects expressly stated in the act however often there will not be an express statement in the act sometimes the purposes or objects are obvious simply by looking at what the act is dealing with in some cases looking at relevant extrinsic material will be useful extrinsic material is material that is not included in the text of the act section 34 of the interpretation act 1987 permits the use of certain extrinsic material to confirm the ordinary meaning of an act or to determine the meaning of ambiguous or obscure provisions or provisions whose ordinary meaning would lead to manifestly absurd or unreasonable results examples of relevant extrinsic material are the explanatory note for the bill introduced in parliament that resulted in the act and speeches made by ministers and other members of parliament about that bill although the definitions for terms used in the act will ordinarily be included in the act sometimes they will be found in the interpretation act 1987 for example section 21 of that act defines certain words and expressions that are commonly used in legislation the interpretation act 1987 has many other provisions that are useful when reading acts and should be consulted before deciding whether or not an act deals with a matter see also guide to interpreting nsw legislation from the first executive council meeting after the 2019 state election instruments drafted by pco and made at executive council meetings that are

legislation such as acts regulations and environmental planning instruments is generally limited in addition searches on the in force collection on the nsw legislation website do not search over words appearing in graphics however where they are clearly necessary or useful graphics can be included in legislation subject to the constraints and specifications set out below typically graphics in nsw legislation consist of line art drawings diagrams simplified maps and plans flowcharts where graphics are required as early as possible in the drafting stage the use of the graphics should be discussed with the drafter graphics in the required file format should be supplied in time to allow review and revision as needed see below for the required file format the required file format is tiff tagged image file format with the following specifications format version 5 or 6 or equivalent 300 dpi or if the detail in the graphic requires it 600 dpi and 256 8-bit greyscale or colour and if a tiff can not be supplied liaise with the drafter about other options scanned images are not of sufficient quality and will not be accepted except for resizing where required to fit in standard nsw a4 legislation format pco does not create or edit the content of graphics such as maps diagrams etc these must be supplied by the agency only some flowcharts may be created and managed by pco by prior arrangement pco will create a gif file from the tiff for website publishing graphics should have the following features headings captions and other descriptive text should not form part of the graphic this information will be included as text so that it is searchable the graphic should have portrait orientation unless the dimensions make landscape necessary landscape graphics should be rotated counter-clockwise relative to portrait most graphics should not have borders except some maps where the borders give the area definition in the page graphics must be sized to fit appropriately in the legislation to which they relate and in any case can not be larger than the space in the standard text margin for nsw legislation based on an a4 page 210mm × 170 mm graphics should be cropped to a maximum of 2mm white space colour should only be used where it is important for the meaning of the graphic such as in road signs in bills graphics must be greyscale for printing reasons if colour is required for a bill check with the drafter at pco about options maps must have a scale bar and north point do not use scale measures such as 1cm=1,000m as the size of the graphic will change photographs are not suitable for inclusion in in force legislation graphics should look sharp and clear and not pixelated or blurry pco may advise on and change the size alignment in the text and similar layout aspects of the graphic to make it display effectively in legislation pco will not change the content of the graphic agencies preparing their own instruments for publication on the nsw legislation website or in the gazette should prepare graphics/images as follows the graphics should be included in the text of the instrument they should not be separately supplied for publication graphics must be sized to fit appropriately in the instrument and fit on a standard a4 page with margins of 20mm headings captions and other descriptive text should not form part of the graphic this information should be included as text to improve searchability graphics should have portrait orientation unless the dimensions make landscape necessary landscape graphics should be rotated counter-clockwise relative to portrait photographs should be avoided unless absolutely necessary line art drawings diagrams maps and plans are more suitable for legislation graphics should not be scanned images if your instrument is expected to be included in the in force collection on the legislation website the technical requirements under instruments drafted by parliamentary counsel s office pco should also be considered see below for important information about government notices council notices and private notices please note that pco will not provide legal advice in relation to
