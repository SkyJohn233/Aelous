pop royalty such as drake and alicia keys jamie smith explains why going solo with his debut album in colour suits him just fine alexis petridis thu 28 may 2015 10.23 edt last modified on mon 3 dec 2018 10.35 est j amie smith thinks his interest in dance music might have come from his family as a kid two of his uncles were djs the first lived in new york he played in bars it was around the whole chill-out thing he was playing latin music he used to send mix cds over every christmas. he has a vague memory of going to new york to see his uncle play or at least he thinks he does i have this thing in my head that i did go to a bar and hear him but i don t actually know if it s real i might have just made it up when i was younger because he talked about it all the time. the other uncle who taught the 10-year-old smith how to mix two records on a pair of turntables was based in the slightly less glamorous environs of sheffield he played house music on a pirate station then got his own show on kiss fm and it was there that smith – better known these days as jamie xx – made his radio debut or rather didn t make his radio debut he took me to the studio in sheffield and tried to get me to speak on the radio. there s a pause how did that go smith frowns i didn t speak. it s tempting to suggest that here is an example of an artist starting how he meant to go on twenty-six-year-old smith may be many things – one third of the xx an acclaimed dj and remixer a producer by appointment to r b royalty including drake and alicia keys and the author of a fantastic solo album in colour – but one of pop s natural raconteurs isn t among them i meet him twice in a cafe around the corner from his home in east london and in liverpool before he djs at freeze an event that takes place in a ruined church there is little eye contact some awkward silences and a lot of terse answers a question usually yields a couple of sentences in response rephrasing it gets you a few more words his manner isn t in any way surly rude or difficult i can t work out whether he s incredibly shy a bit diffident or just really doesn t like talking about himself ironically when trying to explain how he makes music he occasionally sounds not unlike the sampled voice you hear at the end of seesaw a track from his album i just … the world just … it stammers before lapsing into silence you do find yourself wondering how someone apparently so introverted gets on in the studio with big-name r b stars it s hard really he says hip-hop in particular is really difficult because you have to smoke a lot of weed while you re doing it i mean i m happy to say no but at the same time you feel like a nerd weed doesn t help me at all it just makes me fall asleep or want to be sick it s like being a producer for hire you meet a lot of people consider everybody s opinion i ve learned a lot. a pause what have you learned mostly that i like working on my own but it s good to push myself. he says he only made a solo album because it would force him to finish a load of tracks he had lying around some dating back six years – i can make something for a long time and just not come up with an ending it s finishing things that i don t enjoy – but in colour is far far better than that suggests smith is exceptionally good at what you might call dancefloor melancholy something you find a lot on old disco and early house records an odd ineffable sense of yearning amid the euphoria a nod to the fact that the elation of dancing in a club is a transient thing and the real world still waits outside the tracks with lyrics are filled with people temporarily lost in front of the big speakers subsumed by music you want to change your colours just for the night with no word of it following you home he says as his bandmate oliver sim puts it on stranger in a room from the album smith says he works best when he s feeling miserable well i don t need to be but i find that it helps it s not like i force myself to think of sad things but … it s more that i make music because it makes me happy. so if the music you re making lifts your mood it s an indication that it is a success yeah that s it. in fairness smith is a positive chatterbox compared to the first time i met him in 2010 in the company of his bandmates in my memory smith didn t utter a sound for two hours but checking the recording that s not the case at one juncture he yawned and muttered something about drum machines the xx were barely out of their teens and seemed a bit dazed by the success of their debut album which was critically lauded already on its way to going platinum and winning the mercury prize smith had produced it by accident – they d tried working with other producers including diplo but ended up coming back to his original recordings – and he was already being hailed as a visionary figure by his label boss at xl recordings richard russell i found him really inspiring as a beatmaker in quite a specific way says russell he was playing the mpc – which is a piece of studio equipment you re supposed to use for recording and sequencing – as an instrument that idea sort of blew my mind that you could play something live and still have the sounds i love the sample sounds i started doing it myself straight away on bobby womack s album on the stuff i was doing with damon albarn i didn t realise you weren t supposed to do that with it shrugs smith i still don t know how to use one properly. smith began djing aged 15 playing jazz and soul in a bar in camden and picking up dance tracks after hearing them on skate videos – the american ones are all punk but the english skate videos were quite tasteful a lot of hip-hop and electronica – but his style changed after a visit to the legendary dubstep night fwd » at east london s plastic people before that i wasn t really old enough to go to clubs and like actually feel it so i didn t really understand it i used to think house music was just boring then i went to fwd » and the amount of bass that they had … it had a kind of physical effect that made me want to make it on a faster tempo. he began djing alongside mount kimbie james blake and joy orbison all artists who would make their mark on the post-dubstep dance scene – although at first smith says he didn t feel like i was part of it because i was in an indie band he began producing low-key remixes for jack peñate and florence and the machine but the real breakthrough came when russell asked him to remix gil scott-heron s final album i m new here in its entirety he turned in a startling reinvention that marooned scott-heron s voice over heaving bass and washes of electronic noise its 21st-century sound flecked with samples from 60s and 70s soul i think i had an inkling that jamie was part of the same thing i see myself as says russell a bit of a continuum of pirate radio-influenced music russell began his career as a pirate radio dj before recording and remixing rave tracks under the names kicks like a mule and the valentine boys and i realised i was kind of in an interesting position because gil was 60-odd i was in my late 30s and jamie was just hitting 20 so there were these three very different stages of life i felt like between the three of us something interesting would come out of it. smith released a slew of acclaimed singles under his own name including the remarkable all under one roof raving a strange hypnotic confection of sparse percussion steel drums and snatches of dialogue from early-90s ravers taken from mark leckey s short film fiorucci made me hardcore there s a kind of sequel to it on in colour s opening track gosh a warped take on an old hardcore rhythm topped with a gorgeous wistful melody – the latter a homage to orbital s heartbreaking 1991 end-of-the-night anthem belfast the samples of mcs from radio 1 s mid-90s one in the jungle show are enough to make dance music fans of a certain age dewy-eyed a toddler when belfast was released smith says he s not obsessed with the past i just like the lineage and the heritage and the fact that british dance music is still progressing i m from london i love london and i wouldn t know how else to show that love in musical terms there s something about british stuff that s a bit faster a bit harder-hitting just tough. aside from his djing career and the f orthcoming third album from the xx he s scoring a ballet for the manchester international festival based on jonathan safran foer s experimental book tree of codes the music s less concise than on my album. and there s talk of performing some of in colour live at least for a tv show – the prospect of which doesn t seem to fill him with delight i m dreading it he says i have to be in front for one thing and then i have to orchestrate a whole band of people i don t know – as well as ollie and romy if they re up for it – which i ve never done again it s a good thing to do because it ll be a learning experience. he doesn t look convinced we head around the corner to the bombed-out church he s a fantastic dj unafraid to take risks – midway through the set he puts on the completely beatless stranger in a room – maintaining a frenzied atmosphere without playing anything obvious he stands half-hidden in dry ice rarely looking up from the turntables sometimes he turns around to pull another record out of his box – he s playing vinyl – and with his back to the audience dances on his own he looks like a character in one of in colour s songs momentarily lost subsumed by the music the stax/volt revue volume 1 live in london by various artists 1967 it was one of my parents records they were big soul and folk fans they liked fairport convention i just remember the cover black with loads of different pictures of people onstage it wasn t that that appealed to me though – it was the music otis redding sam and dave i listened to it over and over again the world is a ghetto special us disco mix by war 1979 it s nine minutes long or something four really long solos a harmonica solo in the middle this really driving disco beat it just works it s not so much influential as something i like – it doesn t get boring no matter how many times i listen to it i play it out a lot it s got to the stage where i try not to but it s very tempting dummy by portishead 1994 i first heard it when i was 11 probably one of the tracks wandering star was on this skate video i liked i bought the album just after that i think it was the production that appealed to me obviously i didn t know about how to produce or anything then i didn t even know what a computer program that made music looked like but every bit of it sounds so satisfying it s obvious they spent a lot of much time on it double figure by plaid 2001 for years i always pronounced their name played – i never met anyone else who knew them or what to call them played makes more sense actually it s like techno but not techno they use really odd chord progressions they change keys from minor to major in the middle of a riff which is kind of unsettling i d just never heard anything that was like that there is love in you by four tet 2010 it was when kieran hebden started making stuff with a 4/4 rhythm to it i d listened to him a lot before but this … it came out when i met my girlfriend we listened to it over and over so that s quite a special album it was before i really knew him we re friends now he has an amazing record collection i mean his dad is a jazz record collector so he had an in but still he always says he forgets that he made this album jamie xx s debut solo album in colour is out on 1 june in the coming year and the results will define the country for a generation these are perilous times over the last three years much of what the guardian holds dear has been threatened – democracy civility truth this us administration is establishing new norms of behaviour anger and cruelty disfigure public discourse and lying is commonplace truth is being chased away but with your help we can continue to put it center stage it will be defining year and we re asking for your help as we prepare for 2020 rampant disinformation partisan news sources and social media s tsunami of fake news is no basis on which to inform the american public in 2020 the need for a robust independent press has never been greater and with your help we can continue to provide fact-based reporting that offers public scrutiny and oversight we are also committed to keeping our journalism open and accessible to everyone and with your help we can keep it that way. america is at a tipping point finely balanced between truth and lies hope and hate civility and nastiness many vital aspects of american public life are in play – the supreme court abortion rights climate policy wealth inequality big tech and much more the stakes could hardly be higher as that choice nears the guardian as it has done for 200 years and with your continued support will continue to argue for the values we hold dear – facts science diversity equality and fairness. – us editor john mulholland on the occasion of its 100th birthday in 1921 the editor of the guardian said perhaps the chief virtue of a newspaper is its independence it should have a soul of its own. that is more true than ever freed from the influence of an owner or shareholders the guardian s robust independence is our unique driving force and guiding principle we also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the guardian in 2019 you provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do we hope to surpass our goal by early january every contribution big or small will help us reach it make a year-end gift from as little as 1 thank you sign in or create your guardian account to join the discussion nice to see somebody from that electronica/post dubstep wave given exposure here on the guardian he covers a wide spectrum of sounds and that means that some of it can be discarded quickly however some of his output is absolutely brilliant and in particular his work with gil scott-heron is beautiful it s nice that he and similarly joy orbison who is mentioned above managed to keep themselves well grounded and slide under the radar slightly their output remains and unrushed and thoughtful one of my favourite artists great article really enjoyed it now i m trying to think what was the early 90s kicks like a mule raver track i used to love .. gon na bug me all day your names not down you re not coming in got it wow memories kerri chandler soundtracked the kicks of the 90 s tune as alexis slant in this interview is dwelling on jamie s ability as a dj rather than as a producer i m going to have to take issue he s a fantastic dj ok alexis i understand nowadays that the term dj has become so debased and abused especially by your ilk as to be almost meaningless but he s not the sort of dj you want in a club or party he s a decent selector with an extensive collection so he could dj on radio or at art/fashion/corporate events but he can t build or sustain energy on a dancefloor very well the boiler room vid embedded above shows this extremely talented producer though can t fault that aspect of his musical skillset in anyway agreed turn to ben ufo if you want somebody with a similar expansive knowledge of records merged with the ability to keep a dancefloor bubbling along from someone who absolutely adores this guy this comment is perfect/completely accurate i seen him live earlier this year and i had an amazing time but his actual djing and mixing ability was not really up there with others that i have seen but his selection was superb and the atmosphere that he built from his set was mind-blowing up there with bonobo in my opinion or joy orbison if you can catch him outstanding dj he s doen some top tunes far nearer and his penate and faltydl remixes are personal favourites but i can t say he s been too good when i ve seen him dj one friend put it as like the sound of two skeletons having sex on a tin roof using metal bins for condoms in the middle of a hailstorm that sounds pretty good tbf i have heard him though nowt great but competent enough fantastic album always quite liked that boiler room set the tracklist isnt half as smug and pretentious as most of them anyone read the boomkat review of the album yikes the album is good though desperate to see him dj big fan i saw him djing at fabric maybe 8/9 years ago and it was one of the worst sets i ve ever heard by a dj displaying a lack of even the most basic mixing/beatmatching skills and eliciting boos from the main room crowd from previous comments it doesn t sound as if he s improved much here s the boomkat review it s a great piece of writing the guradian should employ them http //boomkat.com/vinyl/1251070-jamie-xx-in-colour-deluxe-vinyl-edition so so good very talented man i absolutely love his production work have to agree with his choice of fourtet album too it is beautiful how *do* you pronounce plaid though i m with jamie on this how *do* you pronounce plaid though
