Google Maps script Error for Internet Explorer - Stack Overflow                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 I coded a Javascript that initializes a Google Map. The code works perfectly fine while using Firefox browser. I already tried Firebug to find bugs. Firebug says the code is fine. However, the exact same code does not work if I want to run the script in the  Internet Explorer . So I guess it must be an issue with the IE. The script breaks whenever I want to interact with the fusion table by clicking on the  KML layers  or highlighting certain regions by activating a radio button. Here is my initialize function: Here is my header: Thanks a lot in advance :) For google maps support in IE need to add  this script  < script src="https://cdn.polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js" > < /script > in your index file, It will work perfectly.
