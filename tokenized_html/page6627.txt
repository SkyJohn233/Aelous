their favorite songs by cohen here are the results xa0 few xa0 people were paying attention to leonard cohen by 1988 the miraculous resurrection of hallelujah was still years away and to many he seemed like an aging 1960s folk singer destined to play clubs for the rest of his life but then he released i m your man a brilliant album full of synthpop songs about everything from neo-nazi s to the art of songwriting to whatever the hell jazz police is about the title track is a profoundly horny song of pure lust. and if you want a doctor cohen sings. i ll examine every inch of you. he s played it at virtually every concert he s done since 1988 and it never fails to make the ladies in the audience coo xa0 leonard cohen has written a ridiculous amount of great lines over his long career but few can compare to forget your perfect offering/there is a crack in everything/that s how xa0 the light gets in. it s the key line on anthem one of the standout tracks from his 1992 disc

said i ve seen the future of rock and roll and it is not leonard cohen from there he couldn t do much else but read the lines to his 1988 classic tower of song. the crowd laughed at lines like i ache in the places where i used to play but they slowly realized he was delivering a profound statement about his life s work and hushed up xa0 back in may of 1988 leonard cohen decided to push heart with no companion towards the end of the night and open up his show xa0 with dance me to the end of love. he must have really thought it was a good move because as far as we can tell it s opened up every single concert he s done ever since x2014 and we re talking well north of 400 consecutive shows the 1984 song was written on a dinky casio synthesizer he found xa0 in a tourist shop in times square as author sylvie simmons tells it in her incredible cohen biography i m your man the life of leonard cohen the machine didn t even have an output jack cohen insisted they find a way to make it work in the studio and the result is a tune that sends chills down the spine of many cohen fans because they know it means a magical night of music is just beginning xa0 long before he released a single note of music leonard cohen encountered xa0 marianne ihlen a beautiful norwegian woman that xa0 would serve as his lover and muse xa0 for many years she was married xa0 to writer xa0 axel jensen when they met and she d later have his child but the attraction between xa0 ihlen and cohen was intense and they eventually they found room in their lives for each other she inspired many of his most passionate love songs off his early albums including so long marianne. he spent months trying to get it just right and the end result kicks off side two of his 1967 debut lp songs of leonard cohen xa0 leonard cohen was going through a bout of depression while living on the greek island of hydra when he noticed a bird sitting by himself on a telephone wire he began writing a poem comparing himself to the lonely bird but it would be a long time before he turned it into a song he was happy with during the 1968 songs from a xa0 room sessions in nashville cohen ran through the song over and over until he got so frustrated that he sent most of the musicians home and gave up days before the final session he simply walked up to the microphone and spontaneously found a whole new way to approach the work it became one of his most beloved songs and a staple of his live show for decades xa0 everybody knows must be the most pessimistic song in cohen s vast catalog here are things that everybody supposedly knows the dice are loaded the boat is leaking the captain lied the poor stay poor the rich get rich the plague is coming and moving fast it s quite the bummer but somehow packaged all together you get the feeling we re going to survive this parade of horrors together over the years it s been covered by everyone from don henley to concrete blonde to rufus wainwright xa0 sometime in the early 1970s a thief stole leonard cohen s old raincoat from marianne ihlen s new york apartment god only know what happened to it but the thief almost certainly had no idea he was stealing an object that belongs in the rock and roll hall of fame if not the smithsonian it was that very coat that inspired cohen to write one of his most beloved and mysterious songs it s written in the form of a letter possibly to the narrator s brother who stole his lover jane. famous blue raincoat xa0 has captivated listeners ever since it first appeared on 1971 s songs of love and hate xa0 though cohen admits he s not happy with the lyrics. it was a song i ve never been satisfied with he said in 1994. it s not that i ve resisted an impressionistic approach to songwriting but i ve never felt that this one that i really nailed the lyric i m ready to concede something to the mystery but secretly i ve always felt that there was something about the song that was unclear. xa0 there was a real suzanne contrary to what the song implies she never had sex with leonard cohen the stunningly gorgeous xa0 suzanne verdal did xa0 however serve tea and oranges when he visited her and her boyfriend renowned canadian sculptor xa0 armand vaillancourt at their home in montreal xa0 cohen was forced as the song says to touch her perfect body with his mind. the song began as a poem and was first recorded by judy collins in 1966 cohen cut the song himself the following year it s the first track xa0 on his debut record kicking off one of the most incredible careers in music history xa0 the year 1984 was a pretty amazing time for pop music with new releases by prince bruce springsteen madonna and van halen filling the airwaves amidst all that greatness came leonard cohen s various positions which xa0 landed with a thud towards the end of the year interest in cohen was so low that columbia initially refused to even release it figuring it wouldn t be worth the effort of printing copies and sending them to stores virtually nobody paid attention to a little song called hallelujah that kicked off the second side of the lp cohen however knew he had something special he spent an unusually long time on the lyrics obsessing over every word and going through 80 different drafts when the velvet underground s john cale asked him to send over the lyrics so he could cover it he received a 15-page fax full of discarded verses cale cobbled together a new version of the song which he recorded on the piano it was that version that jeff buckley covered on his 1994 lp grace and xa0 slowly the song became an absolute sensation covered so many times that adam sandler spoofed the practice xa0 at the 12/12/12 charity show at xa0 madison square garden xa0 by now people that have never even heard the name leonard cohen know hallelujah. it s become a modern-day hymn performed everywhere from street corners to american idol xa0 even people that feel they could go the rest of their lives
