cleaners greene s cleaners the venerable dry-cleaning company in the napa valley celebrates its centennial anniversary in april marking a century of serving napa residents it s a great place said customer ben bezayiff who has been bringing his dry-cleaning to greene s for years it s their professionalism that keeps me coming back it is their welcoming demeanor and their quality. greene s began when the late george greene opened his doors in 1919 greene sold the store to glenn and helen paulsen in 1957 the storefront was moved to jefferson street during their ownership the paulsens retired in 1979 and sold the business to peter and terry smith during their ownership the smiths daughter laurie worked at their jefferson street shop she learned the business from the ground up this is significant because when the smiths were ready to retire they approached laurie and her husband alonso corona and asked the couple to buy them out the coronas did and have been working since to bring this hundred-year-old business firmly into the 21st century alonso is president and ceo of greene s cleaners inc. and laurie is cfo and in charge of accounting early 20th century napa when greene opened his dry-cleaning doors in the early 20th century napa was a rough-and-tumble frontier town the largest industrial companies were tanning factories that produced hides and tallow napa s second largest business back then was wheat processing both were dirty businesses which helped create the need for a commercial cleaner during this time farmers and factory workers would need to have their jeans belts boots and saddles cleaned victorian era men dressed in suits women wore ruffled dresses all were difficult to clean at home with just an iron so the population started to turn to commercial cleaners fast-forward 100 years and greene s cleaners prides itself on having close ties to the past as well as the present during the 2017 wildfires laurie said greene s partnered with napastrong and cleaned more than 5,000 pounds of donated items. black friday started early save 90 for 20 weeks cancel anytime unlimited articles on napavalleyregister.com with no surveys includes

specializes in guest room linens event linens and large textiles such as drapes and rugs as well as employee uniforms greene s offers free pick-up and delivery wedding gown cleaning and preservation alterations leather cleaning area rug cleaning and smoke damage and fire restoration cleaning the decision to expand into sonoma was made in large part because how successful the addition of full-time pickup and delivery services in napa county to homes offices and businesses between st. helena and american canyon has been said alonso it was really not that much of a difference to add sonoma
