is closed to further replies please be aware that the content of this thread may be outdated and no longer applicable by duxe october 21 2018 in general discussion open to all i 'm writing this up for myself and anyone that wants a one stop shop for the food information i 've seen crockpot recipes somewhere but i have n't seen everything food together in one area so here goes also by all means correct me or tell me to add stuff that i miss this is n't down to the wire perfection in the first place because i could n't be bothered to test out some stuff say which filler goes with every crockpot dish but let 's be real if sticks work are we really going to use another filler or spoilage time and i do n't know things like priority values since i did n't jump into the code here 's all the stand alone new items i think thanks magic water has 300+ for the hunger value because i do n't know what the actual value is it full heals wolfgang 's hunger and there is no character with a higher value soooo anyone wan na jump in the code for me so i can remove the question mark and then the ten new crockpot recipes currently in the beta i do n't know the actual code recipes i did my best testing em out tea iced tea asparagus soup spicy veg stinger nettle rolls snake bone soup hard shell tacos steamed ham sandwich feijoada gummy cake and an additional five unused to my knowledge food images in the code courtesy watermelen671 for the above images as well bubble tea french onion soup lotus chips slaw poi thanks fuffledbeequeen for the names if you are a newer player and do n't know how food values work or what priorities are i suggest reading this page from the do n't starve wiki http //dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/crock_pot i heard tea iced and hot increases your movement speed and tea turns into iced tea when fully spoiled i heard tea iced and hot increases your movement speed and tea turns into iced tea when fully spoiled yes but not great as coffee boost about half i heard tea iced and hot increases your movement speed and tea turns into iced tea when fully spoiled tea coffee speed boost/2 iced tea coffee speed boost/3 yes tea turns into iced tea upon spoilage nettle roll can be made with even monster meat but i dare not tried asparagus 'the absolute nettle roll can be made with even monster meat but i dare not tried asparagus 'the absolute nettle roll has a priority of 0 while asparagus soup has a priority of 10 so asparagus would kill your nettles immidiently magic water has 300+ for the hunger value because i do n't know what the actual value is it full heals wolfgang 's hunger and there is no character with a higher value soooo anyone wan na jump in the code for me so i can remove the question mark i believe it 's 450 hunger thanks for the replies and info i 've updated the initial post i forgot the speed boost from tea when i wrote the original post thanks for the reminder i do n't think it 's necessary for me to bother with adding any priority information to this set but i guess i would if someone gave me the priorities for all 10 recipes and same goes for spoilage time the tea turning into iced tea when it spoils has got to be a bug thanks for the replies and info i 've updated the initial post i do n't think it 's necessary for me to bother with adding any priority information to this set but i guess i would if someone gave me the priorities for all 10 recipes and same goes for spoilage time the tea turning into iced tea when it spoils has got to be a bug no it just turns cold its intentional no it just turns cold its intentional eh i mean i can accept it if it really is but i guess this is one of those things that just does n't make sense logically a real tea could n't cool past room temp and magically have ice form plus also then whats the point of there being a separate recipe bubble tea and poi 3 maybe there 'll be poke and pig-free spam eh i mean i can accept it if it really is but i guess this is one of those things that just does n't make sense logically a real tea could n't cool past room temp and magically have ice form plus also then whats the point of there being a separate recipe it 's specifically set to spoil into icetea in the code so it 's at the very least not a bug priority perish time special stuffs sani tea 25 1 day counts as veg turns into ice tea half the efficiency and duration of the coffee speed buff ice tea 30 6 days counts as veggie one third the efficiency and duration of the coffee speed buff asparagus soup 10 15 days counts as veggie spicy veg stinger 15 15 days counts as veggie nettle rolls 0 6 days counts as veggie 720 units of anti histamine idk what that is but it 's hayfever preventing snake bone soup 20 10 days counts as meat duh hard shell tacos 1 15 days counts as veggie steamed ham 5 6 days counts as meat duh feijo-bug stuff 30 8 days counts as meat gummy jello 1 20 days counts as meat the other 5 foods are n't implemented in the files yet thanks for the helpful meals info everyone i 've used cooked seed pods to cure hay fever plenty of times not sure of the timer though or if uncooked works as well thanks for the helpful meals info everyone i 've used cooked seed pods to cure hay fever plenty of times not sure of the timer though or if uncooked works as well oh i did n't realize those worked interesting i 've gone ahead and looked into it and here 's what i found from lowest to highest uncooked seed pod value of 60 cooked seed pod value of 120 nettle value of 200 nettle rolls value of 720 new helpful information is always such a tasty find for me i also did n't know seed pods work for that i do wish there was a super compiled list of tips to help the newer players on here but also to help me when the game goes live and i inevitably forget some of the useful tips scattered throughout the forum maybe i 'll make one if i have time thanks again fuffled and zeklo i 'll add those up to the top post powered by
