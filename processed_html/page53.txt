Fruits and local snacks were refilled daily which was thoughtful. Many daybeds around the pool by the sea allow guests to relax. Spice restaurant offers good varieties of breakfast and relaxing dining environment. Clean everywhere in the hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful. When we checked in we were not pleased by the view and the Duty Manager A. Koperumdevi helped us changed the room and resolved the problem. We were very pleased about the arrangement and big credit to her prompt handling and excellent service. Nevertheless, we received a letter from Devi, the Duty Manager at night apologize for the inconvenience caused and a box if chocolate was presented to us.
