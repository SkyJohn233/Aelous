FUE Training with Dr. Cole in Taiwan : Forhair Clinic Taiwan hosted its first Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) hair restoration conference earlier this week. Dr. Cole, a leader and innovator in the field, was included in a group of four physicians who spoke to attendees about the FUE method. The following day, Dr. Cole visited three clinics that purchased the Powered Cole Isolation Device (PCID) from Cole Instruments. Several of the surgeons had previously been using older technology like the Neograft to perform their FUE procedures; however, they have transitioned to the PCID due to its improved success with patients. Dr. Huang Zhongli commented that the lower transection rate of hair follicles is a key advantage of this device. He also noted that FUE does not result in any linear scarring for the patient. While the cost of this procedure is higher for patients, the results speak for themselves.
