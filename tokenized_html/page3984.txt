why is this bold text not respecting css vertical-align middle stack overflow by using our site you acknowledge that you have read and understand our cookie policy privacy policy and our terms of service i have a bunch of text and images in a line and i want to align vertically it all seems to work except i just added some bold text and the bold text seems to show up a little lower than the regular text here is a screenshot here is a simpliried view of my html here is my css if i remove the bold tag it seems to line up correctly i have a bunch of text and images in a line so when you use .midalign it applies to all the elements so the face is you do n't need to apply that property to all elements you need that for img only so use and it will solve the issue demo also when you use the selector it impacts the performance you are using that for no good reason for this particular case i will explain you why that happened b and img both are inline elements so when you apply vertical-align middle it aligns the element to the baseline so say we have an img and a b tag so b will be vertically aligned middle considering the entire height of an element see this so when you are using middle as the value it 's middle but to the entire element height and not just your text demo so technically your b tag was aligned middle vertically but it 's just that you do n't have to align that so use specific element selector instead of a generalized selector the problem is that the .midalign only applies to the b element just removing the solves the problem click here to upload your image max 2 mib cancel and add another image you can also provide a link from the web log in by clicking post your answer you agree to our terms of service privacy policy and cookie policy 2019 stack exchange inc
