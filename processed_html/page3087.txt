About Us | The Shirelles We are a group of women in our 50s who had the opportunity to grow up listening to the sound of The Shirelles. Theirs was a sweet melody that made people want to fall in love. They also spoke of real-life situations that every boy, girl or couple might experience in their lives. We created this site in order to ensure that the legacy of The Shirelles lives on for years to come. We also wanted to create a special fan page where fans of The Shirelles can find each other and reminisce about the sweet 60s and 70s. We intend to ensure that the legacy of The Shirelles lives on. The only way that this can happen is by bringing together all of their fans in a central place where they can remember the sweet melodies that these girls gave to us in the 60s. We also want to bring back the memories of the early 60s, the period when The Shirelles’ songs were commonplace on all major radio stations. The 60s With The Shirelles We also want to cover the things that many people never knew about The Shirelles and their hit songs. By doing so, we hope that everyone will come to appreciate the work of The Shirelles even more, and perhaps convert more people to love the sound of this amazing quartet.
