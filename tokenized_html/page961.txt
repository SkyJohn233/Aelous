comedian jim gaffigan shares how to survive holiday political debates npr after a contentious election families around the country are gathering for thanksgiving and figuring out how to get along politically npr 's kelly mcevers talks to comedian jim gaffigan who has a big family of his own about how to get through the holiday unscathed kelly mcevers host whether you 're counting votes counting your blessings or counting olives for your martini tomorrow is a big day soundbite of album beyond the pale jim gaffigan thanksgiving you know thanksgiving it 's like we did n't even try to come up with a tradition the tradition is we overeat laughter gaffigan hey how about at thanksgiving we just eat a lot laughter gaffigan we do that every day laughter gaffigan oh what if we eat a lot with people that annoy the hell out of us laughter gaffigan oh he 's anti-family mcevers that 's jim gaffigan from beyond the pale and since he is not anti-family we 've asked him to help us help ourselves this thanksgiving when we will not only be mixing in-laws and cocktails but also politics jim gaffigan welcome to the show gaffigan thank you for having me i think this is a unique thanksgiving right mcevers yeah gaffigan this is mcevers you think gaffigan the timing of thanksgiving it seems like you know i think abraham lincoln started the official date and it now it seems like a cruel joke it 's like ok here 's the idea we 'll have an incredibly divisive election mcevers laughter gaffigan and then we 'll have a couple weeks to stew on it and then we 'll make everyone eat turkey mcevers with people they have n't seen since last year gaffigan right and so there 's something about it that 's funny but i think that maybe i 'm being an optimist i think it 's almost fortunate that this is happening how about that for positivity mcevers laughter oh really why gaffigan i mean look i 'm you know i 'm kind of an irish catholic guy so like you know mcevers kind of gaffigan my family people you know if you have an argument with someone you 're just kind of like you 're like all right i 'm not talking to them the rest of my lives you know whereas with thanksgiving you 're forced to put in this situation and i think it 's a positive scenario where you know maybe somebody voted a different way but you can remember oh yeah that 's right they took me to the state fair when i was eight so we can humanize some of these issues that divide us mcevers what are your plans for thanksgiving gaffigan my wife has decided to cook which on appearance it seems like a really bad idea because we have five young children mcevers right gaffigan and essentially thanksgiving is the most complicated meal you can think of every night dinner is just pasta it 's just different shapes of pasta mcevers laughter gaffigan that 's so like now the thanksgiving meal is just so unnecessarily difficult i mean even mashed potatoes it 's like the most difficult kind of you know medieval idea all right instead of just cooking them why do n't you spend like eight hours peeling them and then we 'll have to mash them up it feels like prison labor really mcevers laughter gaffigan making mashed potatoes so mcevers for that many people but also like i would imagine that many people with like a bunch of like differing demands like i want my mashed potatoes cold and i want my potatoes sliced like that 's what it sounds like at my house gaffigan yeah well kids the thanksgiving dishes even the side dishes i think people can forget to a little kid candied yams are not something they 've even heard of and laughter they 're not interested in having something mcevers laughter gaffigan for instance like stuffing that it 's like some bread dish that was cooked inside of a carcass of an animal like it 's for a little kid mcevers it 's like can we just have chicken fingers like what 's the problem laughter gaffigan yeah it 's a big leap yeah mcevers i want to talk about how we can deal with the you know the elephant in the room like politics want to start with a note from annalee oakley who sent a photograph of a sign that her daughter drew she hung it on the door the day of her 10th birthday party and it 's this pink sign that says no politicking and like in the o of the no is like this like angry sad face gaffigan yeah mcevers and annalee writes you know by the way the party was wonderful she had an awesome conflict-free celebration they think they 'll do the same for thanksgiving so i mean what do you think like lay the responsibility on the kids to keep the peace do you think that 's a good tactic gaffigan i you know look i 've built a career on food as medicine so i think it 's just consume food i mean alcohol never a good idea laughter you know what i mean mcevers laughter you 're irish what are you talking about gaffigan i might have a disagreement with this guy adding booze probably not going to help solve it mcevers ok. do you think that the adults are going to behave better or worse with kids around gaffigan it 's interesting you say that because my eldest children are 10 and 12 and they are the most opinionated on this presidential election but i like people with different opinions i think it 'll be fun it 's a little bit like an agatha christie situation you do n't know like you might think it 's going to be grandma but you know what mcevers laughter gaffigan it might be your niece you 're like well wow you 're the crazy one mcevers laughter gaffigan i mean laughter you know mcevers you 're the one trying to stab me under the table gaffigan right you 're mad because i 'm not mad enough you know mcevers laughter so just keep eating just eat your way through gaffigan yeah just keep eating mcevers jim
