Mr. Disgusting ' s Top 10 Horror Films of 2015! - Bloody Disgusting by Earlier this year it looked as if Rodney Ascher s docu-horror  The Nightmare  was a shoe-in for best of 2015, but eventually was surpassed by a glutton of great films (see below). While  The Nightmare , the next doc from the filmmaker behind  Room 237 , isn t as scary as people were boasting, it s pretty chilling. The film explores the phenomenon of â€˜Sleep Paralysisâ€™ through the eyes of eight very different people, and shares reenactments of their accounts.  While thereâ€™s a lot of scary stories told throughout, one really stuck with me, one that I personally found fucking terrifying. In a scene, a young man recounting his first experience with Sleep Paralysis. Now, while most people have isolated incidents, his was passed on from his girlfriend. Yes, just the notion that his girlfriend was experiencing Sleep Paralysis was enough to trigger it within himself. That is scary as fuck. Why? Ask yourself this: could a viewing of  The Nightmare  be infectious? Could the very notion of sleep paralysis cause a viewer to experience it? Watch at your own risk. Pages:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  9  10 11 12 Watched 4 on this list. Final Girls, WWDITS  &  It Follows were great. Looking forward to some of the others (The Visit, Deathgasm, Turbo Kid, Christmas Horror Story). Deathgasm  &  Turbo Kid were great. Christmas horror Story was good. One segment just didn t work for me. Still need to see the Visit. I have a feeling I ll end up blind buying all of those. Usually do pretty well in that category  &  they all look fun. Glad to see It Follows at #1, it s deserved. Haven t seen February (not sure if it is released yet) but What We Do in the Shadows is easily my #2! I need to watch February NOW! Since the first trailer I m drooling all over this but I don t think it will ever be released in my country really want to watch The Final Girls and February. It Follows is definitely on my Top 10 Films of 2015 (not just Horror) Not to hype it up, bu The Final Girls was incredibly amazing, IMO ðŸ™‚ I couldn t have said it better myself. The Final Girls was, to me  a FUCKING masterpiece. I absolutely loved it. damn you  in a good way ðŸ™‚ Thought it was extremely meh myself  to each their own. Yes-  IMO  means  In My Opinion Meow LOL! Fair enough. I thought is was totally and absolutely without a doubt 100 percent no questions asked mildly tolerable. Extremely Meh, is my favorite comment on BG in 2015. wwdits is perhaps my film of the year  horror or otherwise. Would Scouts Guide to a Zombie Apocalypse count on this list? It should because THAT movie was a total badass fun movie. I absolutely loved that one too. That gif from Deathgasm is everything. Yes. Yes it is. yeah, my buddies mom is pissed. she s been lookin  for that thing all week. real uptight this week. I m trying to figure out how A Christmas Horror Story made your list. What about Goodnight Mommy, Bone Tomahawk,  &  We Are Still Here? Also If you include February (a film that played at festivals only) I take it you didn t see The Witch, He Never Died or Before I Wake. That s exactly what I was thinking and two of those three films sprang to mind, GM and BT. How could I forget WESH. The other one that came to mind not included on the list is The Boy. But I guess everything is subjective and depends on the person s taste. However, the only film I d agree with and would probably leave in it s place, is It Follows. Had to upvote you just for sounding like a reasonably intelligent person. Can t wait to see Bone Tomahawk. Bone Tomahawk was awesome. Finally saw it! It was great! It s my favorite of the year.  I agree with all but Goodnight Mommy. I was severely disappointed there. horrible list The visit and nightmare???? Yeah I don t agree with this list But To each their own Definitely It Follows on the top spot for me as well. People didn t get behind Green Inferno, I think, because Roth just does the same film over and over. He has nothing to say. Ohhhh snap!!!!! Eh, better than your godawful list last year.  I can t hate too much but I will anyways (cuz it s fun!):   Green Inferno was barely even tolerable. The Visit was alright but I d be hard pressed to make it a top 10. I d call it a top 9 list if it happened to be 10th best :-P. Turbo Kid, while utter fuckin awesomeness and my favorite overall movie of the year, is hard to call a horror movie in any way (not as egregious as your picking of Raid 2 last year though). The Final Girls was wholly mediocre and extremely disappointing. A Christmas Horror Story yet no Krampus? (both would make mine, but Krampus was better). The Nightmare was absolute atrocious garbage and one of the worsts of the year. And   It Follows is just overrated.   It d still make my list, but there were better.  Whatever though, I m ok with that one. Me, replacing the 4 (5) that shouldn t be there:  The Hallow, Krampus, We Are Still Here, Bone Tomahawk, and honorable mention to Crimson Peak (very disappointing that it wasn t something more, but still good for what it was). Notice they re all indie-esque movies. Mr. D hates the big budget movies. Right? No Hallow? Great movie with a great performance by Bojana! Well now don t go too far with that    It was far too dumb (cabinet baby) and cliche to be  great . Was kinda stretching for a 10th pick honestly.   On second thought I should take my own advice and make it a top 9  :-). Great creatures and effects though.  It follows won t even be in my top 10. That film was such garbage, so inconsistent and not even scary. I ve taken trips to the bathroom that were filled with more tension and horror than that movie were! Then your opinion is unworthy of acknowledgement. Im interested in these bathroom trips. Please, do tell us more. not bad of a list. don t care to see xmas story or turbo tho but everyone has diff tastes Highly recommend Christmas Horror Story   I expected it to be cheap looking and just all around another crappy anthology film, I was 100% wrong. The film looks beautiful and every inch feels like Christmas. If you liked Trick  r Treat and its interwoven narratives, you will love this movie. Turbo Kid is pretty freakinh awesome as well Really? Bout to un-sub. What would be your list then? Probably a bunch of remakes and stupid found footage movies like  Creep I knew you were gonna put  It Follows  at #1. That movie was such trash. Seriously, I have never seen something so over-hyped in my life. I was utterly disappointed.  The Final Girls  was 10x better even without the blood and guts. The Final Girls had big balls for a PG-13 movie. I loved it, I enjoyed it  &  the song Betty Davis Eyes will never be the same to me anymore. I loved how they used it in the movie. Amazing + Awesome = Buy it  &  support this movie. I already bought 7 (so far) for friends  &  family for Christmas. People, it was THAT good!!!!! THE FINAL GIRLS over IT FOLLOWS? LOLLOLOLOLOL0OLOLOLOLOLOLOL You ve never seen something more over-hyped than a low-budget horror flick that made about $14m at the box office? I mean, I love The Force Awakens and all, but there are Star Wars branded oranges at my grocery store, so I think we have different definitions of  hype. The backlash to It Follows is so over-the-top, but that s what happens when any horror movie enjoys even a modicum of praise. When anyone comes anywhere close to their territory, horror fans cut the sleeves off their shirts and turn into total dudebros,  fuck that, wasn t scary! I m tough! There wasn t a single  scary  moment in that film. What are you going on about? The movie sucked.  The Babadook  was extremely hyped as well, and I m not afraid to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It Follows  did absolutely nothing for me. I m sorry if I ve crushed your hopes and dreams. It Follows? It Follows! that movie was crap. Especially when their big plan is to electrocute it after it had survived everything else thrown at it. Why the hell would that work? We get it. You think you re being  Trendy  by going against the grain. Exactly, the endgame plan is dumb and childish and the finale is supposed to reflect that. You kinda missed the point. Hostel didn t have a mean-spirited soul??? You gotta be fucking kidding me. It was pure nihilistic sadism. It was literally people paying to torture others for no other reason than pleasure.  &  the comeuppances were a joke. If that movie isn t mean-spirited, I don t know what is. Dude seriously.  All of Roth s films are the same. Snide and unimaginative. He creates a group of ugly Americans and they are punished. Rinse. Repeat. You see Knock Knock? Definitely different than Roth s previous work. Good to know. Sounds like there is the typical comeuppance aspect though that s represented in all his films.  There is. But this one is definitely different. If you go to see an Eli Roth movie, you should know if it s advertised as gory in any way, it s only for fans of Eli Roth s previous work. It s a simple recipe but hey, so is grilled cheese. Thanks to the tip man. I will check it out for sure then! Happy holidays! Right back at ya Hostel was more of an American Pie-esque horror film. Green Inferno and Hostel II were both far more mean than Hostel. Of course my horse? Nice list. Turbo Kid is so good. Honestly I enjoyed many of the horror films that came out this year. Can t wait to check out February . February was good but in my opinion it s not the best out of the 2016 releases that i ve seen. Seriously. I am so disappointed by some of the commenters here hating on It Follows. I get having criticisms on it but calling it  garbage  and the  worst film ever  is such a reach. Really shows you who the real horror fans are and who really has a future in the horror genre. I mean some are calling that Cabin in the Woods kiddy friendly wannabe movie  The Final Girls  the best of the year. Now THAT is sad. Who let s these people on this site? This is why I hate when a horror movie gets critical acclaim. People go in wanting to hate it so they can feel  unique  and  different  going against the grain acting like they are better than everyone else. Overall good list IMO. Final Girls is alright, but best of the year like some commenters are saying? No way. It s opinions. Everybody s got different tastes. I happen to think both movies were awesome. Me too! I love horror, but the posters here are always angry or just trying to out do each other. To be fair, that sounds like 99% of message boards. Lol true. Every once in awhile I have to remind myself some people have no life outside of the internet. When push comes to shove, I will watch and enjoy, to variable extent, all horror genre movies.  I like  em all, love some of them.  I m trying to turn over a new leaf and only bash Halloween III from now on. Lmfao! Halloween is my favorite movie! Hate Halloween 3 with a passion. I was so pissed when I first saw it. I was only 8 yrs old. The disappointment was real. Lol as a kid I was so horribly disgusted by that movie. Especially since Halloween is my absolute favorite. It is a reach, but I think BD posters  (as with on most public forums) are given to hyperbole. Their hate for It Follows makes me love it even more. Watched it about 5 times already. My condolences  Is this Mr. D under an alias? Another BD staffer? I find it amusing you re going after the posters in the comment boards when the author of the posts has gone out of his way to bash every film he didnt like, and would drive that point home until we got tired of seeing it. Only the guy writing the posts is allowed to bash a film? It follows was literally nothing. Almost nothing happened the entire film, there were little to no scares, the ambience and the soundtrack were the best thing about the film, Maika is a solid actress but was wasted on the film, was a great starting point for her career but the film itself lacked anything substantial, i get the point and the metaphors blah blah blah, but doesn t make it a great movie. it wasn t the absolute worst film ever made, this is true, but it is definitely one of them. Horror films rely too much on jump scares! What happened to atmosphere!? *It Follows comes out* The only it has going for it is the ambiance. I liked it too but . Who cares? Who cares if others hate it? Does it take away from your enjoyment? Probably not So . Who cares? Maika Monroe was great and the premise was interesting but It Follows was wildly overrated We Are Still Here was great, I thought. Yes it was. Definitely in my top 10. I m surprise Krampus is not on the list. I keep hearing good things about A Christmas Horror Story also Deathgasm looks like fun since aside of a horror fan i m also a heavy metal fan. Also consider watching The Nightmare and February oh It follows uh well I was so disappointed when I first saw it in theaters actually it has only one scene that creeped me out but mostly I attribute the success of the movie to 1. the hype 2. the music cause I have to say is a masterpiece and make the whole movie solid and added that disturbing effect, recently I watched it on netflix and realized it is a ok movie but definitely doesn t deserves the praises and the hype and the things said in here. And on a low-key note I still believe that has a message for teenagers  Don t fuck or you ll die  stay holy. It Follows is so overrated! The movie isn t bad or good, It s a normal movie! I think they can do a prequel better and scarier. I didn t like It Follows the first time I saw it. I liked it more when I saw it the second and third time.  Now it s one of my favorite movies. It s frustrating because it could have been a masterpiece. There were some miss opportunities in it. I m dying to see  February . But I disagree on  The nightmare , while I enjoyed the film, it gets too repetitive. Maybe  We are still here  was a better choice. Sorry but this list was a piece of crap. I LOVED The Final Girls and you disliking it for lack of violence is incredibly stupid. It s PG13 for one. Two how can you dislike this film when there s The Ring that has like 3 to 4 deaths overall? Maybe cuz the ring was an actual horror film My top 5 movies are: 1- Crimson Peak This is more a thriller with fantasy elements than a horror movie but it was one of the best movies of the year, I think it deserves some nomitations for the Oscars. 2- Green Inferno I don t like Eli Roth, but Green Inferno is a good movie! I m so excited about the sequel. 3- The Visit This movie is the proof that some  PG-13  movies can be good and scary! I enjoyed a lot. 4- The Final Girls Okay, It s not a masterpiece but it s movie with a curious concept! I liked, but would need the  R  to be better. 5- Kristy I enjoyed a lot! The story is cliche but the action never stops, will hold you until the end. I thought Crimson peak was amazing and is my best horror movie of the year, haven t seen kristy, green inferno, or final girls I will and the visit was good. #Zombeaver Krampus deserves a spot on this list. It Follows is awesome Top spot for me is neck and neck between It Follows and The Witch. Where is Starry Eyes?, so much better than the overhyped  It Follows . Not where but when  and the answer is last year.    Don t think I d say it was better anyways, but closer than the IF hype makes it out to be.  Both good, neither great. Starry Eyes wasn t that good unless you re looking for gross shit It Follows was probably my favorite horror film of the year. I didn t care for Starry Eyes. It was pretty crappy but I guess it was ok if you are a gore hound. It Follows was soo overhyped! I didn t enjoy Starry Eyes that much, liked It Follows better, I gave both movies 6/10. For there are to many good films missing zombevers we are still here Charlie s farm the gift and I know I m missing a few more  Alright let s continue we are missing backcountry bone tomahawk bound 2 vengeance the editor girl house good night mommy and let us pray for me top 3 are -THE FINAL GIRLS -LET US PREY (with  Pollyanna McIntosh) -EXTINCTION (with Matthew Fox  &  Jeffrey Donovan) i really liked these 3 as well -MAGGIE (with Abigail Breslin  &              Arnold Schwarzenegger) -THE HALLOW -WE ARE STILL HERE i want to add KRISTY to this list but i m not sure if it was technically released here in the states in 2014 or 2015. Kristy was ok. Not sure why it is getting so much hype. It was pretty ridiculous but I have seen worse.  We Are Still Here is another one that was decent but nothing special.   I need to watch Let Us Prey. Let Us Prey was okay Slow year for horror, last year I could easily name 20 great movies, this year I had trouble with 10. I would have put Creep,  Bone Tomahawk and Goodnight Mommy in that list replacing a lot of weak entries especially in the last spots. Go ahead and name your 20 from last year Here we go: The Sacrament Afflicted Cheap Thrills A Girls Walks Home Alone at Night Housebound The Borderlands The Taking of Deborah Logan The Town That Dreaded Sundown Wolf Creek 2 Willow Creek Starry Eyes Late Phases Oculus Under The Skin The Guest Dead Snow 2 The Den La Cueva Raze The Babadook Over Your Dead Body Not a lot of them are as good as The Babadook, but even my least favorite (Deborah Logan) is a very decent little horror movie. Sigh, a bad year for horror movies. I thought this year was pretty awesome. Ding Ding DIng, we have a winner! Definitely agree Creep and Goodnight Mommy definitely deserved to be on this list. Question to the Bloody Disgusting peoples: How do you all prefer to look at a film s  release date?  Do you go by when it hits the festival circuit  even if that means it won t see a release to the general public for quite some time? Or do you go by when a film gets that initial public release via either theater or BD and Blu Ray? I ask because I remember seeing IT FOLLOWS on some 2014 best lists even though it wasn t  out.  On THIS particular list, we have films like FEBRUARY and THE WITCH  Would you all say those or  2015  movies, or would any of you venture to put those movies on a 2016 list? Just wondering. I usually go by when it s released to the public. I don t care that festival films make it on these lists. Gives me films to look out for. Only movies released to the public are aknowlege in my opinion.  Adding a movie to a best of list when it isn t even it for the public to see is just advertising for said movie. So many people hating on It Follows. So many dumbasses who wouldn t know great cinema if it bit them on their stupid faces. That being said, I appreciate this list. Going to check out some of these other films that I haven t seen yet. February sounds really intriguing. Turbo Kid may be gory but it s not a horror film. Did you not get  The Canal  in the US? It scared the crap out of me! It came out last year, so it doesn t qualify for lists this year. It made it on my  Most Disappointing  and  Most Disturbing Moments  lists from last year though. =) Brad still hasn t identified any actual plot-holes in It Follows, but his stupidity allows him to believe he has. Similar to how his arrogance has him making predictions about the timelessness of certain films that satisfied his juvenile tastes. The Green Inferno was bad, and I say that as someone who loves the italian cannibal flicks. Inferno was extremely uninsteresting, the shock scenes were quite ok (only the first one was actually any good), pretty much everything was uneven and the  message  Roth tried to convey was really disgusting. Films like Cannibal Holocaust are edgy, they feel like something you shouldn t see, while Roth s film is just a childish wannabe Good list (although I would have added Creep to it). I have not heard of February but will be seeking it out. It Follows is about the ghostly manifestation of an STD  It reads like a PSA against teen sex  Big whoop You have obviously never seen it. Please refrain from giving your opinion on what you know nothing about. I did see it, lol. If you can see that then you re brainwashed by the hype. It only reads that way if you re an idiot. Really happy to see It Follows at the number one spot! I would definitely replace some of these with Tales of Halloween, Maggie, The Hallow, and for decent studio horror probably Lazarus Effect and Insidious 3 in the lower spots. I have not seen The Witch but based on all the praise I m shocked it s not on here. Lazarus Effect and Insidious 3. You instantly make yourself out to be an idiot. Don t get your panties in a bunch, I literally separated my favorite horror from favorite studio horror. With all the crap released in theaters, Insidious 3 and Lazarus Effect were scary and well made. Cool list, though I can never accept any work of Shyamalan s made post-Unbreakable as good, let alone great enough to take a top-10 spot (where was the Witch?). Holy shit, so many new movies to watch, from the comments to this article. I gotta write this shit down. By the way i saw Krampus today and thought it was really good, it s probably to close to the end of they year to be on this list, unless you didn t like it. Really?? It Follows is your number one??? Ill give u that it was a new concept which is good and ridiculous (the part where he mentions it gets passed on from having sex got a good chuckle out of me and others in the theatre) but its not as great as so many reviews say it is. I just dont get yours and others love of this movie, I really dont it follows was a little better than mediocre, but the babadook got to be the worst. Your list is full of gimmes and a few completely overrated movies. Green Inferno sucked. It was full of terrible, annoying characters and stupid plot elements. a complete waste of time. It Follows was a good concept that fell on it`s fucking ass and only had a few good scenes. But hey, Go Figure Mr. Disgusting liked some shitty movies. His opinion was probably bought. These are what we call opinions, Mr. Hutton. You see, everyone has one and has the right to express them as they see fit. Just like everyone has an asshole and can choose to act like one, too. Just like you are right now ðŸ™‚ Merry Christmas, you whiny jerk. Yeah you are right, Mr Disgusting is totally bought off by big horror! Ha ha. If you made a top ten what movies would you put in place of the ones you mentioned you thought were terrible?  Good luck this better be good .. Wheres Ridley Scott? Hes a wickled duchebag.  Havent seen green inferno yet but dyin  Watched we are still here last night. Not impressed. Couple scares, couple gore scenes . Meh Besides what we do in the shadows..not lookn forward to anything. Im one to jump on it follows. Movie is crepy and effective Being aware of sleep paralysis certainly makes you more likely to experience it. That much has been proven. It s actually fairly common. I remember telling my dad about my experiences with it and he told me he had very similar nights in his bedroom as a kid. The same red eyes peering through the closet door actually. I got bored with The Nightmare and turned it off, despite being heavily interested in the topic. All of the subjects were too corny for me. And they acted as though they were chosen ones for having experienced sleep paralysis. Also, Eli Roth and his xenophobia needs to cut it out. It s getting really tired. First Europe gets trashed in the Hostel films. Then Chile in Aftershock (seriously, an entire prison breaks free and there s not a single law enforcement officer in the entire city?). Now, it s the Amazon with The Green Inferno. Every film is the same  spoiled, shitty white people go on vacation (or relief trip) and die in sadistic ways at the hands of scary foreigners. Has he been to any of these countries or did he have a scary encounter with Mickey Mouse at Epcot Center and swore off the rest of the world when he was a kid? So stupid. I d love to see him make a film about the Mickey Mouse experience. That I would pay to see Wordswithsam ur racism is some of the absolutely most rabid kind I have ever encountered. You  hate niggers, chinks, brown and red Indians, oh, and did I mention niggers?  Are you serious? What on earth are you talking about? I m commenting on Eli Roth s filmography and how every story tells the tale of white people traveling to a foreign country and getting mutilated in some way or another. I m suggesting that Roth is the one with the issues. Not sure how you could have possibly misconstrued that for racism on my part as it could not be the furthest thing from the truth. Eli Roth is a horrible director. His films are trash. And your point is well taken. It never occurred to me but you may be onto something. As the world gets smaller, these types of interactions are inevitable. But Roth is a horror director, how else do you think he would interpret the mood of American interactions with forgeiners? In the 70s and 80s teenagers who went on summer vacations to have sex and drink beer were tortured by vengeful spirits i.e. Jason Voorhees, Leatherface et al. How is this any different? It s not! The idea is the same: the world is a scary place, and those people who venture out into it, esp. those whose motives are not entirely wholesome, risk life and limb.  I m a little disappointed that Pod or Creep did not make this list however, The Green Inferno was definitely a good time. Not as gory as I had anticipated, but I loved every moment ðŸ™‚ Side note: super excited for Deathgasm. Green Inferno was pretty average. It feels like everything was in the movie to put it into an extreme path, added the shocking moment. But whether if it s cause the characters don t connect or not you quickly feel numb to it all. It fails in connecting to it all.  But I m pumped for A Christmas Horror Story after this. For a long time people have been calling out Mr. D for not being worth his salt needless to say this list just adds to the evidence that it s true. Mediocrity and paid promotion thy name is Mr. Disgusting. The new layout and AD based content solidifies it. Bone Tomahawk was one of the best movies of the year, period. Bone Tomahawk is a horror masterpiece! Wow your list is utter crap. What qualifies you to rate anything? I would listen to a chimp throwing his own poop at a wall first. What would your list be? Actually, you yourself sound like a chimp throwing his own poop at a wall. I thought 2015 was a much better year for horror than 2014 but after being reminded of all the good flicks this year I think this was actually a great year for horror. Especially horror/comedy we had 3 cult classics at least this year ( Deathgasm,Final Girls,What We Do In The Shadows) Those are all movies I will watch again and again for years to come. It Follows was incredible too. Mr Disgusting is right it will age like fine wine. HOW IS IT FOLLOWS CONSIDERED A GOOD MOVIE!!! i was looking forward to it for a long time coming, ever since i seen the trailer. and it just turned into such a terrible movie. everyone needs to stop giving this garbage praise. your list should of titled (im pulling these reviews out of my ass) February (The Blackcoats Daughter) was complete ass!
