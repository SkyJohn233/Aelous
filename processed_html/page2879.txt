Projects | Punk This Studios We are actively working on the tentatively titled  Project Survive  video game, and  Battle For Vitoria  board game. We are looking forward to sharing more details about it at a later time. Project Survive Tentative Title Video Game Project IP Type Active Development Project Status                     Project Survive is our first large-scale game. We are planning to release on PC first, and would love to have it on consoles (especially the Nintendo Switch). More details will be shared at a later time.                 Battle For Vitoria Official Title Board Game Project IP Type Active Development Project Status Battle For Vitoria (BFV)  has completed pre-alpha development, and is in active play-testing of the alpha build.  BFV  will receive a very limited print run when alpha development is completed. BFV  is a competitive War Strategy board game where players build, maintain, and mobilize a medieval high-fantasy army in order to achieve one of many possible win conditions; all the while ensuring that their opponents do not. The unique alignment, leadership, and loyalty systems present challenging decisions to the players, which can have both positive and negative outcomes echoed throughout their entire army. Unlike most other board games, BFV has no randomness, and leaves nothing to chance. Tactical skill and being able to out-think your opponent(s) is the key to victory.
