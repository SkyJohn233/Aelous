cheesy guitars guitarsite hello and welcome to the cheesy guitars this site is dedicated to those weird unplayable instruments that do n't even worth collecting the first reason we 've made this site is that there 's no information about these guitars no pictures and no reviews but they exist and they definitely worth checking out the other reason is that we love them too many of us started our carreer with those cheesy axes lots of these creatures came from the former soviet union czechoslovakia and other ex-communist countries although soviet guitars are definitely the winners there are also indonesian and korean companies making very cheap instruments with built-in speakers sparkle finishes and fairly high action and there are also handmade one-off guitars you wo n't beleive somebody actually played them so if you 're tired of reading about clapton 's favourite strat and brian may 's red special here 's something different hi i am a guitarist from the czech republic and i am really satisfied with the quality of my jolana diamant guitar i bought this piece from a passionate collector who had renovated it so the level of sound is really close to the les paul version i know what i am talking about because my bandmate has original gibson so we compare both guitars every rehealsal i understand commie guitars seem the worst to you but try to understand that it could be the only way how to start to play the electric guitar in that period because it was almost impossible to get any of the western models most of our amazing guitarists started to play jolana http //www.cheesyguitars.com i just happened to pass here and since there are some posts that ask certain things i 'd like to redirect those people straight to our forums where they can get some expert advice and thanks to everyone who keeps cheesyguitars alive and populated sincerely yours joseph ruzicka i found a mann guitar in my attic it is in new condition about 20 yrs old it has a number on it aj-201 can you tell me what the value might be thanks christine mann was made by ibanez between 1971-1983 there 's mann and then there 's mann 80 's i currently have 6 mann electrics 4 acoustics if you want to sell contact nortonblues yahoo.com i 'd just like to point out that me and one of my bandmates adore our jolanas i am actually renovating a bass of that type and although it may easily be as old as my father it can still be saved relatively inexpensively it can be restored to stage level although it was untouched for 15 years lying apart in somebody 's basement i ve purchased an old semi-ac jazz guitar graziella ii it says does anyone know something about her hey i have a copy of a les paul made by mann and it has a 9 volt battery with mini-effects processor on board looks like it could be cheesy i know it 's hard to play comfortably and sounds strange with plastic bridge saddles strat man dwight if u want to sell it i would be interested caraudiochampion yahoo.com w/ picture and price strat man dwight i just read about the poor quality of the jolana guitars from the 70 's does anybody know anything about the guitars they make today please tell me yep dude i know
