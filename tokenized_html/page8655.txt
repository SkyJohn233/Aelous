overcoming great adversity to achieve glittering critical and modest commercial success possibly not but you should make room in your callous heart for director barbara kopple 's miss sharon jones the

anime about the destruction of innocence it 's basically two and a half hours of fantastical vaguely terrifying uneasiness i 'm sorry my sister turned your parents into pigs but there 's nothing i can do pacific place all weekend 4 arrival arrival is an ominous thrumming beautiful thing that starts out being about aliens who need a decoder ring it ends up being about something quite different arrival is about big things—and the manner in which villeneuve gets to them as his camera slowly traces structures and landscapes both familiar and strange can t help but surprise and impress visually and aurally remarkable arrival sometimes unfolds like a clever puzzle and other times like a raw-nerve thriller throughout with heart and wit heisserer and villeneuve never lose sight of the film s characters—creatures in a situation that s weird and mournful exciting and threatening erik henriksen various locations 5 die hard a year after fox plaza a 35-story tower in century city los angeles was completed 1987 it starred in a film that brought it and bruce willis fame die hard fox plaza plays nakatomi plaza a building owned by a japanese corporation and bruce willis plays john mcclane a white nyc cop whose estranged white wife not only lives in la but appears to have gone to the other side the japanese side while mcclane visits his wife at nakatomi plaza things go crazy and we enter the world inside of the building its elevator shafts air ducts and structural spaces here postmodern architecture meets reagan-era hollywood cinema and makes lots of movie magic charles mudede central cinema 6 doctor strange the psychedelic visuals the clever asides the pure pleasure of having as good an actor as cumberbatch at the center of a silly superhero epic—all of that cast a spell on me and i came out of the theater utterly content doctor strange might have a lot of baggage but more than anything else it s fun suzette smith various locations 7 the eagle huntress the eagle huntress looks amazing the documentary s images—featuring a grinning 13-year-old aisholpan nurgaiv as she holds a splendid eagle half her size—are the stuff of myths i went in pumped up to see a girl-power/girl-falconer documentary with plenty of big cool-looking birds and i was not disappointed first-time director otto bell accomplishes a level of visual beauty we associate with bbc nature specials or idk lord of the rings it s breathtaking suzette smith seven gables 8 the edge of seventeen nadine is a type of teenage girl you 've never seen before she 's weird she has dark eyes and sort of curly hair all the kids at school hate her because she 's very mature and kind of mean she likes old movies and music she is convinced that she has bigger and more serious problems than any of her peers in a way that 's true her dad died suddenly when she was 13 and her family 's sanity and strength took an understandable hit nadine is in many moments entirely predictable and in others complex burdened and endearingly strange the edge of seventeen an r-rated coming-of-age movie full of sass and sweetness excels at embracing stereotypes and tropes—then immediately destroying them with funny and surprising writing julia raban meridian 16 sundance cinemas 9 fantastic beasts and where to find them i 'm annoying says eddie redmayne to dan fogler in the opening half-hour of fantastic beasts and where to find them he s like doctor who with gout and yet—just like the good doctor in even his lamest incarnations there s just enough charm glimmering beneath the surface and shining through the contrivances that you can t write him off entirely fantastic beasts featuring an original screenplay by j.k. rowling is annoying in the manner of scamander it is eager to please and amaze but undersells its spectacle until that spectacle becomes perfunctory it s a goofy blast of kid-lit in love with looney tunes-inspired adventure—except when it s a sour metaphor for child abuse and intolerance that owes one hell of a debt to stephen king s famous prom queen but somehow the two stories are sewed together just tightly enough that the tv pilot-esque clumsiness of fantastic beasts there will be four more of these films likely transforming asap into the dumbledore prequels can be forgiven for the power in its climax bobby roberts various locations 10 the handmaiden based on a novel set in the victorian era by welsh novelist sarah waters the film 's story happens during japan 's occupation of korea the 1930s and concerns a young female thief who is placed in the middle of an elaborate plot to scam a japanese countess but the plan is further complicated by the unexpected sexual attraction that grips the young thief sook-hee kim tae-ri and the countess lady hideko kim min-hee she works for as a handmaiden charles mudede varsity theatre 11 hunt for the wilderpeople sure hunt for the wilderpeople s scope is small but it gives you everything you could want from a movie it s smart emotional and even a bit action-packed once ricky and hec embark on an unplanned adventure in the forest but most of all it s funny so so funny wilderpeople is a hugely loveable movie that s suitable for date night or the whole family and i know that sounds like a hacky movie poster blurb but when a movie s this good it s tough to avoid clichés so i ll leave you with another don t miss it ned lannamann varsity theatre 12 manchester by the sea in manchester lee chandler affleck seems content to shovel walkways and unclog toilets for a living in boston until word comes that his older brother joe kyle chandler seen in flashbacks has died of a heart attack joe s will stipulates that he wants lee to move back to his titular hometown and become patrick s guardian lee however is haunted by past events and resists with a toddler s tenacity every effort by the people around him to help him come to terms i feel for the guy and you will too but after two hours i wanted to grab him by the collar and tell him to buck up after all he s at least going to get an oscar nomination out of it marc mohan various locations 13 moana moana is the disney princess movie everyone needs right now—or at the very least moana is the princess i 've been dreaming of since i was a little girl not every kindergartner can see herself in cinderella sleeping beauty or even nowadays frozen after years of witnessing people of color gunned down and beaten on-screen having a whole movie dedicated to showcasing the knowledge and beauty of brown people felt restorative yes moana is an animated children 's movie but it is important for children of color to be able to see movie audiences sit in awe of their people 's stories representation matters regardless of age ana sofia knauf various locations 14 moonlight moonlight is a film that has all of the major film critics in the country singing the loudest praises and is already breaking box-office records and happens to be a coming-of-age tale of a black american male but i want to make this clear the director of moonlight barry jenkins did not come out of nowhere he also directed and wrote one of the best films of the previous decade medicine for melancholy 2008 the wonder is that it took him so long to make his second feature which will most likely make a big splash at the next oscars expect jenkins to be one of the few black americans to win the award for best director charles mudede various locations 15 the princess bride eeveryone who can factually claim to be an american has seen the princess bride 150 times so why go see it on the big screen here 's why it 's delightful and hilarious and the goopy framing device gets out of the way fast and there 's that amazing scene where our heroine stands atop a hill exclaims oh my love and hurls herself into a full-body roll plus you can shout my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die in a theater siff film center 16 rules do n't apply tv may get all the shine nowadays but old-fashioned movie-star charisma goes a long way case in point warren beatty who s returned to movies after a 15-year hiatus he wrote directed and stars in rules don t apply a wholly fictitious movie about billionaire howard hughes beatty that foregrounds a forbidden romance between two of hughes s employees starlet-in-the-making marla mabrey lily collins and her driver frank forbes alden ehrenreich narratively the movie s a mess but like a bowl of melted ice cream—in this case hughes s preferred flavor baskin-robbins banana nut—it s still pretty delicious that s largely due to beatty who s as fun to watch on-screen as he s ever been it s really good to have him back ned lannamann pacific place and sundance cinemas sign up for the
