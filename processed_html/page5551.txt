Rockwell Group Designs A Treehouse-esque Playground for Park in Brownsville - Archpaper.com Rockwell Group Designs A Treehouse-esque Playground for Park in Brownsville Rendering of Imagination Playground in Brownsville by the Rockwell Group (Courtesy of the Rockwell Group) The Rockwell Group and NYC Parks unveiled their plans last week to turn a 1.5-acre section of Betsy Head Park in  Brownsville  into a lush and active playground. When designing Imagination Playground, the firm looked to treehouses for inspiration. The site will feature a winding ramp that snakes around London Plane trees and connects to slides and a series of jungle gyms that spill out into an open area with sand, water, benches, and plantings.

The $3.92 million playground was funded with the help of government subsidies from Mayor Bloomberg, Borough President Markowitz, and Council Member Mealy.

Right now the project is slated to break ground in spring of 2014 and open in 2015. Diagram of Imagination Playground Blocks (Courtesy of Imagination Playground)
