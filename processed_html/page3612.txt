Trinity Lutheran Church Early Childhood Ministry / Trinity In Action / Play-based Learning Along with teacher directed activities and group time, Trinity ' s curriculum allows time when the children are able to choose from a variety of activities to participate in and materials to play and experiment with.   Because children learn the best through play we start out at a very young age teaching our students how to play.  Toddlers and two ' s are taught how to play by first establishing boundaries, then providinng them a variety of materials, and finally just enough space to encourage their imagination to blossom.  The transition into learning from play comes very naturally without anyone knowing! Each classroom is set up with multiple learning centers that are stocked with age appropriate toys and activities that are designed to help students learn while they play.
