By Kristi Lowe and Kelsi Suter 7/6/16, 4:48 PM CET Updated  7/8/16, 9:01 AM CET Protesters demonstrate against the EU referendum result on June 28, 2016 in London, England | Christopher Furlong/Getty Images Protesters demonstrate against the EU referendum result on June 28, 2016 in London, England | Christopher Furlong/Getty Images After Britain’s decision to leave the European Union via popular referendum last month, political turmoil ensued. But don’t let the near-collapse of the British government make you think governments will be dissuaded from using this form of supposedly direct democracy in future: Referendums are more popular than ever. In fact, Britain’s is just the latest in a recent surge in Europe, and, despite its much-fretted-over results, it seems to have set the stage for even more to come: speculation has already begun that France, Italy, the Netherlands and others may soon follow suit. It’s easy to see why. Referendums, which bypass elected representatives by submitting a proposed law or public measure to a direct popular vote, let citizens vent their frustrations with the powerful elites that run their governments. Today, when large groups are complaining of exclusion from politics, and when frustration with immigration, globalization, perceived disenfranchisement and elitism have fueled the rise of Donald Trump in the United States and nationalist groups across Europe, referendums are a particularly useful mechanism for politicians who want to make sure their people feel heard. Many leaders view them as a safety valve for populist anger. But, in our experience working on referendum campaigns around the world with a major polling firm, we have learned that referendums are vulnerable to a number of serious flaws — flaws which call into question claims that referendums are a more direct form of democracy than other types of elections, and which should make governments think twice before offering them. Here are a few important things to consider: The irony of a referendum is that while it typically asks voters to check a simple “yes” or “no,” it is actually one of the most complicated forms of voting: The policy issues at stake are complex; the wording of the question on the ballot is often technical; during the campaign, voters are often bombarded with information from political players and advocacy groups they have never hear of. There is a reason why “If you don’t know, vote no” is a common slogan in these referendum campaigns. At worst, this confusion allows voters to turn the question they are being asked into a different question they would prefer to answer. For instance, in the 2015 Greece referendum on the bailout package, the people had to vote on an extremely complex and technical question about public finance. Greek voters were perplexed about what would happen if they voted yes or no, and they were given just over a week to make a decision. Even with 61 percent voting against the bailout, many were unsure how to interpret the results. Was this a rejection of austerity, a rejection of European institutions, or did the complex ballot wording leave the meaning too open to voters’ interpretation to say? A June 7 constitutional referendum on gender equality in the Bahamas provides another example of confusion hijacking the vote. In this conservative, Christian country, rumors spread that voting “yes” could lead to same-sex marriage, even though the issues on the ballot were only about gender equality and its role in citizenship rights. By Election Day, many were not voting on whether they supported equal rights for men and women, but whether they supported same-sex marriage and LGBT rights. Ultimately, 79 percent voted against the gender nondiscrimination bill. Studies have shown that referendums usually inspire lower turnouts than general elections — and how much lower is hard for pollsters like us to predict. This means that despite their resemblance to direct democracy in action, referendum results often depend less on the true balance of public opinion and more on which side has the more energized supporters. If the idea is to let the people decide, the truth is that minority opinions can easily take the wheel. Politicians offering up referendums cannot assume that mainstream views will prevail.

Carney Also On Politico Matthew Karnitschnig and Tara Palmeri In response to this problem, some countries require turnout thresholds in order to protect against minority views skewing results. But while this may solve that problem, these thresholds are also problematic — they are arbitrary, encourage nonparticipation for those who oppose a measure and can make interpreting results difficult. An April 2016 Italy referendum on offshore drilling and a February 2015 Slovakia referendum on banning same-sex marriage failed to drum up enough voters to pass; analysts will never know how many stayed home out of apathy, and how many out of strategy. Many smart referendum campaigns unite support across partisan lines, so as not to become a protest vote against the current government. The downside for governments is that this can leave room for fringe groups to take up opposition space and grab widespread attention. The recent referendum in the Netherlands, in which 61 percent voted against ratifying an association agreement with Ukraine, is a good example. Extreme or marginal figures like the far-right anti-Islam parliamentarian Geert Wilders, the Socialist Party and the satirical shock blog  GeenStijl  gained a mainstream following and media attention — and Wilders’ party, the PVV, is topping opinion polls in the wake of Brexit. The Dutch government, which called for the referendum and supports the agreement, has been left in the unenviable position of negotiating a ratification deal (the referendum was non-binding) without majority support. We saw many of these factors at work in the U.K.’s recent referendum. It was clear that confusion clouded the referendum process when many voters expressed regret over their votes. The core issues of leaving the European Union were obscured when the then UKIP leader Nigel Farage made populist anger around immigration the center of the Leave campaign, and when his campaign dubiously promised to send the £350 million a week it said was being sent to the EU to the National Health Service instead (a promise he has since walked back). The campaign went from being about a whole spate of complex issues to a few hot-button issues. One important way Brexit was different from these above rules for referendums, though, was that turnout  was actually quite high . None of this is to say that referendums are always pernicious. They can unite voters across political lines, and provide leaders a mandate for divisive issues. Ireland’s 2015 same-sex marriage referendum — the first time a country adopted marriage equality by national referendum — was an inspiring and important milestone in the world’s changing attitudes on the issue. The government decided to put the decision to the people, and instead of stoking negative rage, the public narrative was generally positive. Politicians from all major parties spoke eloquently about their own families and children — some even  coming out themselves  — and young people  rang their grannies  to discuss the vote. But the Brexit outcome shows that politicians may want to think twice before turning to referendums as an easy solution for populist frustrations. Direct democracy is often anything but direct.
