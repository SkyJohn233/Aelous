The result was a lost pin (spring ended up staying around).  If you have the base pads, you need this kit for that really fast repair.                                 Posted by Carmen on Aug 28th 2017                             Lost a Dawson basepad spring while I was cleaning my mags. Ordered this kit, now I have a replacement and plenty of extras in my parts kit.
