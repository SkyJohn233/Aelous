Fergusson 988T A faitly typical table top set of the early 50's.         About the only unusual thing with the set is to do with differences between         the  AC  and  DC  mains.         A second fuse holder allows the PY82  HT          rectifier to be bypassed enabling every last volt of  DC          mains to be utilised.         The under-chassis components can be accesed by removing a cover from the         underside of the set to aid servicing.         As with many sets from the era, an additional  " Cyldon "  tuner         has been fitted to enable reception of Band  III          signals.          The same chassis was used in a console version (model 983) but with a          " luxury "  push-pull audio output.  Has         probably had a hard life. Note the two fuse holders. No fuses, but plenty         of aluminium foil ! The DC operation fuse, sorry, foil is fitted so presumably         (I hope!) this set was last used on DC mains.         The Band  III  tuner is scary ... its mounted         within a fraction of the  EHT  rectifier and         where the EHT connects to the CRT. Sounds like fun !          The audio output transformer is mounted on the top of the cabinet, so         in the past the wires to the chassis have been cut to enable the chassis         to be removed. Call me picky but I'd have insulated the wires when they         were re-joined !!         There is a good layer of dust and cobwebs but that just means the set         hasn't been messed with during its hibernation.         But oh dear, fresh looking wood worm holes on one side of the cabinet         :-( So after posing for photo's it was wrapped in polythene and temporarily         relegated to the (concrete) garage.
