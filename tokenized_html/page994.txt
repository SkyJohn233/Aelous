dt z sensory devices some of the most interesting technical innovations in this field canbe seen in the sensory devices used to gather information from the realworld the purpose of these devices is to measure the actions of a person often a performer and to make the data available to a device that can respondintelligently to what is happening in terms of commercially available devices we have attempted to listthe best known and most readily available sensors here for an exhaustivelist see axel mulder 's excellent humanmovement tracking technology paper and its addendum this page is divided into three sections there are two reasons that you may need to create your own sensory devices.the first strike against commercial sensors is probably their expense weare artists after all and that means we 're usually short on cash the secondreason is that off-the-shelf objects may not measure the specific actionsthat you are looking for or may not measure them in the way that you need.this section is designed to help you find the information you need to createsimple and relatively inexpensive interactive sensory systems if you are a beginner we strongly encourage you to start at dan o'sullivan'sincredible physicalcomputing pages this hands on guide for artists goes intogreat detail from choosing sensors to soldering to interfacing them toa microcontroller next we would like to list a few very simple ideas for beating off-the-shelfcomponents into submission for your own purposes many drum controllers roland pad-80 and some drum machines alesishr-16 have inputs for external triggers these inputs can be connectedto piezo sensors which respond to vibration or impact you can purchasethese sensors at radio shack very inexpensively and then hook these upto the inputs on the drum controller or drum machine once you have doneso striking the piezo should generate midi note on off messages becausethey are small and thin the sensors can be attached to a number of surfaces walls and floors embedded in costumes etc there are a number of commercially available midi fader boxes whichusually sport a number of knobs or sliders moving the slider causes somekind of midi information often a continuous controller message to be sentout of the box it is fairly easy to crack open these boxes disconnectthe existing faders and replace them with your own this requires a bitof courage because it is possible to destroy the object in question if youare unskilled with a soldering iron etc the procedure is outlined below there are a number of possible applications but obvious choices includemeasuring the angle of joints how a viewer is touching parts of an installation etc note that we do not assume any responsibility for damage that occurswhen modifying devices in the way described below if you are at all unsurehow to do the following procedure either do n't do it or find a knowledgeablefriend to help you that 's it you should be able to turn on power to your device and useyour new fader to generate midi in the same way in which the old fader did many artists have created their own sensory systems to suit their specificneeds these creations range from the simplest hybrids of multiple off-the-shelfitems to systems that were created from the ground up we have listed severalof the devices that we know of here in the hopes that they may serve assource of ideas and inspiration if there is an significant non-commercially available system that wehave omitted here please let us know because of the small number of creators making use of alternative controllers many have come and gone still you may find one of these items wanderingabout looking for a home so we felt it was important to mention some ofthese devices here sensors interactivelanguages presentation devices roll your own dt z
