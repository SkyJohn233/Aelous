Listen ABC Conversations - Michelle Ransom-Hughes Alice was a quintessential, mould-breaking young woman of the roaring twenties. Raised in country Victoria, she was capable and confident, and not interested in what was considered proper. Alice opened a motor touring company in Melbourne during the first world war. The business grew and by the 1920s Miss Anderson's Motor Service included a mechanic's shop, staffed entirely by young women known as 'garage girls'. Loretta Smith has spent a decade researching the story of Alice's life and tragic early death.
