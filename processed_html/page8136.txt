The day Shia LaBeouf cried in Brad Pitt &# x27;s arms:  &# x27;I was so scared I had lost him as a friend &# x27; Shia LaBeouf has made plenty of headlines lately – from being punched in the face in a bar in February to being arrested after he refused to leave a performance of  Cabaret Fury " I had just come out of a situation where I had gotten into some contentiousness with the lead actor of the last job that I got fired from and I thought it was all going to go bad again, "  the 28-year-old admits, referring to his attempted Broadway debut in 2013 where he clashed with his  Orphans  co-star Alec Baldwin over  " creative differences " . Replay " After the first three days in boot camp, I had a fight with him, because he didn &# x27;t stick up for me. We were doing push-ups and I told the officer I was done, and Brad looked over at me like,  &# x27;Get your f---ing ass up &# x27; and I just thought,  &# x27;No way, man! &# x27; " I was so scared that I had lost him as my friend and I went off to the latrines and was just crying by myself when he came over and put his arm around me. It sounds super-cheesy but we just held each other and he was my brother from that moment on. " Brothers in arms: Brad Pitt (left) and Shia LaBeouf take the hard road to Germany in WWII drama  Fury . In person, LaBeouf seems like a walking contradiction, and it &# x27;s hard to know whether this is the well-behaved Shia on the publicity trail or a genuinely new, post-rehab Shia.  " I &# x27;ve been reconnecting with people that I had problems with, "  he offers as evidence of the latter.  " Alec Baldwin and I just got good, so that &# x27;s been a real blessing because he was a dude I have always looked up to, and I felt so bad about our dismount. " And what about his announcement in January that he was retiring from public life?  " I love acting and can &# x27;t imagine ever doing anything else, "  LaBeouf says.

" When I met Shia, he was at a place where he wanted to reinvent himself, he wanted immersion and he wanted truth, "  Ayer says.  " This is a guy who was a child actor and there &# x27;s a perception about him, but I &# x27;m going on record as saying he &# x27;s one of the absolute best actors I &# x27;ve ever worked with and I would take a lot of what &# x27;s happened recently as his attempt to sort of destroy his previous incarnation and to be recognised as that true, honest real capable actor that he actually is. " Despite high-profile films such as  Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  (2008)and  Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps  (2010), LaBeouf has always been better known for his off-screen antics, multiple arrests and a recent  " apology "  tour after he was caught plagiarising another writer &# x27;s work in his short film  Howard Cantour.com.

Is he crazy or just misunderstood?  " I think an artist &# x27;s job is to open yourself up to interpretation by the world, so you just can &# x27;t take it to heart, "  LaBeouf says of his stunts, which also included removing a tooth for  Fury.
