ArtStation - 010615 Portrait Study - Godfrey Gao, Joan Liu First study of 2016 - learning about values and trying to avoid the  " BLEND EVERYTHING "  method of shading. Stuck to one brush and one layer - might go back and use a second layer to add finer details. Realized waaaaay too late in the process to draw the form under the facial hair first before just assigning the entire cheek a dark value.
