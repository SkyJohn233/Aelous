Hey, I am still getting the  Could not load the Tomcat server configuration at /usr/share/tomcat7/conf. The configuration may be corrupt or incomplete. /usr/share/tomcat7/conf/catalina.policy (No such file or directory)  problem when I start the new server wizard.  I have added my username to the tomcat7 group.  Any thoughts? Hi, some additionnal troubleshooting fixes can be found at  http://directjump2java.blogspot.fr/2012/08/tomcat-7-and-eclipse-integration.html  . Mainly deals with incomplete configuration of tomcat7 in Ubuntu (symlinks and chmod stuffs). If you have installed both tomcat 6 and 7 then uninstall tomcat6 and then try to run .. it should work Also do the following steps : 1) go to the directory through terminal : /usr/share/tomcat7 2) sudo ln -s /var/lib/tomcat7/conf conf 3) sudo ln -s /etc/tomcat7/policy.d/03catalina.policy conf/catalina.policy 4) sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/share/tomcat7/conf I had the same problem. But I fixed with this: 1) go to the directory through terminal : /usr/share/tomcat7 2) sudo ln -s /var/lib/tomcat7/conf conf 3) sudo ln -s /etc/tomcat7/policy.d/03catalina.policy conf/catalina.policy 4) sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/share/tomcat7/conf Hi, All the steps worked except the “press Finish” ]on step 9… Bummer.
