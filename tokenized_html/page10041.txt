proximity to the streetcar we waited until we could find an affordable apartment off of 8th and st charles and have never been happier read 1 review nearby resident xa0 everyone automatically thinks of rowdy bourbon when it comes to new orleans but the real magic is uptown here you will find affordable to pricey local boutiques on magazine st. as well as culinary dishes that specialize in the

and relaxed this neighborhood is and how it seems to be very safe but i worry that it s not necessarily inviting to all types of people and is becoming overrun with tourism read 3 reviews niche user xa0 as stated before it is said to be the safest neighborhood in new orleans the homeowners in the area are all very well off with great careers including doctors and lawyers campus police is constantly doing rounds around the neighborhood since we are close to the broadway campus of loyola and an elementary school our home came with surveillance cameras and there are other cameras around the surrounding streets so my roommate and i feel extremely safe in this current apartment read 16 reviews former resident xa0 this is a great neighborhood for the most part people are welcoming and

the most part my dogs get out regularly and they will bring them back if they ve been out too long or call me to let me know where they are it s not perfect but it s pretty good housing prices are going up as there area is gentrifying but it is a convenient location not a long commute to other areas in the city and easy access to the interstate the biggest complaint is probably the broken streets but that s all over the city read 5 reviews explore the best neighborhoods to live in the u.s. based on crime public schools cost of living job opportunities and local amenities ranking based
