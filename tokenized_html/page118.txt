services can benefit your pet ultrasonography is a type of diagnostic technique that uses ultrasound waves to produce an imaging study this means that when we perform ultrasonography we can see internal images of the patient s body unlike some other imaging studies like x-rays ultrasonography does not use radiation instead ultrasonography uses high-frequency sound ultrasound waves to create a picture of what is inside your pet s body ultrasonography is a completely non-invasive painless way to diagnose and evaluate many common diseases an ultrasound machine generates ultrasound waves the machine is connected to a small probe that is held gently against your pet s skin the probe sends out painless ultrasound waves that bounce off of structures for example organs in your pet s body and return to a sensor inside the ultrasound machine the ultrasound equipment collects these reflected echoes and uses them to generate images that are viewable on a screen ultrasound waves can generate excellent images of abdominal organs including the liver spleen gallbladder and kidneys it is also useful for assessing fetal health and monitoring pregnancy in breeding animals and it can help us diagnose and stage determine the severity of some forms of cancer because ultrasound images are produced in real time this technology can be used to evaluate the heart as it beats this can help us detect abnormalities in the motion of heart valves blood flow through the heart and contractions of the heart muscle it can also be used to assess the heart for defects as we strive to provide our patients with the highest quality medicine and diagnostic testing we are pleased to offer ultrasound as one of our diagnostic capabilities pets today can live longer healthier lives than ever

fatal diseases that were once common unfortunately many infectious diseases still pose a significant threat to dogs and cats that are unvaccinated although vaccine programs have been highly successful and vaccines are considered routine today we as caregivers and you as pet parents can not afford to become complacent about keeping pets up-to-date on their vaccinations many vaccines are available for use in dogs and cats but not every pet needs every available vaccine some vaccines are considered core vaccines and should be administered to all pets whereas other vaccines are optional and may be recommended for pets based on a variety of factors such as their risk for exposure to disease vaccine recommendations can also change throughout a pet s life as travel habits and other variables change we will consider all these factors as we determine which vaccines your pet should have we understand that your pet is unique and that no single vaccine program will be ideal for every pet in every situation our doctors and other staff members are well-educated about veterinary vaccines and our goal is to give you the best advice for keeping your pet healthy let us develop a vaccination schedule and ongoing booster routine that accounts for your pet s lifestyle overall health risk for exposure to infectious disease and other factors vaccines help pets live longer healthier lives
