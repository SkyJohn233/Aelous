Gearbest Sponsored Review: Huawei AP007 13000mAh Powerbank: Page 4 of 4 | ProClockers Jump to navigation Posted by  Michael Pabia  on Friday, July 3, 2015 - 8:00am User Experience The Huawei AP007 with its 13000mAh capacity sure is massive. It was able to charge my smartphone with its 1620mAh battery 6 times from being fully drained. Carrying it around inside a backpack is easy but a pouch bag for the power bank and cable would have been a nice addition. The short cable may and may not help you at certain times like charging the power bank. Charging Charging the Huawei AP007 with its 13000mAh capacity takes a lot of time. To be consistent with the other power banks I reviewed, I used a smartphone charger with an output of 5V at 0.15A which is very low for the power bank's rated maximum input of 2.0A. The 8800mAh LUXA2 power bank took 10.5 hours, the 5000mAh LUXA2 slim power bank took 8 hours and the AP007 took approximately 13 hours to fully charge. It could be faster with a 5V, 2.0A charger though. Long as it may seem, the power bank stayed cool the entire charging duration. The Huawei AP007 13000mAh power bank sure is a powerful portable external battery pack. If you need one for your phone that's good for a week, this power bank is what you need. The metal casing of the power bank is a huge plus in my book giving it superb strength and durability. It stay cool when charging and upon usage. It is a bit heavy though and the short cable included is a bit 'short' for other purposes. You can find the Huawei AP007 13000mAh power bank at  Gearbest for only $24.94  including shipping worldwide! It does take a few days to arrive depending on where you are but it sure is cheap for a power bank with such high capacity.
