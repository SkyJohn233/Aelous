The lil’ ol’ kraut makers | Outside The Box | montrosepress.com Copyright ©  var today = new Date()var year = today.getFullYear()document.write(year) 2019 • Wick Communications Terms of Use   |   Privacy Policy Marilyn Cox When my sister Arla Schmalz was still in her own home, I looked forward to my birthday because I knew I would be getting a half-gallon jar of Arla’s homemade dill pickles and a couple of quarts of her homemade sauerkraut. Oh, they were so good. My entire family loved them. In fact, they were famous throughout the valley. My son Doug’s birthday was last week, and I try each year to make Beroks for him; little German meat and sauerkraut pies. I use a combination of both Arla’s recipe and her sister-in-law Ann Scheetz’s recipe that is in the Schmalz family cookbook. However, the Beroks are just not the same without the homemade sauerkraut. This year I had a pleasant surprise. My niece showed up, bringing me a jar of homemade kraut, wanting my opinion on it since it was the first time she and her husband had attempted it. It was excellent, and made me so happy. No, this wasn’t one of my German-side nieces. This was on the cowboy Burch side — Debbie and John Hawks. Debbie’s mother, my sister Helen, died 12 years ago, but items from her estate weren’t totally dispersed until this past summer. “I got Mama’s kraut-making stuff,” said Debbie, “so John and I decided to try making it this fall. John had never heard of such a thing, but he was curious to try. We don’t know if it is salty enough or too salty or too sour. We just don’t know how to judge it, so thought maybe you could tell us.” They did good! The Hawks live on a ranch on high mesa, raising cattle and horses. John is well-known for all his help at the county fair grounds and for his beautiful, well-trained horses. Both had careers with the BLM from which they are now retired. They both know most of the valley ranchers and are very knowledgeable about local history. I love to visit with them. Debbie, the youngest of Helen and Leonard’s eight children, grew up on their California Mesa ranch and at the Burch Cow Camp on 25 Mesa, experiencing life “the old-fashioned way.” Her mother cooked on a coal range most of her life, making her own kraut and mince meat as well as canning every fruit and vegetable and butchering chickens, geese and ducks. All of her meals were from scratch, main dish to dessert. For those of you who are not familiar with the tools needed to make big batches of kraut, one would start with a good heavy clay crock, a kraut cutter and a stomper. Crocks come in various sizes; Helen’s would have been huge. The kraut cutter is long, rectangular, approximately two inches thick, seven to eight inches wide and long enough to fit across the crock, with a large blade across the middle. The stomper is a thick board that has been smoothed down so there are no loose pieces of wood to slough off into the kraut. It is used to juice the cabbage by stomping a few inches at a time until the juice rises to the top. Success!  An email has been sent to   with a link to confirm list signup.             Error!

The cutter is placed over the crock and the cabbage sliced directly into the crock. After three or four inches, it is well-salted, then stomped until juice starts rising. The process is repeated until the crock is about three-quarters full. After the last stomp, a clean wet cloth is placed over the cabbage, then covered with a heavy plate topped with a rock heavy enough to put pressure on the plate, keeping juice over the cabbage. It is helpful to have a cool cellar in which to keep the crock while the cabbage is fermenting, taking several weeks to complete the process. When the mixture passes the taste test, it is placed in clean sterilized jars, sealed and cooked in a pressure cooker according to directions. It can then be kept in a cool place for many months. Well, do you get the idea how much work this entails? That’s why I appreciate it so much. Today you can Google directions as well as order supplies from Amazon for making just one small batch. Could it be anywhere near the same? Marilyn Cox, a native of Montrose County, grew up on a farm and was always surrounded by countless family members who instilled the love of family and history.
