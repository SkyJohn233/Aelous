The Americans in Paris: A Gala New Year's Eve with the Cathedral Choir  Celebrate the end of 2017 with Seattle’s longest-running classical New Year’s Eve concert, featuring music composed for famous Parisian churches like the Notre Dame and St. Sulpice performed by the St. James Cathedral Choir with the accompaniment of two full organs.  (Downtown, $30) Artist Home's 6th Annual New Year's Eve Celebration  Artist Home, a pillar of the Northwest music community, will present and host a night of live music and dancing in the sixth year of this tradition. Artists for this iteration include Cataldo, Hobosexual, SassyBlack, the Maldives, Smokey Brights, Cumulus, Fine Prince, Invisible Shivers, Sundries, and many more.  (University District, $50) Bollywood New Year's Eve  Wicked Karma has taken over the New Year's Eve-iest venue in town, the Fremont Foundry, to throw its Bollywood vibes across the upstairs penthouse, rooftop, and atrium with see-through dance floor. Shake it out all night to DJ RDX playing Seattle's best Bollywood, with a midnight champagne toast, a Desi food feast, party favors, and more. VIP tickets include unlimited trips to the bar.  (Fremont, $43-$74) Candi Pop NYE  If you own several glitter chokers and routinely take "Which Spice Are You" quizzes, this NYE edition of popular dance night Candi Pop is for you. Feel free to embrace all your guilty pleasures and spread that unicorn rainbow boy-band/girl-power magic around town in celebration of the new year.  (Capitol Hill, $15-$25) Countdown at the Bayou  If the holiday’s glut of prohibition-themed parties doesn’t appeal to you, transport yourself instead to the balmy Bayou with Capitol Cider’s French Creole fête, hosted by drag queen Tipsy Rose Lee. Wash hushpuppies and beignets down with crisp sparkling cider as you take in a burlesque performance from “bluestocking bettie” Jesse Belle-Jones and live music from psych-rockers General Mojo’s. There will also be a magician and psychic readings to add some enchantment to your evening. VIP tickets include a coat check, hush puppies, beignets, a midnight toast, a psychic reading, reserved exclusive seating, and a gift bag. (Capitol Hill, $45-$600) DROP THIS! NYE 2018  With a capital-S Stacked lineup of talented local DJs and producers, Monkey Loft will tower over their NYE competition thanks to live sets by Hanssen, Succubass, Sharlese, Chad Neiro b2b Kadeejah Streets, Justin Collins b2b Rhines, Nikolay Cloud b2b Kyle Douglas, and Sean (Night Train) b2b Peter Evans.  (Downtown, $15/$20) Eldridge Gravy  &  the Court Supreme, Bread  &  Butter  If there is one thing to do before the shitshow of this year ends, it’s go and get your get-downs you’ve been hopin’ to get off with Eldridge Gravy  &  the Court Supreme. Course it’ll be a breeze, ’cause, as I’ve said before, “They’re a full and funky complement of honkin’ horns, tinklin’ keys, uh, lots of sweat, and a hype man, all bent on laying down high-energy, concrete-thick, late-1970s funk.”       MIKE NIPPER (Ballard, $20) Hell's Belles, Belles Bent for Leather, Iron Dragon  It’s become a local rock tradition for world-renowned, all-female AC/DC tribute band Hell’s Belles to ring in the New Year with a high-octane live show. The simple term “tribute band” isn’t enough to encompass the sheer awesomeness of Hell’s Belles, though, as they’re so much more than your typical cover band. Sure, the music is spot-on, but it’s the pure ass-kicking energy that pours from each member that pays the biggest homage to the Australian rock legends. Expect a fitting tribute to the late, great Malcolm Young by way of blisteringly loud guitar solos.      KEVIN DIERS (Eastlake, $10-$25) Manatee Commune  Manatee Commune is gaining momentum as a producer of pleasant, chillworthy electronic songcraft with crossover potential. The Bellingham multi-instrumentalist has a sweet touch with melodies and a keen ear for vocalists—Moorea Masa, Marina Price, and Flint Eastwood—who complement his dewy, pastel tonal bouquets and delicate rhythmic origami. Manatee Commune’s self-titled album on Bastard Jazz explores the lushly beauteous, almost symphonic territory of fellow Washingtonians Odesza, but on a more intimate scale. Overall, the production is too well-scrubbed and cute for my taste, but there’s no denying the meticulous craftsmanship of it. This young man’s going to go far.      DAVE SEGAL (Capitol Hill, $25/$30) A New Year's Eve Soiree with Thunderpussy  These four Seattle women—Molly Sides (vocals), Whitney Petty (guitar), Leah Julius (bass), and Ruby Dunphy (drums)—make rock music that's built for IDGAF id-liberating. Thunderpussy's songs make a beeline for your lizard brain and then impel you to bang the container in which said lizard brain sits. In this regard, they resemble the lubricious ruggedness of AC/DC, Led Zeppelin at their raunchiest, and the Runaways. No, it's not innovative, but Thunderpussy's hard rock slams with a classic AOR punchiness.  DAVE SEGAL (Downtown, $30/$35) New Year's Eve: The Flavr Blue (DJ Set)  Seattle-Los Angeles hybrid group the Flavr Blue, known for their atmospheric R , trappy beats, and electro-hiphop crossover slices, will DJ this New Year's Eve all-night bash.  (Capitol Hill, $35) New Year's Eve with BowieVision  Fact: I was invited to a BowieVision show when the tribute band came through town earlier this year. I was too pregnant to say yes. Actually, I was only about four months along, but I worried about vomiting on my shoes while trying to lose myself in the music of one of my (late) favorites. This particular seven-piece of David Bowie tributeers apparently dress up in costumes inspired by the Thin White Duke (minus wigs and makeup), and deliver note-perfect, showmanship-savvy selections spanning from earlier in his career (“Space Oddity,” “The Man Who Sold the World”) to 1980s-era jams (“Modern Love,” “China Girl,” “Let's Dance”) to 1995’s “I’m Afraid of Americans” (to which I can relate now more than ever). Be forewarned: There’s little in the way of “deep cuts” (unless you’re a closet fan of “Blue Jean”). The $125 ticket includes admission, an appetizer, entrée, dessert, a glass of champagne, and party favors.      LEILANI POLK (Downtown, $90/$125) NYE: Darqness vs. 69/50  Excellent local QTPOC collective Darqness will join forces with artist group 69/50 for a New Year's Eve party rife with hiphop, rap, R , and electronica talent. Get ready for ripping live sets from cosmic performers like DoNormaal, Guayaba, Taylar Elizza Beth, and Brian is Ze, and high-energy dance blocks from Darqness resident DJs Toya B, Howin 1000, Dos Leches, and Reverend Dollars.  (Hillman City, $10) NYE Party with Tiffany Wilson and Screens  Memphis-bred funk and soul queen Tiffany Wilson will headline this high energy NYE party with support sets by local electro-psych dance group Screens and DJ Eugene Fauntleroy.      LARRY MIZELL JR. (Wallingford, $20) Poncho Sanchez Latin Jazz Band  The Poncho Sanchez Latin Jazz Band offer plenty of chances for you to shimmy and shake to their warm, slinky, percussive-fueled rhythms during Seattle’s end-of-the-year chill. Mexican American namesake Sanchez has been rapping, tapping, and slapping congas for crowds since he played his first ever set in the mid-1970s with renowned vibraphonist Cal Tjader, with whom he played until Tjader’s death in 1982. Sanchez went on to release more than 30 albums as a solo  conguero  (backed by a full band that currently includes players on timbales, bass, trumpet, sax, trombone, bongos, and piano), and has built on his Latin-jazzy sound with elements of R , soul, cha-cha, and salsa music.       LEILANI POLK (Downtown, $36.50) Sallie Ford, Lonely Mountain Lovers, La Fonda  Portland artist Sallie Ford on the bill is almost too good to take. Ford’s album  Slap Back , on which she metamorphosed from very-good-singer-songwriter-with-a-country-bent to garage-soul-psych-rocker (who still writes fantastic songs), has made the past year a lot more bearable.      SEAN NELSON (Ballard, $15) SHINE NYE  Shine on, you crazy diamond, at the Kremwerk/Timbre Room complex with a New Year's Eve party dedicated to all things that shimmer, sparkle, and glitter. The music across three stages will run the gamut from underground house to techno to left-field hiphop and club music. Expect a strictly local affair behind the decks with the likes of Upper Left's Sean Majors, DoNormaal collaborator Luna God, and Jet's DJ Zai. Obligatory champagne toast at midnight, but with something no other club can match: Little Maria's Pizza open late for a party running until 5 a.m.  GREG SCRUGGS (Downtown, $45-$350) Get all this and more on the free  Stranger Things To Do mobile app —available now on the  App Store  and  Google Play .
