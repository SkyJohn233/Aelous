Famous Chef - Restaurants in Stevenage (address, schedule, reviews, TEL: 01438727...) - Infobel This website uses cookies to ensure you get the best experience on Infobel  More info Treat their customers really poorly. Used to be a big spender here but will never ever order from them again. Absolutely disgusting. Spoke to alleged manger to query extra cash cost on receipt (I had paid online) as delivery guy didn ' t know and just advised we needed to pay. Delivery guy rude to a member of my family who opened the door and took the order. When I spoke to the manager who refused to give his name - he just advised you can ' t expect to put extra sauce and pancakes in notes without paying for it. Now I don ' t have a problem paying for it but its the principle and the attitude that came with it from the delivery guy and manager. I used to spend on average  50- 70 each takeaway (via Just Eat and Hungry House and ringing direct) and then I am spoke to in an unbelievable way. The alleged manager should go on a customer care course instead of insulting people who have been loyal and high spending customers.  Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Email
