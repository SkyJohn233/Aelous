Is there an estimate of Trump ' s support base mean education? - Quora a Pjrw d l HR b phZWz y GJGw SAe S tALF c HSWB r Yr i L b FE o D l TAa hycnb P fJbii u jsQDe b bnYV l AY i Lh s nT h D i w n weeAb g k The closest I can get to an answer is from an exit poll sent to me by a friend not on Quora but wanting to respond to your question. It shows that 51% of “high school or less” voted for Trump but 45% high school or less voted for Clinton. At the other end, 58% of those who had some level of graduate training voted for Clinton. Only 41% of “post-graduates” voted for Trump. Hope this helps. 1,824,972 Views 465,825 Views 1,443,937 Views 2,617 Views 1,265,353 Views About the best you can find is here… Education, Not Income, Predicted Who Would Vote For Trump TLDR; The lower education level and (only in general) the poorer the area, the more it went for the Tangerine Titanic. If that’s a basis to feel smug about, well, that’s another question altogether. Remember… we are all passengers on the “Tangerine Titanic” now, and Trump is the captain… likely if he sinks the ship, we all go down with it, and he floats off with Julie The Cruise Director on the only lifeboat. s QQ p tBtx o feE n S s JFXm o QJHHw r E e TNHP d FBKyr nk b osWVw y BPovd sJF W Yo o olOMA r MoK l Oe d Fle l JbGn i GhCff f wZO e Rkf s LLW t tkT y dKEei l fHImO e Dcoqv Yes, it is very close to the average level of education among the standard Republican voter, if by “his base” you are referring to people who voted for him. It is Not, as has been speculated, significantly lower. Also, the mean income for a Trump supporter is in excess of $50,000 household income per year, well above the national average. 465,825 Views 1,824,972 Views 64,279 Views 1,443,937 Views 2,617 Views 1,265,353 Views 286,078 Views 5,556 Views 426,927 Views 28,354 Views 30,767 Views 9,203 Views 1,630,756 Views 124,453 Views 51 Views
