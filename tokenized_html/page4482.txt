a definition of mission capable mission capable foundations bottom line up front this article covers what it is to be mission capable how to determine your mission and then how to determine your mission essential task list this will give you the tools to determine if you are mission capable in the army we talk about our equipment and informally our personnel as being mission capable we have really two categories of mission capable fully mission capable fmc or non-mission capable nmc our units report to their higher commands each day called the nmc report as to the status of all their equipment anything that isn t fmc is nmc no caveats this isn t to say that everything has to be 100 perfect for a piece of equipment to be fmc for example let s use a unit that has 20 vehicles and 100 rifles if one of those vehicles has a side view mirror missing it is still fmc if the vehicle has a steady leak of oil that pools called a class iii leak it is nmc the missing mirror and leaks are called faults there is a manual for every piece of equipment that tells you which faults make it nmc for each of us personally there is no official manual only you will decide what makes you nmc it will be based on what your mission is and whether you have a challenge like a fault with a piece of equipment that prevents you from doing your mission in order to know if you are mission capable you have to know two things military units typically have two kinds of missions enduring and specific enduring missions are general and cover the reason the unit exists specific missions would be precise in language and created for temporary operations which can be as short as one day or as long as something spanning years that are published in operations orders examples of enduring mission statements examples of specific mission statements you will notice the enduring statements are not very detailed as to where or when anything will happen specific mission statements are the opposite they denote who will do what when where and why if you think of yourself as a military unit you can follow the analogy here your enduring mission statement will be what you do why you exist you can then develop specific mission statements for temporary missions consider the following example joe is an accountant who is a serious amateur photographer he has a blog where he posts photos and reviews of photography equipment he has a wife and two children he likes to read books about history play chess online and occasionally play golf on weekends in the summer potential enduring mission statement joe is a father husband and accountant that supports his family he does a variety of recreational tasks with a focus on photography maybe joe decides he is unhappy with his physical fitness level he may create a specific mission statement for himself such as joe follows a paleo diet and regular exercise plan starting 1 january 2015 in order to improve his health and appearance with joe s specific mission he may have a lot of implied tasks to accomplish his specific mission such as joe may also have specific objectives for this mission the unit metl is the list of things you must do in order to accomplish your enduring mission once you know what your mission is you can then develop your metl tasks for army units this list is generally 20-30 things with 3-5 key ones that are your mission essential tasks mets for 1st brigade/1st armored division it may look something like this this list makes it very clear what types of operations this unit will be asked to do in war the unit then assesses strengths and weaknesses identifies a training plan resources it and executes it it is always reassessing progress on all of these tasks since they are on the metl let s use joe again as our example joe may have the following tasks identified you can see that joe can now look over his metl and conduct his assessment of whether or not he is mission capable in all areas of his life he may be doing poorly on his personal finances however he may be doing very well with regard to spending quality time with his family he may be doing ok on both of his health mets but knows he could do better he exercises regularly but ends up sitting at his desk all day he eats well most of the time but cheats more than he would like his sleep is sporadic sometimes quality but other times he stays up too late and knows it isn t healthy joe may generate some specific courses of action coas to address his shortfalls for example for 1.1 personal finances joe may decide he needs to develop a budget he now has a method an action he can take to address an area where he isn t doing well which will contribute to his overall mission capability if joe is spending a disproportionate amount of time worrying about money he will likely fight with his spouse over it and the effects will trickle down into his whole life for 3.1 joe could buy a pedometer develop a plan to get up every 30 minutes and walk around his office for a few minutes or buy a standing desk to accomplish his mission to be good at life he has to deal with his tasks that can make him non-mission capable nmc we started first defining what we live for our mission and then determining the things we must do our metl to live the life we want to live some of your mission essential tasks will be things you must do whereas some may be ones you want to do for most people though something like joe s metl will apply consider it as a starting point for some self-exploration into what your mission is and whether or not you are mission capable question what is your mission metl post thoughts to comments army prt you hate it because you don t understand it you are also doing it wrong 19 february 2017 in articles mission
