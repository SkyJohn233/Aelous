singularityat the poles universal coordinated time utc in the order year month day hour minutes and seconds for which the function calculatesthe conversion specified as one of the following for the year value enter a double value that is awhole number greater than 1 such as 2013 for the month value enter a double value that isa whole number greater than 0 within the range 1 to 12 for the hour value enter a double value that is awhole number greater than 0 within the range 1 to 24 for the hour value enter a double value that is awhole number greater than 0 within the range 1 to 60 for the minute and second values enter a double valuethat is a whole number greater than 0 within the range 1 to 60 specify these values in one of the following formats 1-by-6 array specify a

iau 1976 precession model and the iau 1980theory of nutation to reduce the calculation this model and theoryare no longer current but the software provides this reduction methodfor existing
