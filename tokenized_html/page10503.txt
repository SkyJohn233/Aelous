s01e09 fucksgiving orangeisthenewblack whoa how about susan x27 s crazy eye x27 s parents i can x27 t wait to see her back story that was quite interesting fuck sam healey yeah seriously the way his character turned after chapman still got the track opened was not expected fuck_that_guy i think that x27 s the problem so maury kind ira glass right mendez always has been a certain level of asshole though but healy almost matched him for assholery this episode i mean when pornstache thinks you x27 ve gone too far you x27 ve gone fucking too far i must have missed something why is healy so mad at chapman he x27 s been a little peeved at her since wac attack but what made him really mad was being told she was having sex with alex he thought she was going to be a good little girl who toed the line did what he told her and took her medicine without complaint turns out she x27 s got a mind of her own dares to dislike him and worst of all is a lesbian he x27 s a misogynist and a homophobe since when can inmates have shoelaces especially in solitary confinement.. little real world details aren x27 t really this director x27 s strong suit or what this series is really trying to do this ain x27 t oz on another note i just finished this episode and know that i only have four left i x27 m not ready for it to end but know that i can x27 t pace myself either i have to watch why is cheating so justified seriously shits fucked up yo i loved the ending of the show they really nailed the final season so i x27 ve decided to rewatch it all i x27 ve rewatched pretty much every year in between seasons but there x27 s none left so this will be the first time knowing how it all ends this post will have spoilers so don x27 t read if you haven x27 t finished the show yet first i want to say how sad it is to see taystee so happy pretty much since the end of season five her entire story was depressingly dark and she was consistently pushed down so to see her jumping around laughing singing etc it makes it very sad knowing what x27 s coming i think the scenes with piper before she goes to prison also have a little bit more power for me now when she and larry have sex the night before she cries during it and again knowing everything to come makes you realise they never really had a shot this was her last night as this version of piper reds hair is really red in the pilot and not orange as it is through most of the show which is pretty funny also the prison somehow feels emptied especially the cafeteria though that x27 s probably just cause it x27 s the pilot nichols is my favourite character but god she comes off as predatory in the first episode haha the use of flashbacks in the series is great and the pilot is no exception seeing piper and her life with larry and her friends as she x27 s making soap and living this perfect middle class life and then immediately seeing it juxtapositioned with her life with alex when she was younger is very interesting and also believable as well seeing some characters that weren x27 t in the last two season boo watson etc was nice and especially seeing miss rosa i have to say whole season two and four are my favourites the pilot and the first season really did an excellent job at setting the show up and while i think it had a couple of dips in quality most of season three parts of season five it was a really solid show throughout it x27 s entire run piscatella torturing everyone in season 5 really fucked me up like legit when barb and carol kill their little sister shiiiiiit mine has got to be red my vote goes to season 3 episode 4 where she tells her family at visitation that she has a girlfriend and then proceeds to moan as if orgasming while looking her mother in the eye it s the worst anyone else super bothered that they never explored the super obvious possibility that pepa isn t yadriel s baby i really was curious to see how that would blow up but nothing happened not gon na lie he didn t really stand out to me that much he was alright in the beginning but then banging polly just went downhill for me i d say i m biased because vause is my favourite character and favourite ship with chapman though does anyone know what happened to danny pipers older brother danny is mentioned multiple times but his only appearance was in a family photo in the first episode am i missing anything or was he just forgotten about by the writers 79.5k members 89 online jun 6 2013 cake day
