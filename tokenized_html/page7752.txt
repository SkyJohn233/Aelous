how many h atoms arev in 0.100 mole of ammonium sulfate nh4 2so4 yahoo answers 0.800 mole of h atoms this is because there are 8 moles of h atoms in one mole of nh4 2so4 formula units or expressed another way 8 h atoms in every formula unit of nh4 2so4 edit oops forgot this step 0.800 mol times 6.022 x 10^23 atms mol 4.82 x 10^23 atoms to three sig figs it x27 s simple like the person above me showed there are 8 h atoms in one molecule of ammonium sulfate nh4 has four obviously and since there are two units so to speak of nh4 you get 8 h atoms 0.100 mole of ammonium sulfate will have 8 times that of h. so you will have 0.800 mole of h atoms safely permanently remove moles warts and skin blemishes 1 mole 6.022*10^23 in one mole of nh4 2so4 there are 8 moles of h atoms in 0.100 mole of nh4 2so4 there are 8*0.1 moles of h atoms.. then the total number of h atoms in 0.1 mol= 6.022*10^23 8*0.1 there are 8 h x27 s in each formula unit so you have 0.800 mol h or 0.800 mol 6.02e23 atom/mol 4.82e23 atoms of h in case you are able to no longer write the formula you are able to no longer do the question nh4 2s is ammonium sulphide it includes 2 moles of nh4^+ ions the formula represents one mole of nh4 2s please verify your answer
