By now, we offer more than 250 different figure sets and on www.modellfiguren.de  even individual figures. This is no small feat. The  THW (Technical Aid Agency)  set contains five model figures, all of which wear blue protective gear. The gear consists out of a bright blue knee-high jacket, a pair of bright blue pants and black boots. Of course, on their heads a yellow safety helmet is obligatory. Furthermore, the entire safety gear contains yellow reflectors for visibility and safety at night. The figure set also contains a standby set.
