minilathe tooling north branch reels in 2015 i replaced my sherline mill with a minimill little machine shop 3990 the switchover was simple i only had to make some special hold down clamps to continue using my sherline rotary table with the new mill now i have gone a step further and bought a minilathe i chose micromark 84631 because it has 20/inch leadscrews on the cross slide and compound i locate the cutting tools by reading the dials at the handwheels and i can not work with a dial that has 62.5 divisions during lathe assembly my attention was drawn to the system for adjusting the carriage gibs it uses a combination of screws to push and pull the gib none of these screws can be properly tightened because there is no solid stack of parts to tighten against so i removed the push set screws and put round shims under the gib and around the pull cap screws the tool post can clamp a bit as large as 5/8 inch but you would have to do a lot of grinding to get the point down to the right height i have many 1/4 inch bits from my sherline lathe that i will continue using the brass shim here brings a 1/4 inch bit up to working height and the shoulder centers the bit under the clamping screws it is obvious that the 3 inch chuck for the new lathe is more robust than the sherline 3 jaw chuck but this extra heft comes at a price changing chucks is a matter of fiddling with studs and nuts in a confined space rather than just spinning the chuck onto a spindle nose thread further i am heavily invested in sherline chucks significantly the 4 jaw chucks can serve as milling vises and can be quickly transferred to the rotary table on my mill so i am highly motivated to continue using my sherline chucks my solution is to buy an er-32 collet chuck from little machine shop this allows me to chuck stock of up to 3/4 inch diameter through the hollow spindle when i first installed the collet chuck base on the spindle i found the tir on the taper to be about .0001 inch then i chucked a gage pin and read about .0002 inch tir note 9 april apparently this was luck the second bolt-on measured .002 tir on the taper later same day i made several installs one position consistently has .002 tir another .001 but the best position is under .0003 the key to using my sherline chucks is to leave the er-32 chuck in place and make an adapter with the sherline 3/4-16 thread this adapter is duronze it has 3/4 inch od and a bore of a little more than 1/2 inch sherline sells a similar adapter but it does not have a bore here is the adapter installed and here is a sherline chuck mounted to keep chips from falling where they may i tape transparency film to the stock chip guard and i have installed a piece of acrylic sheet in front of the carriage note also a piece of tygon tubing split around the exposed lead screw from lms i bought several accessories jacobs chuck live center die holder hand crank and cut-off tool with all this i believe that i have replaced all the sherline lathe functions except for knurling thrust plate for compound slide in turning grayrock 2010 in fixtures full text of article in power fibers in articles thank you for sharing your experience of trnaitionaing from our sherline lathe to the minimill little machine shop 3990 i am new to mini machining and have a sherline vertical 5400 mill with dro i am fascinated and in awe of the beautful fishing reels you have built on your mini mill and lathe thanks again for being so forthcoming with the benefit of your experience and jnowledge fill in your details below or click an icon to log in you are commenting using your wordpress.com account log out change you are commenting using your google account log out change you are commenting using your twitter account log out change you are commenting using your facebook account log out change connecting to s notify me of new comments via email notify me of new posts via email rod and reel maker 's forum classic reels forum reelsmithing the eclectic angler rkp cane rods ausable trout lovells lths online metals speedy metals mcmaster-carr janelle studio trout purgatory belvoirdale pinterest fly reels acord leather bertram rod tools enter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email join 86 other followers follow
