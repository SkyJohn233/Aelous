Introduction: Patients with Addison s disease are burdened by substantial comorbidity and likely require a large package of care. There is a proportion of South African patients who can afford private health-care, comparable to health-care offered in a developed country. We hypothesised that comprehensive package of care costs for Addison s disease is relatively high. Methods: We identifed 131 patients with Addison s disease within a private sector cohort, using ICD 10 code (E27.1). Demographic, co-morbidity and cost analysis data from claims were collected as of November 2015 (Rand/EURO=0.06), for the duration that the patients were members of a medical insurance company. Results: The median (IQR) ages were 51 (37 67) in 2015 and commencement of membership 46 (33 62.5) years, respectively and membership duration 61.9 (36.4 103.5) months. There were 56% female patients, 75 and 100% received hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, respectively. The most prevalent comorbidities were: hypothyroidism (34%), hypertension (32%), hyperlipidaemia (28%), gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (12%), congestive cardiac failure (8%), depression (8%), ischaemic heart disease (7%), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (6%). 15 and 7% of patients with Addison s disease had at least one adrenal crisis and one admission for ischaemic heart disease, respectively within the study period, with median number of admissions per patient of 2 (1 4). From the perspective of the provider, mean overall and mean monthly overall direct costs for patients with Addison s disease were  &# x20AC;15 163.80 and  &# x20AC;304.26, respectively. The mean comparable costs for patients with both hypertension and hyperlipidaemia were  &# x20AC;10 911.47 and  &# x20AC;181.50, and for AIDS patients on antiretroviral treatment (ART) were  &# x20AC;10 643.93 and  &# x20AC;236.00, respectively. Conclusions: Substantial comorbidity, predisposition to adrenal crises, ischaemic heart disease contribute to the higher average package of care cost of Addison s disease, compared to patients with both hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, and patients on ART.
