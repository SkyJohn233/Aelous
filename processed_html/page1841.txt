Miranda July's debut feature is a charmingly offbeat and observant film about people looking for love. Tap to review this movie Super Reviewer Rate this movie Oof, that was Rotten.

For a first film, I was astounded.                                     Brandon Judell                                             "Me and You" has a refreshingly unhysterical (but sometimes hysterically funny) take on what it's like for kids to grow up in a world of Internet sex, broken families and precocious sexual curiosity.                                     David Ansen                                             Click with it and there are elements to enjoy, but the title suggests a universal significance the film can't supply.                                     Nev Pierce                                             It seems quite possible that Me and You marks the arrival of an artist who may affect -- disturbingly yet helpfully -- films and audiences to come.                                     Stanley Kauffmann                                             Here's a perfectly twee little romance all but smothered in a blanket of indie 'edge.'                                     Roger Moore                                             These characters are sympathetic.                                     Susan Walker                                             Writer/director Miranda July's exquisite romantic comedy is one of the most original and unique films of recent memory.                                     Micheal Compton                                             A refreshingly un-ironic slice of life, free from cynicism, with an infectiously upbeat outlook that lifts the spirits and makes the heart soar.                                     Matthew Lucas                                             Fittingly for a film with such an all-inclusive title, July finds something wondrous in peoples' interactions in everyday life.                                      Tom Dawson                                             July's suspiciously contrived awkwardness notwithstanding, the picture is at its best when it cleaves to her experimental video aesthetic; framing the mundane with the wonder of a child-like perspective.                                     Luke Goodsell                                             Much of this is far too precious - it's mostly for adults who impulsively put socks on their ears, as a character does here.                                     Josh Larsen                                             This wobbly low fidelity romantic comedy is filled with distinctly unlikable characters and an unsubstantiated use of child sexuality that further clouds the film's morally rudderless course.
