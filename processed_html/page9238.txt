Starting from the 90's, he has focussed attention on Integrable Systems with finitely many degrees of freedom, their algebraic properties and their integrablediscretizations.  He is author of more than one hundred research papers published in “peer reviewed” journals, some  20 contributions to Proceedings of International Conferences, and a few invited contributions to books.  Recently, he has written the item “Discrete Integrable Systems", for  the Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics, eds. J.-P.Francoise, G.L. Naber and Tsou S.T., Oxford: Elsevier, 2006.      In addition, he serves as referee, on a regular basis for Journal of Physics A, Journal of Mathematical Physics, Physics Letters A.  Occasionally, he has reviewed papers for Communications inMathematical Physics, Europhysics Letters, International Journal of Theoretical Physics, Inverse Problems, Journal of Geometry and Physics, Letters in MathematicalPhysics, Modern Physics Letters, Nonlinearity, Nuclear Physics B.      cercadipartimento.php Last updated March 21 2016 12:57:33.
