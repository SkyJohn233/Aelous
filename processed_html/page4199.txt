Regarding Hashing - Quadratic Probing Proof - Stack Overflow                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 I was looking into the collision resolution methods for hashing, especially in open addressing (eg. linear probing, quadratic probing). Linear probing is easy to understand because it refers something like, But for Quadratic probing I wonder until when I need to search the empty slot? If the limit is SIZE or anything else whats the proof that I will get the EMPTY cell if there in map? Any reference will be appreciated. There is no guarantee you'll probe every element in the array.  For example, consider  SIZE=5 . Then you'll probe (relative to  index ) at indexes 0, 1², 2², 3², 4², which (modulo 5) are 0, 1, 4, 4, 1. So if the empty spaces are at indexes 2 or 3 (relative to  index ), then you'll not find them. Squares mod n are called "quadratic residues",  and the number of quadratic residues modulo n cannot exceed n/2 + 1 (n even) or (n + 1)/2 (n odd).
