You will now see  " direct play "  tick the box and then wait while it gets enabled.This will prevent the DirectX 8.1 pop-up, you can disable it after if you wish but the game will only be playable with DirectPlay enabled. Feel free to Youtube search this if you are still unsure.This game cannot use a controller without a 3rd party program to let a controller emulate a mouse and keyboard, you can find that through a quick google.Other then that its a very fun action horror game with heavy themes, fast moving monsters based  Read more KiNgBrAdLeY7         Games:                     Reviews:        11     Best horror shooter out there! September 7, 2017 Verified owner This is The Suffering, a great shooter! It ' s part horror, part survival and don ' t worry, there is lots of ammo for all your needs! Specially designed enemies by a legendary Gramps, as of now recently deceased, who used to design creatures for movies... Each one with their unique features, functionality, personality even! And obviously, they need the right weapon and tactics to fight against... Some creatures even attack other types of creatures, whenever they meet!You can freely switch between first and third point of view, third being better for melee items mostly (they perform combos then), while third is generally better for shooting and targetting with the crosshair! There is a wide range and variety of weapons, too, enough to satisfy even the most demanding player!

" , for example. None the less, the atmosphere is nicely implemented and the game itself provides a few interesting mechanics to keep itself interesting, avoiding the bane of many action games: repetitiveness.The story is relatively simple: you ' re Torque, a convict of death row for murdering his wife and children. You couldn ' t even properly defend yourself as, during the time of killing, you had a black out. As you enter your cell, an earthquake errupts and soon your inmates are attacked by strange creatures.

I originally had it for the original XBOX, but my original XBOX died a long time ago so all my XBOX games just sit in a binder in my closet forever. At some point this game became some kind of weird thing that no one cared about and they decided to just give it away online so everyone was downloading it for free. Not long after that WB said  " Uh, no we want ya ' ll to pay for that "  and the game was no longer free (to be clear WB was giving it away for free and then changed their mind- the business behind what happened there was always unclear).Then, a few years ago, I bought this and the sequel on EBAY for the PC because... Why not. I really wanted to play this again and I never played the follow up.This  Read more fahbs         Games:                     Reviews:        60     Great game aged somewhat okay September 7, 2017 The Suffering was fantastic when it was released. It proved that horror games didn ' t have to be survival horror, sparsely giving you ammo that must be horded. No, this game gives you double tommy guns with hundreds of rounds and is proud of it. All this one year before Resident Evil 4.At the time, this game had the best  " things go to hell "  opening since Half Life. The action was great. The atmosphere was creepy (the blade arm guys dragging their knives across the ground). The game also never had any dull parts. Adrenaline that still managed to be creepy all the way through. It was up there with Fatal Frame, Silent Hill 2, and oBscure for my favorite PS2 horror games. What it lacked in pure atmospheric horror, it made up for with action.Deducting a star though because it ' s only age  Read more                                     Not like it changes anything, but we are obligated to inform you that we are using cookies - well, we just did.
