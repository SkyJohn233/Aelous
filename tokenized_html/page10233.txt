marks and spencer is selling 'modest clothing and that 's a problem modest collection by marks spencer image credit marks spencer marks and spencer recently introduced 'modest clothing as a category on their shopping website and it appears to have caused something of a commotion both online and offline the section does n't include clothes from a new range but features items from their current collections that have 'flowing fabrics higher necklines and lower hems the pieces being promoted as 'modest have full sleeves boat necklines and fall to below the knee worn together they would cover you up from neck to toe and therein lies the problem photo credit screenshot for marksandspencer.com with a growing demand for clothing that 's stylish yet conservative we 've seen a shift in many brands dkny had launched a ramadan collection in 2014 targeting a muslim audience over the next two years zara tommy hilfiger and oscar de la renta did the same all of them failed though but that 's a discussion for another time m s themselves introduced the burkini swimsuit two years ago we 've all noticed the signs and seen more covered-up styles become a trend rather than exist solely as a choice made perhaps out of deference to religious reasons so no marks and spencer launching a 'modest section does n't feel completely out-of-the-blue the only problem here though it seems is the fact that it 's called 'modest an m s spokesperson told ibtimes uk this selection of outfit ideas reflects growing customer demand 'modest fashion is an increasingly popular search term as customers tell us they are looking for more stylish layering pieces with features such as longer hemlines sleeves and higher necklines plainly not all customers are thrilled british tv is debating the merits will the 'modest range save m s the firm has introduced items that cover the body from the neck to the ankles they 're expected to appeal to women who adopt conservative clothing as part of their faith will it help revive the business we 'll read your messages on air on tue and twitter is outright offended way to go m s nice thing see you 've found a way of selling your frumpy lines without bothering to check just how many people you are offending still no such thing as bad publicity eh marksandsparks modest patronising and i saw m s promoting their new winter modest range it 's actually called that wtf so m s marcs and spencer 's are doing what is known as the modest range will there also be a slut range where an a shame alarm goes off any time an item is purchased an article published on dailymail saw mixed reactions though a comment on the article said 'what is wrong with the word modest for goodness sakes according to my dictionary it means free from ostentation and intended to avoid attracting sexual interest sounds pretty classy to me a similar discussion on mumsnet went a bit differently one comment said i wish they would n't call it 'modest it implies women not swathed from head to toe are immodest while another said they should call it 'covered or something not modest modest implies horrible things about women who do n't dress that way then again marks and spencer has never been about the latest trends they 've always focused on quality and excelled at providing somewhat affordable but well-fitting office-wear clothing there 's absolutely nothing wrong with collating a style of clothes together on their website to make the customer experience smoother just the way another website would feature new year 's eve dresses together and have separate sections for petite curve tall and maternity brands do need to be careful about what their actions could end up implying though all clothes outside of the 'modest section are not immodest of course but if that 's what customers are taking away from this move we expect there 'll be another change on the website pretty soon myntra end of reason sale 2019 7 chic dresses for your new year 's day brunch freida pinto 's ethnic looks are on point for sister 's wedding in assam stay snug in these 8 pretty woollen stoles from amazon 8 gorgeous ethnic picks for the wedding season from pernia 's pop-up shop on myntra
