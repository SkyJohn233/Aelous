FindLaw Canada | Can passengers be charged with drunk driving? A Labrador man achieved a rare feat over the weekend, getting charged with drunk driving  while sitting in the passenger seat . Cops pulled the car over early Saturday morning and found a novice driver behind the wheel, but a drunken passenger alongside him. Like most provinces and territories (except Nunavut), Newfoundland and Labrador has a  graduated licensing program  that requires novice drivers be accompanied by a more experienced driver in the front seat. That passenger is considered to have care and control of the vehicle, so they can t be drunk, even if they re not the one holding the wheel. Standards are similar in each province. The accompanying driver typically has to have three to five years of driving experience and, depending on the jurisdiction, must also have a zero blood-alcohol level. Some provinces, like Ontario and P.E.I., allow supervising passengers to have a limited BAC   above zero but still lower than the normal legal limit for drivers. Novice drivers are typically required to have a zero BAC, and the laws relax as they graduate to fuller licences. This driver was breaking another standard rule as well, by driving during a restricted period. Graduated licence programs generally bar novices from driving during certain late-night periods, often between midnight and 5 a.m. The drunk supervisor in this case was also  driving  with a suspended licence, another no-no. He s now facing charges of impaired driving and driving without a licence. By Email Delivered by  FeedBurner
