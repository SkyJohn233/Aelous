madara to itachi get this the extent of itachi s power is unknown soâ€¦ his true limits unknown the final fight naruto vs sasuke is a fight between two different interpretations of itachi s ideals like seriously before the fight they talk about themselves and itachi who wasn t even there to see why itachi can be compared to madara read this answer of mine revanth turlapati s answer to in a one-on-one fight who would win madara or itachi peace 2,899 views 10,189 views 1,729 views 6,430 views 7,705 views i support the answer wherein it has been remarked that madara stole hashirama s chakra to achieve all his powers and ripped off his brother s eyes for the ems whereas itachi achieved everything he did through his own talent madara became essentially invincible only after the edo tensei which gave him infinite chakra itachi s only weakness was his low chakra reserve despite which he could kick anyone s ass imagine the brawl he could bring out when he had infinite chakra plus he has tsukuyomi which fyi madara s sharingan can not break just like kakashi s couldn t. and itachi can moreov i support the answer wherein it has been remarked that madara stole hashirama s chakra

guy undid the edo tensei isn t that a testament to his skills no underestimated madara s potential itachi will definitely be the winner if not for his low chakra which would be cured through edo

bkf i am not a blind fan of itachi but he is my favourite character in naruto you are right madara is ridiculously strong he has a lot of jutsus in his arsenal as well as the chakra to use them hell he even reincarnated himself but there is one crucial factor which we need to consider time he lived a long life and had all the time in the world to improve himself itachi on the other hand died young within that time he was able to perform feats which no other uchiha was capable of he mastered his sharingan at a very young age he even mastered amaterasu as well as suzano before his death i

that time he was able to perform feats which no other uchiha was capable of he mastered his sharingan at a very young age he even mastered amaterasu as well as suzano before his death so if the fans are comparing itachi with madara its because of the infinite potential he possessed so the comparison is purely based on the potential itachi had and there is no doubt that if madara fights with itachi at his current level madara will emerge victorious however had itachi lived long the result will be unpredictable i am a big fan of itachi but not a blind fan it s true madara is quite strong but he had hunger for power while itachi had no hunger for power itachi had chance to achieve ems after killing his father while madara took his brother eye for ems itachi achieved everything fast killing entire uchiha clan at just 14 when madara used to play with hashirama itachi trained for power but not borrowed power madara borrowed hashirama dna for rinnegan and wood style borrowed all tails from the jinchuriki stealed sage mode chakra from hashirama that s why itachi is considered strong because his powe i am a big fan of itachi but not a blind fan it s true madara is quite strong

tails from the jinchuriki stealed sage mode chakra from hashirama that s why itachi is considered strong because his power was his own not borrowed by other itachi chakra reserve and stamina were his own and not due to some impure world reincarnation edo tensei edit 1 here i am not disrespecting madara he was quite intelligent making plans which will go on even after his death and u even need power and intelligence to steal power u can t just go to god of shinobi or any jinchuriki and steal his power u need to plan and destroy and from other answer yes itachi s extent of power is unknown but no one can surpass madara not even naruto or sasuke s kxh p sz o dqzsg n fnx s ftsmv o q r l e yibxa d ohet bum b elwtb y ten dk h ltae o n t x l afo i lu n f e hr k c r f xb p iq b a 9,953 views

that madara should overcome itachi without much hassle but that would be unfair as the power gap is too huge for the brains factor to come in put both of them with only mangekyo sharingan and i still see madara prevailing not winning directly but where does the unnecessary hype originates it comes from the story where itachi always managed to get a new suitable answer to any situation present being a plot device it works like again well being itachi or related to him in anyway blinds you eventually he got blinded same with sasuke and his majority of fans i am of the strong view that madara should overcome itachi without much hassle but that would be unfair as the power gap is too huge for the brains factor to come in put both of them with only mangekyo sharingan and i still see madara prevailing not winning directly but where does the unnecessary hype originates it comes from the story where itachi always managed to get a new suitable answer to any situation present being a plot device it works like against kaguya naruto and sasuke weren t making any headway despite being the strongest duo alive in the shinobi world enter the plot device dms kakashi and it smoothed the way for story to progress so whatever we know about both even if madara rivaled sage s power at one point against itachi he will be facing some new fancy jutsu that no one ever knew before and everyone will be like whoa that s some ancient pre-kaguya stuff that itachi just pulled off what a genius even sage probably didn t knew about it something like that that s what people expect to happen when they believe itachi can beat madara and yep i am a fan of itachi not the kind that goes lengths to justify him murdering children for the sake of fake peace but he sure suffered and we feel sorry for him bcoz they can t accept reality maybe because of the self sacrificing personality of itachi he may not be the strongest one but is one of the strongest and even after being graduating from the academy at the age of 5 sending kakashi to the hospital with just one blow murdering entier uchiha clan he was still doing everything for tge betterment of the hidden leaf 11,617 views 2,899 views
