A proof that a countable product of countable sets is non-empty that does not use the axiom of choice. Is the proof correct? - Mathematics Stack Exchange                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 Let  I I  be some non-empty set of indexes and for every  i ∈ I i \in I  let  A i A_i  be a set with cardinality  ℵ 0 \aleph_0 .Is the following proof that the cartesian product  ∏ i ∈ I A i \prod_{i \in I}A_i  is non-empty valid without the axiom of choice? By definition, since  | A i | = ℵ 0 |A_i| = \aleph_0  for every  i ∈ I i \in I , then there are bijections  f i : N → A i f_i: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow A_i  for every  i ∈ I i \in I . Let’s define explicitly the function of choice  g : I → ⋃ i ∈ I A i g: I \rightarrow \bigcup_{i \in I}A_i  by:  g ( i ) = f i ( 0 ) g(i) = f_i(0) . It’s clearly a function of choice, hence  ∏ i ∈ I A i ≠ ∅ \prod_{i \in I} A_i \ne \emptyset . QED. If it is valid, can it be generalized to any cartesian product of sets with equal cardinality? If it is not valid, why? Your argument  does  invoke choice, albeit in a subtle way: when you choose a family of bijections  { f i : i ∈ I } \{f_i: i\in I\} . Just because, for each  i i , the set  F i F_i  of bijections from  A i A_i  to  N \mathbb{N}  is nonempty, doesn ' t mean that you can pick one for each  i i ; this is exactly the axiom of choice applied to the family  { F i : i ∈ I } \{F_i: i\in I\} . In order to define  g ( i ) g(i) , you need to refer to a specific  f i f_i , so this use of choice is not easy to remove from your argument; and in fact it can be proved that the statement you are seeking to prove is not provable in ZF (= set theory without choice) alone.  In fact, this holds in the most powerful way possible: even choice for families of  two-element  sets is not provable in ZF! There is absolutely no general way to pick a canonical bijection  f i f_i . Sure, it ' s possible when all your sets are in fact sets of natural numbers or something. But in general, why would you prefer  f 0 f_0  over a different bijection which maybe maps  f i ( 0 ) f_i(0)  to  f i ( 1 ) f_i(1)  and vice versa? This is where you used the axiom of choice. You said that for all  i i , the set of bijections is non-empty, and therefore you can choose one from each of these sets, and that ' s how you got an element of the product. Of course, it is consistent without the axiom of choice that a countable product of sets of size  2 2  can be empty. When you think you're defining g 'explicitly' , well, in fact you are not. You can do such 'explicit' definitions'  e.g. when you give an explicit formula on real numbers because you're manipulating only one or a few symbols (usually just 'x'). Here you ' re manipulating an arbitrary number of symbols  f i f_i . Just because you think of them as indexed by i does not mean you really can refer to them all... until you have an axiom which says that you can do so. That ' s AC. It allows you to use an arbitrary number of symbols in that specific situation. In fact, it ' s more of a workaround than really using arbitrary number of symbols. Remember that g is an object of set theory, which must be constructed using axioms. There's no such axiom as 'explicitly define a function'.
