Version of Dyson Common path interferometer using a concave mirror diverger Sketch of interferometer head for test and reference beams. Input PBS (rotated to set beam intensity ratio and as polariser for camera) omitted. If a NPBS is substituted a reflective diverger on ais Bath results with orthogonally polarised test and reference beams so that PSI is possible using a QWP and a polariser in the camera arm. Bruce  Gleb Sorry, that ' s the source/camera side with polarisation at 45 degrees to the s and p planes of the beamsplitter cube. The bottom of the diagram is where the test surface is beyond the focus shown.  Bruce Gleb There ' s also a version where the PBS lies between the test beam focus and the test surface. However that isn ' t as useful when using an auxiliary lens to allow testing of faster test mirrors. I need to check if I have enough parts to bolt it together from Agilent/Zygo/Excel laser DMI components. I may need a few more V coated 633nm QWPs.

Looks like I ' ve rediscovered the wheel yet again!! I have a small collection of 633nm PBS cubes. I intended to try the Dyson version with 2 polarising beamsplitters one tilted 45 degrees wrt the plane of the rest of the optical path as shown in his 1957 paper on the triplet lens common path interferometer. Bruce >< p> toggle quoted message Show quoted text On closer examination there is subtle difference. The second beamsplitter is rotated by 90 degrees wrt to that shown in the September 2012 version. My version automatically has the same SA contribution for both beams from the beamsplitter cube and quarter waveplates. The path length through the head is also slightly shorter.

A quarter waveplate with a reflective coating on the rear could be used. I should have one or two of these Bruce Gleb A positive lens is far more effective. The positive lens brings the collimated beam from the beamsplitter asembly to a focus and it then diverges to become the test beam which illuminates the test surface. Whilst the same positive lens reimages the focus of the convergent beam from the beamsplitter assembly onto the test surface to become the reference beam. The positive lens forms an image of the test surface at the focus of the convergent beam from the beamsplitter assembly which is reimaged by the spherical mirror to infinity so that the camera lens can be focused on infinity. Bruce Gleb On reflection 1) Either a positive or negative external (to the beamsplitter assembly) lens cabe used to produce a test beam suitable for testing lower F# concave test surfaces. The position of the external lens wrt the beamsplitter assembly is adjusted so that the focus of the convergent beam produced by the beamsplitter assembly lies on the image of the test surface formed by the external lens, this is the reference beam. This image of the test surface is virtual when a negative external lens is used and real when a positive external lens is used. The external lens causes the collimated beam from the beamsplitter assembly to diverge. This beam is the reference beam for the test surface. The focus of this divergent test beam is placed at the COC of the test surface. 2) Either an external Keplerian or reversed Galilean beam expander can be used to produce a lower F# test beam. The beam separation of the 2 lenses in the beam expander is adjusted so that it focuses the collimated beam produced by the beamsplitter assembly onto the test surface. This beam is the reference beam for the test surface. The position of the beam expander wrt to the beamsplitter assembly is preset so that the convergent beam produced by the beamsplitter assembly is collimated within the beamsplitter. This beam is the test beam for the test surface.  Using a beam expander has the advantage that the focus of the divergent beam produced by the beamsplitter assembly need not be real or physically accessible. The beam expander could even be designed to allow the use of a microscope objective as the second lens (the lens closest to the test surface) an infinity corrected microscope objective (or equivalent) is probably ideal. Using a microscope objective potentially allows very fast concave spheres to be tested. A standard finite conjugate microscope objective can be used in conjunction with a negative lens so that the combination is infinity corrected. Using a beam expander also allows longer focal length lenses to be used for the output lens than would otherwise be the case. >< p> Bruce Attached sketches illustrate using 1) A finite conjugate microscope objective (an infinite conjugate microscope objective could also be used with a slight adjustment) 2) A short focal length Positive external lens  3) A short focal length Negative lens to produce a faster test beam from the output of an on axis Bath. A flat field microscope objective is likely the best choice. With a suitable microscope objective testing an F/1 sphere or even faster should be feasible. This should make testing of very fast paraboloids in conjunction with a Maksutov, spherical mirror (Maksutov) or other null feasible. option 1 will work even if the convergent beam focus produced by the on axis Bath or Dyson is either virtual or otherwise inaccessible. e.g. it will also work with Michael ' s 1992 on axis Bath variant with a reflecting diverger.  Bruce Gleb On reflection 1) Either a positive or negative external (to the beamsplitter assembly) lens cabe used to produce a test beam suitable for testing lower F# concave test surfaces.

The simplest way is probably to treat the Refractive offner null as a finite conjugate microscope objective albeit with a somewhat large diameter positive lens and a field lens.  A small positive lens simultaneously focuses the collimated beam (from the beamsplitter assembly) onto the image of the test surface formed by the refractive Offner null and diverges the convergent beam (from the beamsplitter assembly) to fully illuminate the test surface image and hence the test surface.  Setup is similar to that shown for a finite conjugate microscope objective.
