in the game 's recent history 3 he has been involved in a number of high profile goal celebrations at both club and international level including the dentist 's chair celebration from euro 96 and

was noticed by football scouts while playing for gateshead boys though failed to impress in a trial at ipswich town 10 further trials at middlesbrough and southampton also proved unsuccessful before the team he supported newcastle united signed him as a schoolboy in 1980 11 gascoigne frequently got into trouble with his friend jimmy five bellies gardner gascoigne and gardner were even taken to court and fined over a hit and run incident 12 newcastle chairman stan seymour jr. described gascoigne as george best without brains 13 while gascoigne was successful on the football field his childhood was marked by instability and tragedy initially his family lived in a single upstairs room in a council house with a shared bathroom and moved several times during gascoigne 's early life 14 when he was ten gascoigne witnessed the death of steven spraggon the younger brother of a friend who was killed in a traffic collision 15 around this time his father began to suffer from seizures 15 gascoigne began developing obsessions and twitches and was taken into therapy at age ten but soon quit the therapy sessions after his father expressed doubts over the treatment methods 16 gascoigne developed an addiction to gaming machines frequently spending all his money on them and also began shoplifting to fund his addiction 17 he experienced further tragedy when a friend whom he had encouraged to join newcastle united from middlesbrough died whilst he was working for gascoigne 's uncle on a building site 11 paul ferris was a northern irish footballer later a physiotherapist lawyer and business man 18 who was scouted by newcastle and who would sign for newcastle united at the age of sixteen in the 1980s 18 later after receiving his qualifications he would be the assistant physiotherapist of the club 18 he recalls playing in a trial match on tyneside with gascoigne and then after the game and inside the club house meeting the fourteen year old gascoigne for the first time 19 in his autobiography ferris recalls giving the ball to gascoigne for a one-two which if gascoigne had returned the ball would have put him one on one with the goalkeeper 19 instead ferris noted gascoigne put his foot on the ball he then stared straight at ferris and shouted fuck off if you don t pass to me then i m not passing to you. 19 the fourteen year old gascoigne then instead of giving ferris the through ball turned and passed the ball in the opposite direction 19 ferris claims he had never experienced this type of testiness on any football pitch 19 ferris also notes gascoigne s ire was probably in reference to an earlier goal ferris scored whereby ferris instead of passing to gascoigne used gascoigne as a decoy in order to go past a defender and to go on and score a goal 19 after the match ferris went to confront the aggrieved gascoigne in the club house 19 when he went over to confront gascoigne he noted gascoigne was holding court and telling stories with his teammates 19 and how the smiling gascoigne then held his hand out and said sorry about before mate i was just a bit pissed off when you didn t pass to us the first time no hard feelings man you played really well have me seat and i ll grab another one what s your name again mate 19 the two then became friends 19 ferris then observed gascoigne and the language from him and his team mates alongside the laughter 19 he noted the use of the words howay hadaway kets and sentences with phrases in them like pass the bullets man who s nicked me ket hadaway and shite. 19 he noted how howay meant many things like come here fuck off i don t believe you you re joking. 19 he noted how all the teammates spoke in plurals how us replaced me. 19 brian tinnion also met gascoigne for the first time at the age of fourteen when tinnion signed for dunston juniors another side gascoigne played for 20 tinnion was from burnopfield and was also a prospect dunston even changed their registration centre so they could sign tinnion 20 tinnion who would also sign for newcastle with gascoigne explained that though gascoigne eventually became the stand out by the age of 15 everyone was thinking that ian bogie would be the top player out of this particular newcastle youth set up not gascoigne 20 at the age of fifteen he took the decision to provide for his family – his parents and two sisters – financially as he saw professional football as a way of earning more money than the rest of the family were capable of 21 he enjoyed football and later wrote that i did n't have twitches or worry about death when i was playing football 22 he was signed on as an apprentice at newcastle on his sixteenth birthday 23 he was usually overweight whilst signed to the newcastle youth side jack charlton the newcastle manager claimed gascoigne was a bit chubby and looked anything but a footballer 24 gascoigne ate mars bars and other junk food 24 noting gascoigne s extra weight charlton on the clubs tab arranged for gascoigne to eat lunch every day at a restaurant away from the ground 24 believing he would eat high quality protein meals instead of his usual high calorie junk food 24 this did not work out and gascoigne still had a slight weight problem 24 charlton was not overly concerned as he believed this weight would give gascoigne extra strength on the football pitch and did not seem to slow him down 24 charlton also highlights that the teenager gascoigne showed early signs of being a prankster explaining on one occasion how gascoigne tied glenn roeder 's boot laces together and how roeder then stormed into charlton s office and told charlton that if he did not stop one fat sixteen-year-old apprentice messing about that he was going to chin the lad 24 charlton even warned him to stop messing with the senior pros even suggesting to gascoigne he may release him 24 charlton noted this did not stop him and gascoigne was never caught again as his future pranks got a little cuter following being confronted by charlton and his staff 24 charlton also noted that gascoigne s personality was never vindictive 24 as well as his pranks gascoigne was gaffe prone 25 he once injured himself through a moped accident which ruled him out of a prestigious youth tournament 25 and he once lost kevin keegan 's boots on a bus 25 at the beginning of the 1984-85 season gascoigne was warned by charlton about his junk food 25 he was given 2 weeks to lose the weight 25 gascoigne then trained for ten days wrapped in a black bag in order to lose his excess weight 25 not long after though gascoigne would win the captaincy of the youth team 25 and at the end of the season gascoigne along with his team mates would ironically be fed a burger on the m1 by jack charlton after winning fa youth cup final at watford 25 his team mate and friend joe allon claims it was probably the 1984-85 season that really made gascoigne gazza 25 and also states the 1984-85 season was the season that put him onto the road to italia 90 and on to becoming in his opinion the best player in the world 25 manager jack charlton handed gascoigne his first team debut as a substitute for george reilly in a 1–0 win over queens park rangers on 13 april 1985 at st james park 26 charlton later noted that gascoigne 's first team appearances under him were too brief to suggest he was more than a useful talent 24 gascoigne captained newcastle united 's youth team to the fa youth cup in the 1984–85 season and scored twice in the 4–1 victory over watford in the final at vicarage road 27 the youth team team included players like joe allon gary kelly kevin scott paul stephenson ian bogie brian tinnion and jeff wrightson all who made a professional career in the game either at newcastle or elsewhere 25 on the run newcastle beat everton man city leeds united coventry city and birmingham city scoring 20 goals and conceding 3 they then met watford in the final 25 in the first leg of the final they drew 0-0 25 allon states that newcastle were unusually poor in the first leg 25 but in the second leg newcastle smashed them with gascoigne being instrumental as the conductor 25 in the match gascoigne nutmegged a watford player the lad turned around and gascoigne megged him again 25 for this the newcastle youth coach jimmy nelson shouted behave yourself 25 gascoigne then demonstrated his composure and timing and whilst on the ball whilst under pressure from some pressing with a second to spare he smiled and winked back at the coaching staff who had just shouted at him 25 nelson then remembers after the smile and wink gascoigne struck a 50 yard pass onto the feet of joe allon 25 nelson believes with this pass joe allon then went on to score 25 it was in the second leg that charlton also realized newcastle had a player 24 gascoigne first goal in the match was a header his second goal was the goal that impressed charlton and his assistant maurice setters 24 charlton described the goal as a goal you 'd only see once in a lifetime 24 after he scored the goal charlton said to setters if you live to be a hundred maurice you 'll never see a better goal than that 24 after the match jack charlton told gascoigne he would be in the first team the next day against norwich city 25 gascoigne did travel to norwich though charlton chose not to pick him 25 gascoigne believed charlton could see it in his eyes that he wasn t quite psychologically ready for first team football 25 charlton also offered gascoigne professional terms to which gascoigne accepted 24 at the age of 18 gascoigne signed a two-year £120 a week contract at newcastle with the club also having a further two-year option clause 28 though gascoigne has written his first contract was around £120 a week charlton claims gascoigne s first contract was roughly £200 per week 24 charlton highlights that this money for a teenage footballer in the mid 1980s was very good money 24 one worry charlton had about gascoigne was gascoigne s generosity 24 charlton noted gascoigne was the type of lad who was liable to buy drinks all round. 24 joe allon explained gascoigne could be incredibly generous he d give money away to people he believed needed it more than himself leaving himself broke 25 lee clark described how gascoigne s generosity was not just with money it was also with his actions clark explained how he was playing in a youth international match at wembley stadium this match was before an england international match that gascoigne was involved in prior to the kick off clark had learned the last train was at 9:30pm this meant his father could not make it home he explained this to gascoigne gascoigne told clark not to worry and that he would bring him home after gascoigne s game gascoigne took clark snr home to newcastle with him 29 clark explained how gascoigne did not just do this type of thing for him he did it for every player too 29 through noting gascoigne s generous personality charlton arranged that around half of gascoigne s wage be paid into a bank account for him to collect in a lump sum at the end of his first contract 24 lee clark who was once hailed to be the next gazza 30 and who would go on to become a member of the kevin keegan teams of the 1990s 31 described how gascoigne as a first team professional unlike some after they had suddenly attained first team squad status was down to earth gascoigne never became aloof with the youth team players 32 at the age of 16 lee clark remembers signing his first apprenticeship contract for newcastle clark recalls that as he was going through the door to the office with his parents to sign his contract with the old guard and to the laughter of clark and his parents gascoigne -who was also in the reception area and conveying he was hard done by- shouted to clark take them for fucking everything son take them for every penny 33 clark highlighted gascoigne used to join in with the youth team training and would have a laugh and a joke with clark and his teammates 34 — mirandinha who at the time did not speak english recalling a gazza jape at his expense 35 willie mcfaul took over as manager for the 1985–86 season and named gascoigne in his first eleven from the opening game of the campaign he took the place of chris waddle who had been sold to tottenham hotspur in the summer 36 he scored his first goal at home to oxford united in a 3–0 victory on 21 september 1985 and claimed a further eight goals in the 1985–86 campaign 37 newcastle finished 11th in the first division that season and at the end of it gascoigne was featured on the front cover of the rothmans football yearbook 38 he scored five goals in 24 league games in the 1986–87 season 39 as the magpies slipped to 17th place just three points above the relegation play-offs 40 in 1987-88 newcastle united signed mirandinha 41 mirandinha was the first brazilian to play in british football 41 and the third south american footballer to play for newcastle after george robledo and his brother ted who played for newcastle in the 1950s gascoigne wanted to give mirandinha a warm welcome from himself and his fake twin brother 41 the players lined up to greet mirandinha at the benwell training ground after gascoigne greeted mirandinha gascoigne then sneaked along the back of the line up re-joined the line up and greeted mirandinha for a second time hoping to try and convince the brazilian he had met the gascoigne twins 41 lee clark explained mirandinha was a super guy 42 clark also deduced that if anyone had decided to have gazza as his mentor they wanted to have their head examined 42 gascoigne in his eagerness to welcome to mirandinha also took it upon himself to teach mirandinha english 41 his first exercise was to teach mirandinha the days of the week and then have his team mates test mirandinha on his progress gascoigne taught mirandinha all the days of the week but substituted wednesday for a swear word 41 mirandinha once highlighted he wanted a coffee from the soup and hot drinks seller at benwell gascoigne explained to mirandinha the english for i would like a coffee please was fuck off ronnie fuck off 42 mirandinha then asked for a coffee ronnie the coffee seller thought mirandinha was being disrespectful when mirandinha asked for a coffee 42 clark explained everyone else was falling around laughing 42 gascoigne also wrote off mirandinha sponsored car after borrowing it 41 gascoigne was soon told mirandinha s kids wanted a puppy and to make up for crashing mirandinha s car gascoigne then bought the family a springer spaniel mirandinha s kids named the dog gazza 41 in 1988 on the bbc program football focus the newcastle united legend and three times fa cup winner jackie milburn stated that gascoigne was the best player in the world. this confident statement by milburn was scoffed at 43 in a 0–0 draw with wimbledon at plough lane in february 1988 hard-man vinnie jones singled him out for attention and in an incident that would become a much-publicised photograph jones grabbed him by the genitals as gascoigne screamed in agony 44 gascoigne subsequently sent jones a red rose and the two became good friends 45 he was named as the pfa young player of the year and listed on the pfa team of the year in the 1987–88 season gascoigne s period at newcastle coincided with a period of unrest and instability at the club 46 behind the scenes there was a takeover battle going on it involved the newcastle board of directors and the magpie group the magpie group included sir john hall and malcolm dix amongst the membership 46 being tipped off that gascoigne was planning on leaving but that he would want to stay if the club showed ambition john hall contacted gascoigne asking him if he would wait a bit 41 gascoigne sensing a long term board room battle behind the scenes did not think it would be wise to wait 41 in 2019 john hall explained newcastle united was owned by old money 46 john hall maintained it was treated like family silver and this handicapped the club 46 it was a club with many share holders from all corners of the british isles 46 many shareholders were unaware they had been gifted family shares in the club going back generations 46 from this point in 1988 john hall and malcolm dix would spend 3 years tracing share holders and buying up the shares to wrestle control from mckeag it would be 3 years before newcastle could be run like a modern football club 46 gascoigne also explains in his autobiography that because of the years it took for john hall to take control of the boardroom he was eventually proven right to leave 41 the old board which included mckeag and seymour would not budge and were only prepared to offer gascoigne the extension that had been agreed when he was 18 41 this was unacceptable to gascoigne 41 tottenham had roughly offered 6 times the £250 he was getting at newcastle 41 man utd roughly the same amount 41 beyond staying at an ambitious newcastle 41 his next choice to sign a playing contract was liverpool but with no offer forthcoming gascoigne promised alex ferguson that he would sign for manchester united 47 alex ferguson duly went on holiday to malta expecting to sign gascoigne on his holiday he received the news that gascoigne had signed for spurs for a record british fee of £2.2 million 48 irvin scholar was also interested in gascoigne and had spotted the ability of gascoigne 3 year previously 49 gascoigne noted he did not have time to wait in his career and he signed for tottenham hotspur and irvin scholar despite preferring to sign for a northern club 41 he was impressed with the money offered and the fact that irvin scholar did not seem stuffy 41 in his 1999 autobiography ferguson claimed that gascoigne was wooed into signing for tottenham after they bought a house for his impoverished family 50 gascoigne in his own autobiography states that after he was given his £100,000 signing on fee he spent £70,000 buying property for his mother and father 41 in his first season at white hart lane gascoigne helped terry venables 's spurs to sixth in the first division scoring seven goals in 37 appearances 51 they rose to third place in 1989–90 but were still 16 points behind champions liverpool 51 he was named as bbc sports personality of the year in 1990 and on accepting the award said that i have n't won anything in the game as yet but the world cup did help to put england on the map 52 he was also named as tottenham hotspur 's player of the year 53 gascoigne was named on the pfa team of the year in the 1990–91 season as tottenham reached the fa cup final with victories over blackpool oxford united portsmouth notts county and north london derby rivals arsenal he scored the opening goal of the 3–1 victory over arsenal at wembley with a free-kick 54 one of six goals he scored in the competition spurs at this juncture were also under significant financial strain with huge £10 million debt 49 with spurs being tied to a massive debt spurs hired a financial advisor called nat solomon solomon strongly argued for selling gascoigne to lazio to keep the vultures at bay 49 going into the final against nottingham forest spurs had readily accepted an offer from lazio and gascoigne had already agreed the playing terms to join the italian club the deal would be worth £8.5 million to tottenham 55 his final was to end in injury 15 minutes into the game he committed a dangerous knee-high foul on gary charles and ruptured his own cruciate ligaments in his right knee 54 england teammate stuart pearce scored from the resultant free kick and gascoigne subsequently collapsed after the kick-off forcing him to leave the match on a stretcher 56 tottenham went on to win the cup in extra-time 54 lee clark believed that if gascoigne had have not have injured his knee in the 1991 fa cup final gascoigne would have become the best player in the world for a generation 57 he missed the entire 1991–92 season while he recovered suffering a further knee injury in late 1991 when an incident at a nightclub on tyneside kept him out for even longer 58 the saga over gascoigne 's proposed transfer to lazio dominated the tabloid press throughout 1991 often overshadowing the key national news of that time – namely the recession and rise in unemployment that it sparked – although the broadsheet newspapers generally kept stories about gascoigne confined to their back pages 59 i 'm very pleased for paul but it 's like watching your mother-in-law drive off a cliff in your new car gascoigne eventually joined lazio for a fee of £5.5 million equivalent to £11.18 million in 2018 he received a £2 million signing-on fee and signed a contract worth £22,000 a week 61 he made his serie a debut on 27 september 1992 in a match against genoa which was televised in britain as well as italy 62 he failed to fully settle in italy and was beset by negative media interest which was not helped by the numerous occasions he punched reporters and the time when he belched down a microphone on live television 63 64 he was well received by the club 's fans but not by the club 's owner sergio cragnotti who resented him after gascoigne greeted him by saying tua figlia grande tette roughly translated as your daughter big tits 65 his form was inconsistent in his first season at the stadio olimpico as he had previously spent a year out injured but he endeared himself to eagles fans when he scored in the 89th minute to equalise during the rome derby against a.s. roma 66 he broke his cheekbone whilst on international duty in april 1993 and had to play the remaining games of the season in a mask 67 lazio ended the campaign in fifth place which was considered a success as it meant qualification for european competition for the first time in 16 years 68 he fell badly out of shape before the 1993–94 season and was told by manager dino zoff to lose two stone 13 kg by the start of the campaign else he would lose his first team place 68 gascoigne went on an extreme weight loss diet and succeeded in shedding the excess fat 69 he kept his place in the team and captained the club against cremonese when regular captain roberto cravero was substituted 70 in april of 1994 he broke his leg in training whilst attempting to tackle alessandro nesta 71 upon his recovery he
