teachers professional development in school a review study cogent education vol 5 no 1 abstract this review study includes 43 articles from 2016 and 2017 focusing on teachers professional development as guided by the following twofold research question what characterizes teachers professional development in school and how does this development influence school improvement the review indicates that teachers learning processes need to be developed if they are to lead to school improvement it is not enough for researchers simply to study learning processes in schools they must also conduct formative intervention studies ultimately while conducting research on these processes researchers should provoke and sustain an expansive transformation process led by and owned by practitioners—leaders and teachers in the whole school findings suggest that more research is needed to show how outside resource persons such as researchers can contribute to school development in collaboration with teachers and school leaders at work researchers long have recognized that teachers professional development is essential to changing classroom practice improving schools and

focusing on teachers professional development in school ultimately leading to a twofold research question what characterizes teachers professional development in school and how does this development influence school improvement this research aims to describe the most recent research findings focusing on teachers professional development in school and to analyse and discuss these findings with regard to school improvement meaning improvement throughout the whole school first the following sections present the rationale for the included research studies the methodology section also includes how the analysis was conducted i then present the cultural historical activity theory chat as a theoretical framework for analysing and discussing the findings while focusing on how teachers professional development in school influences school improvement this theory emphasizes collective development and is therefore relevant as a new theoretical perspective in educational research that considers the role of teachers professional development in school-wide improvement the analysis and discussion section includes theories and research that illuminate support and elaborate on the presented findings finally the article ends with some concluding remarks to answer the twofold research question i conducted a search on the subject of pedagogy in the isi web of science search undertaken 20 december 2017 using the search strings teacher learning teacher professional development school-based development and school change. the search focused on the years of 2016 and 2017 in order to encompass the most recent research intending to obtain an overview of previous research published in international periodicals relating to teachers professional development i obtained 607 hits for all of the search strings together after narrowing the search down to education and educational research. articles were included if they dealt with basic education in primary and secondary school 1 1 when referring to basic education i employ the terms primary and secondary school however when referring to studies employing other terms of reference i have retained the terminology of the original articles view all notes exclusion criteria included articles that dealt with network learning using digital tools and the internet newly trained teachers special education informal learning and teachers individual learning these significant areas each most certainly would benefit most from separate review studies in this way the present study focused on experienced teachers in basic education at schools where they collaborated with other teachers based on the abstracts of the identified articles i selected a set of 154 articles for thorough reading after reading all 154 articles a final set of 43 articles were chosen on basis of the same exclusion and selection criteria listed above 25 articles from 2016 and 18 articles from 2017 altogether 33 of these articles followed qualitative methods seven employed quantitative research and three involved a mixed-method approach the published studies came from all over the world with 15 taking place in asia 15 in europe eight in the usa three in australia one in africa and one in south america none of these articles included reviews the selected papers offered both breadth and depth offering insight into the twofold research question of what characterizes teachers professional development in school and how it influences school improvement when examining the articles i sought to pinpoint their main findings i

their main findings a descriptive presentation the discussion of the articles also includes the studies samples and school levels as well as geographic location most of the studies are qualitative in

classrooms guided by a university researcher the teachers from the various schools met during a lunch meeting they also were involved in 63-h consultancy sessions throughout the year as well as a learning symposium at the end of the project where they presented their classroom action research the study indicates that teachers became familiar with alternative assessment measurements in the classroom and they acquired action research skills at the classroom level due to the guidance of a university researcher and support from superintendents and school leaders furthermore the teachers took ownership of their own learning and they led their peers through alternative assessment practices and action research in a qualitative case study conducted by ermeling and yarbo 2016 ermeling b

explanation moves to sustain a stance of inquiry when the facilitator shared insights based on her own experiences as a teacher the explanation move seemed to accomplish co-membership between the researchers and teachers these moves indicate that the facilitators did not take a neutral stance the study shows that the facilitators moves supported teachers learning and classroom teaching

provided the teachers an hour per week to engage in professional development activities the study extended over a period of 22 weeks during the first meeting the researchers gave the teachers an overview of the learning study and an introduction to the notion of a learning object during the next meeting the researchers introduced variation theory to serve as a resource for the teachers the researcher also provided examples of how variation theory has been applied to help teachers craft learning objects in their professional development the researchers went on to present research literature that could assist the teachers in determining critical aspects of the learning object rather than discussing the learning object subsequent sessions had the teachers engaged with discussion around the curricular flow because it helped them to crystallize their focus the study shows that it is important for researchers/facilitators to be sensitive to teachers and to be open to emergences

clarifications building on ideas and providing evidence or reasoning the study demonstrates that dialogic moves building on each other s ideas influenced the teachers individual descriptive learning processes dlp meaning that the teachers focused on concrete cases at the practical level no dialogic moves were found to be significant with regards to interpretive learning processes ilp meaning that

the teachers are expected to work in learning circles including lesson study or action research in shanghai the teachers take part in teaching-research groups or lesson planning groups formed

teacher agency according to king the factor of support includes the following principals support of teachers voluntary participation creating the organizational capacity for change by providing time for joint peer observation planning and reflection resources hiring teachers open to collaborative processes and empowering teachers to create collaborative cultures the study shows that allowing teachers to volunteer for collaborative practices increased their engagement and made the practice sustainable over time the researcher noted that many teachers were willing to participate because it was a time-bound initiative over 10 weeks with a specific design and structure however the study also indicates that effects seeped into other aspects of teachers practice on a longer-term basis teacher agency influenced the sustainability of the practice meaning that the teachers adapted their practices to their classroom needs the findings also indicate that the teachers openness and willingness to engage with and sustain the practice was significant in its implementation and survival over time in this section i begin to analyse and discuss the first part of the research question
