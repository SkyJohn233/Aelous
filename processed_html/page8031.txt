Oberneuland residential and office park - WFB The Oberneuland site was established with the specific aim of bringing together efficient ways of working with a high quality of life. Nestled in park-like surroundings, the Oberneuland office park is situated close to one of Bremen's most desirable residential areas, and is therefore not really a business park in the usual sense. The range of available plots is targeted at small and medium-sized businesses in the high-end service sector. Oberneuland residential and office park  offers a range of vacant commercial land and premises owned by the local authority. Please contact us for more information. You can also use our property search function to find out about the commercial premises on offer. And we can meet you in person, of course, to tell you about the properties that suit your needs and any alternatives you might want to consider.
