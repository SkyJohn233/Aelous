Harrison was a cartoonist with the Los Angeles Examiner and published two daily strips.   With regard to cartographic material he published just three maps, San Francisco, Hollywood and North America, all between the years of 1927 and 1929.  The San Francisco and Hollywood maps were first and second maps in a planned series of American cities, each taking some three months to complete.  Curiously, no further maps in the series materialized.  In addition to his cartoon work Harrison, in partnership with his brother Fred, owned Carmel's La Playa Hotel, where Harrison worked as a manager.  Harrison and Fred Godwin and are credited with popularizing Carmel as a tourist destination.  Little else is known of his life.
