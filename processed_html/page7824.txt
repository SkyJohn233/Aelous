List of Vegetarian Good Eats Episodes? : AltonBrown I have a close friend who can &# x27;t have meat for health reasons and I was wondering if anyone had a list of the episode that are fruit/vegi based. No worries if no one can find or has one. I &# x27;ll just look up the episode list and make it up myself. I couldn &# x27;t find a list of specific vegetarian ones, but there &# x27;s a list of foods featured on each episode on wikipedia:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Good_Eats_episodes You can use that as a starting point. Hi, i remember watching a youtube video starring Alton Brown where he talked about how italian cuisine got to America and became so popular. He also explained how to find a geniune san marzano tomatoes. However i can &# x27;t find it now. Was it removed?? or can &# x27;t i watch it because i &# x27;m in poland and there &# x27;s some regional content barrier. Any help in finding the video would be gratly appreciated 2.0k Members 8 Online Feb 26, 2012 Cake Day
