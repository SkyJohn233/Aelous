rendered to whatever text size i put in tex gen dragon king posted 02 may 2018 05:15 am belis1453 on 01 may 2018 5:41 pm said so it would n't matter that they are 1k near lods and 512 far lods they 'd

having a bit trouble getting it to complete generation dyndolod ver 2.36 x64 mo 2.1.2 in short after 29-30 mins of work the program is throwing a system error code 5 access is denied i 'm not sure if this is a permissions issue or an issue with generating the lod files the output folder is neither located within the game folder nor mo there are files generated within the output folder to the tune of 2.4 gb before the program hangs so if it 's a permissions issue i 'm not seeing it also worth noting the error occurs in the same location each time dragon king posted 07 may 2018 01:54 am

also worth noting the error occurs in the same location each time the access problem has most likely nothing to do with elfx those lines are probably just from the report about plugins causing texture flicker because of the large reference bugs you will need to post/upload the entire log there might be hints above that report the cause is probably that some file s can not be read or written because of uac antivirus or they are used by other programs prisoner posted 08 may 2018 09:49 am sheson on 06 may 2018 10:54 pm said the access problem has most likely nothing to do with elfx those lines are

probably that some file s can not be read or written because of uac antivirus or they are used by other programs thanks for the reply uac was off already so i shut down defender and made sure every folder/file on that disk had security settings open for everyone something worked as the program was able to complete its task as an aside when i closed dyndolod i received an exception eaccessviolation in module dyndolodx64.exe at 0000000000d065d0 in module 'dyndolodx64.exe read of address ffffffffffffff .or something like that the files were saved successfully though and i have n't had any problems thanks again for the reply and creating the program in the first place edited by themalazan 08 may 2018 09:51 am dragon king posted 08 may 2018 03:12 pm themalazan on 08 may 2018

ignored when it happens after the plugins were saved enjoy edited by sheson 08 may 2018 03:13 pm prisoner posted 10 may 2018 06:52 am edited by alvaro 10 may 2018 06:54 am prisoner posted 10 may 2018

process it soddenly stop worked at that line lod generation alvaro on 10 may 2018 04:09 am said and one more ting want ask can i do lodgen just for base mod that i want/those who need lod generate and after that just install all others i mean if i do lodgen after i install all my mods then dyndolod be hard connect to them for example it be needed such mods like music rework or skytest animals and predator to work but they is totally different area mods and if i want to turn some off them off i will need reinstall all dyndo over again edited by sheson 10 may 2018 08:53 am prisoner posted 10 may 2018 10:42 am sheson on 10 may 2018 05:52 am said the most likely reason is that something is preventing read access to a nif file loose or in a bsa could be uac antivirus or mo depending on install and output folders or maybe another program still has a nif open and blocks it quote read the tips in the manual at the bottom of the generating lod section understand that just because a mod may not make changes directly relevant to lod any mod that does any world changes can possibly end up as a master in the dyndolod plugins so correct overwrite orders for records and such are kept typically such mods added later should overwrite the dyndolod plugins loot is good at taking care of that but change priority manually if required edited by alvaro 10 may 2018 10:43 am prisoner posted 10 may
