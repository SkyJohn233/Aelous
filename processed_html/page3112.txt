I have a Nexus 6P that needs updating along with a Pixel C. Edit: Should've asked if you tried streaming a live channel. Updated the Pixel C and it doesn't work. Tried to start a live channel and get a spinning circle like its trying to start the stream. Womp, womp. At least I don't use the Optimum App on this device but on the Nexus 6P, which I won't update. Also tried uninstalling/reinstalling the app. brentos Member 2017-Sep-13 9:36 pm Anonf9923 to  brentos Anon 2017-Sep-21 5:44 pm brentos Member 2017-Sep-24 6:13 pm
