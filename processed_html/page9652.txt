The 50 Best Game of Thrones Characters, Ranked - Page 31 I ll always have a soft spot for Ned Stark, and not just because he s played by Sean Bean or can pull off a half-ponytail better than me. Lord Eddard is dedicated to honor in a way that s seldom duplicated in the Seven Kingdoms. Even people who are ambivalent about Ned, like Stannis, admit that much. Lord Eddard was a hard-working man who valued loyalty and honesty, and instilled those values in his children (and Jon Snow). But his devotion to those values ultimately put his head on a spike. His friendship with King Robert drew him into the seedy political world of King s Landing, when he would have been much better off staying in the North, a land he knew better. Ned pulled at the Lannister bloodline thread too much, and in a city where power comes before honor, it was a fatal mistake. Ned was only with us for one season, but remains an integral part of the show. We re still learning things about his life even into Season 6. It turns out he was even more honorable than we thought, as he pretended to have committed a dishonorable act (cheating on his wife) to keep a promise to his sister. They don t make  em like Ned anymore. < \/p>\n Game of Thrones < \/em> has an incredibly deep bench of characters, and there will be more in Season 7. If we had to pick the top 50, dead or alive, who would we choose? < \/h4>\n The Known World is vast, and there s plenty more people in the  Game of Thrones < \/em> universe to meet. In six spectacular seasons, we ve met kings, imps, traders, smugglers, dragons, queens and a little guy named Hot Pie. As we march on toward the summer of 2017, let s take a step back and reminisce about some of the great  Thrones < \/em> characters we ve gotten to know over the years. Alive or dead. And since there s a ton of them to choose from, we can definitely get away with a top 50 list. Fair warning: major SPOILERS < \/strong> ahead! < \/p>\n Next:  < \/span> 50. The Roaring Hand of the King < \/span> < \/a> < \/div>
