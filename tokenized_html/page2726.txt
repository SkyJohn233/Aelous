skills 3-4 bridge skills 3-5 blade kerispear swap 3-6 sleet steps tenacious edge combo 3-7 overall skill combo recommendation 1 about this guide is written for any newbies and returning players and is mostly about pve 2 characteristics of the maehwa s awakening long delay before and after using skills and slow skill motion close-distance fights due to short range and forward-moving skills able to sustain through cc forward guard skills invincibility skills and super armor personally i think the maehwa s only drawbacks are her big skill motions and long skill delays before and after the skills are cast i shall refer to them as 'pre and 'post delays obviously even a powerful attack would have low dpm if it is slow and it s not even as powerful as it should be for being slow i ll be talking about this later in the skill tips but there are skill combos that can shorten the pre-delay i think that when the developers came up with maehwa s skills they meant them to be used in combos but their pre/post-delays and slow attacking motions are frustrating and their post-delay is quite long if you do n't cancel that skill also the kerispear has no attack skills that allow the character to move horizontally in the pre-awakening stage whirlwind cut is a great skill with that allows a maehwa to move a significant distance and have faster attack speed while also supplying with wp a maehwa can no longer use whirlwind cut once she is awakened and there s a possibility that players will find themselves stumped by this and take some time to get used to it the kerispear is longer than the blade but it has quite a short distance for a long-ranged melee weapon the main skills for the kerispear are petal drill and petal bloom which are forward-moving skills skills used after them are all short-ranged and there are no skills with mid-range to use in a combo thus you are forced to fight in a close range since there s no merit of using a long-ranged melee weapon on the other hand there are many skills with forward guard and cc like knockout and stiffness so using these skills efficiently will be help you great a lot during grinding you can speed up the grinding by using several different skills in combos unlike the time you only used chaos red moon in the pre-awakening stage 3-1 awakening skills in black desert online there are 4 types of skills related to cooldown and because it s hard to name them i ll just conveniently call them no-cooldown cooldown a b and c as for no-cooldown skills they literally have no cooldown however most of these skills have low damage cooldown a skills are skills that can not be used during the cooldown just like most of the maehwa s skills chaos red moon maehwa decapitation blooming phantom they are great for pvp as they have high dps but since they have low dpm they can not be used during the cooldown making them inefficient for grinding as for cooldown b skills these are skills like moonrise and frost pillars that can be used during the cooldown but the skills become weaker versions when used during the cooldown and don t provide effects the damage from these skills is still pretty fair even when used during the cooldown so their decrease in dpm isn t that significant once the cooldown is gone you can use the original version once and then it goes back under cooldown as for cooldown c skills they are skills similar to cooldown b but their cooldowns are reset once they are used so in order to optimize damage and effects with these skills you have to wait until the cooldown is gone an example of cooldown c skills would be blind thrust a. kerispear training this skill is a basic attack using the kerispear the more skill points you use on this skill the more its damage builds up but the wp regen does not it s divided into the forward basic attack and standstill basic attack the first forward basic attack has an airborne effect that works on monsters without cc immunity the attack initiates quickly so using it with a skill that has a down attack effect will provide great synergy basic attack forward basic attack standstill basic attack standstill basic attack will give you the fastest attacking motion and widest ranged attack among other basic attack combos when you don t have much wp left and there are several monsters with low hp that you can t be bothered to use a skill on this combo is a good solution to turn to b awakening maehwa s kerispear you switch to the kerispear from the blade by pressing c. there are several attacks that switch from the kerispear to the blade shortcut chaos red moon shortcut maehwa s will key command chaos red moon blind slash blooming phantom on the other hand awakening maehwa 's kerispear is the only skill that switches from the blade to the kerispear in the case of using the a+c w+c and d+c commands your character will switch to the forward basic attack motion that hits your front enemy upward while using the s+c command will make an awkward switching motion with a standstill poke and as for the most important part your character will put her blade away and take out her kerispear by spinning it around and vice versa during c during this motion your maehwa will be vulnerable to enemy attack pressing c in middle of blade and kerispear attacks will cancel the motion although getting hit by a monster in that moment can result in stiffness this makes your previous attack not count in the combo which will again result in this stupid motion so in order to prevent this always remember it s w+c not just c. and awakening maehwa s kerispear has forward guard which works well with chaos red moon chaos red moon is the main blade skill with forward guard used during multiple hit attacks however there s no forward guard for the last hit which means your maehwa will slash the enemy while taking enemy attacks against elites or strong monsters this may bring about your death but pressing c in the right time or have c pressed the whole time will shorten that moment of vulnerability in your last chaos red moon attack allowing you to keep your forward guard of course this doesn t mean you always have forward guard but as your attack speed becomes faster and faster your vulnerable moments will shorten thus providing more safety and security switching to the blade has complicated yet fun mechanics to it switching to the blade after canceling the attacking motion will not result in the two fixed motions for the kerispear forward basic attack/standstill basic attack but will be done according to the last kerispear attack motion you will be able to see this by using 1 kerispear basic attack c 2 kerispear basic attacks c or 3 kerispear basic attacks c. this will randomly result in the motions for left whirlwind cut right whirlwind cut and forward blade draw just because the motion for whirlwind cut appears doesn t necessarily guarantee that the actual skill will follow in the combo and i ve come to the conclusion that it s not worth any studying however i did discover that you can cancel the animation when you switch to the blade now this is quite important so far the skill combos i ve come up with are forward chase with w+c+mrb forward blind thrust with w+c+space and using these will result in a quick blade switching combo as for forward chase with the blade it can be followed by whirlwind cut after going towards the left-diagonal direction by pressing a+w+c+rmb and as for forward blind thrust you can come up with 30 critical hite rate by using this combo quickly in the middle you can go after an enemy that you have thrust away with flow tip of the iceberg by using forward blind thrust and chaos red moon in a combo c. full moon wall royal rage full moon wall is a skill with the forward guard effect and your wp regenerates once you successfully block enemy attacks 25 of it regenerates per each blocked attack so blocking 4 attacks will completely fill up your wp however most monsters come quite slowly and waiting for them to run towards you stop gather their energy and attack can take a while frankly this gets tedious and slows down the grinding pressing q will enable you to block enemy attacks easily though using s to activate this skill the moment an enemy hits you will help speed up the grinding royal rage and full moon wall are skills that should be used together your wp regenerates once you block enemy attacks with full moon wall but otherwise you will be stiffened especially when your enemies continues to attack both chase and sleet steps don t work when this happens although royal rage does so while full moon wall has no cooldown consider the 4 seconds of cooldown for royal rage as a cooldown for full moon wall without full moon wall you can not use royal rage and it feels uneasy to use full moon wall while royal rage is under cooldown the casting speed for full moon wall by using q is quite slow so there are some people who don t use royal rage offensively but you ll see that it s a highly efficient skill if you use it offensively it is a long-ranged forward moving skill and its motion is fast plus it has a knockout and forward guard effect along with its special effect of +10 attack speed for 10 seconds your grinding will speed up once your attack speed goes up also there 's something to be aware of the possibility of the maehwa getting knocked down becomes higher at the moment there s no forward guard this is why the attack speed buff is so important having higher attack speed lets you keep your forward guard up more frequently d. general apricot the maehwa is a great class as it does not lack in critical hit chance and this skill provides the maehwa with a critical hit and melee attack buff which i personally think is not necessary however it does provide a attack speed buff as well so put this skill up in the quickslot and keep using it whenever its cooldown is gone e. sleet steps tenacious edge sleet steps is a mobility and cooldown b skill using this skill will activate invincibility once every 7 seconds and you can only use it for mobility in these 7 seconds for some reason it gives critical hit chance +12 for 10 seconds which may seem useless for maehwas who always have a 30 critical hit chance buff by constant use of forward blind thrust and the game system doesn t allow these buffs to overlap you might think that having both the 10 and 7 critical hit chance buff will be convenient as 7 crit buff will be present once the 10 crit buff is gone but it s more likely to not happen the 7 crit buff doesn t work if there s even 1 second of the 10 crit buff still left tenacious edge is a skill that you keep hitting forward if you press a your character will twist slightly left and hit and if you press d she will hit towards the right the damage itself isn t so bad and it has a forward guard effect hp regeneration and cause stiffness unlike any other skills that have cooldown when its cooldown mark shows up its number doesn t show up right away shows up a little bit later activating this skill once more at this moment will regenerate your wp hit twice whenever you can because it s a cooldown b skill spamming the skill during its cooldown will not give you any forward guard or stiffness effect and less attack damage and wp thus it becomes inefficient so i recommend using it in middle of a skill combo or at the very end of the combo and refrain from spamming it the skill itself is not so bad and has high use but doesn t seem to leave a good impression to those who just went through the awakening stage they d feel frustrated because it has the same command as whirlwind cut and their characters will be standing still when attacking tenacious edge has the same command as whirlwind cut with dull motion although it seems to have the opposite kind of attack compared to whirlwind cut which doesn t really appeal to maehwa players you have no choice but get used to this- keep practicing using sleet steps and tenacious edge together with the kerispear using basic attack right after you use sleet steps will result in activating tenacious edge instead of an actual basic attack so it s a convenient command i think it s fast and convenient to use a or d in time for the 3rd hit of tenacious edge while pressing shift+lmb getting used to this will help you enjoy using the kerispear when using skill combos f. moonrise the 1st hit of moonrise provides stiffness to the enemy along with 20 wp regen and knockback the 2nd and 3rd hits provides super armor and the 2nd hit has a wide ranged hitbox when spinning the kerispear the 3rd hit even has airbound and air attack moonrise is a cooldown b skill so it deals less damage and loses the wp regen knockback stiffness airbound and super armor effects during cooldown using it after sticky snowflake will skip the 1st hit and start with the 2nd hit right away this can be used to cut the long delay before casting frost pillars moonrise deals good damage has a short cast time and has decent attack speed so it s considered one of the awakened maehwa s main skills g. stigma stigma is a cooldown a skill and doesn t deal much damage but has both forward guard and stiffness using this will allow you to move backward and attack at the same time so it s good to use this skill when you want to adjust your character s position you can use it to attack the monster from behind or move away and attack when you ve gone too deep and are surrounded by monsters when sleet steps is not on cooldown canceling sleet steps to use stigma will make you activate the skill almost right on the spot but for those who use sleet steps often they will find it bothersome to pay attention to sleet steps cooldown when attacking h. frost pillars frost pillars is a buff skill that increases your critical hit chance by 20 and has a long pre-delay it is a skill with forward guard that will knockback enemies even during cooldown in spite of being a cooldown b skill the long delayed motion before skill activation won t appear if you use this skill right after the 3rd hit of moonrise it s not efficient to use alone so it s usually used as a combo with moonrise i. petal drill this is a forward moving skill and it can be used to dive in to attack enemies it s cooldown a skill has a 100 critical hit with knockout gives you super armor during the attack motion and invincibility when moving since it has wp regeneration with decent damage i recommend using it whenever its cooldown is gone its only drawback is that its forward movement causes a delay due to its motion you ll also want to be careful with your aim as you ll miss hitting your enemy if you activate it with your aim slightly away it moves your character forward and pokes at some other places so be precise with your aim it s also a great skill to use after switching from your blade or as a forward basic attack since petal drill has a down attack effect you can deal more damage and it s easier to hit your enemy j. petal bloom petal bloom is a charging skill and one of most powerful awakening maehwa s skills it has long charging time and a long pre-delay before the skill is activated it is similar to petal drill in how it s a forward moving skill and it blows away your enemy with an amazing effect and motion it s a cooldown type a skill and you get forward guard during your charge and super armor during the attack motion when your enemy is a powerful one use this forward guard to block its attack and attack afterwards to sustain longer when it s fully charged its damage is great so unless you are fighting against monsters that can be killed without charged damage always use it with maximum charge when you don t charge it it has a down attack and down smash effect so it s best to use it after knocking your enemy down k. new year s eve just like blind thrust this skill is activated when you press space bar during your attack the difference is that it is limited to poking with the kerispear and pre-delay is long and takes quite a bit of wp once it hits it stiffens the enemy and turns them around to show you their back with a 100 chance of critical hit this is a cooldown b skill and has 5 seconds of cooldown because the motion for this skill can not be canceled if you use it after standstill basic attack it is activated quite slowly if you use it right after tenacious edge you might be able to activate it quickly but using it randomly will just get your wp dried up in an instant i recommend using this skill after you use petal bloom petal drill and tenacious edge twice 6 pokings in total using it randomly will just make you deal less damage to monsters it s best to limit its usage as it takes up a lot of wp has a pretty long delay and does not connect smoothly in a skill combo even if using it makes it look like it is speeding up the grinding with its damage l. oppression this skill doesn t seem to be that powerful when taking into account its 20-second-cooldown though the skill does come in handy when you are gathering mobs as it has pulling effect it has down attack and a quick cast time with no post-delay so i use this skill to kill monster with low hp it doesn t provide 100 stiffness and it can only be activated through quickslots with no command so it 's not really a good skill m. sticky snowflake this is an amazing skill which lets you move forward as you spin your weapon and attack enemies in front of you in a fan shape it is cooldown a skill and has a dot and a movement and attack speed debuffs as well however because it is a debuff skill its damage is low and the aoe is not so great when considering its long cooldown so sometimes you can t hit your enemy outside the fan area or is too close to you due to its aoe and down attack i think it s best to use this skill to finish off enemies that are knocked down since forward basic attack knocks down the target moving it fairly good range away from you with down attack effect forward basic attack sticky snowflake skill combo is considered good when you are using moonrise after using sticky snowflake the motion for the 1st hit of moonrise won t show and will be instantly followed by the 2nd and 3rd hit i think it was designed to be used as follows sticky snowflake moonrise frost pillars flow tip of the iceberg this skill goes up to 4 level and investing skill points in it doesn t really show great increase in efficiency so if you don t have enough skill points then i recommend investing in this later rather than early 3-2 flow skills these skills are what you can learn once you reach a higher level and are used in addition to existing awakening skills a flow tip of the iceberg this skill is cooldown a skill that is activated after frost pillars it has higher damage than an uncharged petal bloom and has down attack its only problem is that due to its long pre-delay slow motion short aoe so it must be used after moonrise flow tip of the iceberg doesn t have forward guard so unless your enemies are knocked down by frost pillars you d get hit by them it could even get canceled as it does not give super armor not to mention its long post-delay because its range is short if you want to hit enemies that are knocked down far away from you you d have to close in on them to hit them properly b flow moonlight dash you use this skill after using petal bloom after forward attack with petal bloom it makes the maehwa do a little jump and an additional attack with powerful damage it has down attack with down smash so you can do great damage in combination with petal bloom the only problem is that it takes some time before activation which you can use to alter the direction overall it will help you speed up grinding with its high damage c. flow cloud stab this is the skill that activates after using moonrise and can be used at any hit of moonrise this is a highly efficient maehwa skill with high damage and hp regen and it has quick activation time and forward guard also it has the most powerful air attack so you can do great damage if you use it after the 3rd hit of moonrise when enemies are launched into the air flow cloud stab is cooldown a skill and a main one too so i recommend using it constantly to keep your health full and to provide that additional attack damage d. flow december this is the skill you can use as additional damage after petal drill it has knock down which can be used as mediation for skills with down attack if you knock out enemies with the keripsear they will land in positions that make them susceptible to stickly snowflake or uncharged petal bloom if your enemy is too powerful to be knocked down it s better to use new year s eve instead of flow december 3-3 pre-awakening skill i recommend learning all passive skills first learn awakening skills if you didn t get enough skill points through some quests then you ll have to keep yourself from learning pre-awakening skills i ll only list pre-awakening skills that i think are crucial a chaos red moon this is the main skill for the maehwa that you use in pre-awakening stage it is cooldown a skill and has powerful damage similar to awakening skills it has a 30 critical hit chance and since it s easy for a maehwa to raise their critical hit it will be easy to have 100 critical hit chance it has forward guard and knocks the enemies into the air upon first hit with air attacks in the middle of the skill it s a powerful attack but it slows grinding due to being a channeled skill its last hit does not provide forward guard and has slow motion however it still is a powerful skill so you ll use it a lot in the pre-awakening stage and can use after awakening it gets more efficient once you have higher attack speed so after the new patch and awakening it became a good skill to use b blind thrust this skill is a cooldown c skill and it s a bad one if you only consider its attack damage but its lovely buffs make this skill a must +15 wp +20 melee attack +100 critical hit rate stiffness and decreased melee accuracy for those hit with an 18 increase in critical hit rate for 10 seconds each time you use it it resets its cooldown so refrain from using it too often if you want to utilize the effects mentioned above the cooldown is 4 seconds so check your cooldown before using the skill there s forward blind thrust and backward blind thrust depending on the command and you can only use the forward blind thrust when it s on cooldown forward blind thrust during forward movement has almost no pre/post-delay but using skills that come after like nemesis slash and backstab will be activated slowly if you use forward blind thrust a as for backward blind thrust there s a post-delay and the maehwa will thrust one more time if you click on your rmb it s not smooth or natural in skill combos due to this delay but it will have nemesis slash and backstab go out faster than forward blind thrust does c. ultimate nemesis slash this is the skill that generates hp and you use this after using blind thrust learning this skill will be great especially if you just finished your awakening as there won t be any awakening skills with life drain life drain from tenacious edge won t be enough when in the awakening stage switch to blade by w+c and press space bar quickly for its quick activation lift your finger from w when you press spacebar so that you can have backward blind thrust instead of front blind thrust d. maehwa s will another must-have for the maehwa it s better to make it a habit of using this skill whenever its cooldown is gone you can use this skill when you have either the blade or the kerispear out using this skill from the quickslot will switch your weapon to the blade while using it by command will keep the kerispear in your hand e. ultimate chase this is another essential skill for the maehwa this skill is a cooldown b skill gives you invincibility for one time and super armor until its cooldown is gone forward chase and backward chase are different backward chase makes you pass through the enemy you can evade enemy attacks and move to attack from behind when using this on your enemy practicing by moving your screen 180 degrees and keep your enemy behind you to use backward chase will help in many ways after using chase you ll be switching your weapon so instead of using dragon bite with the blade press c to switch to your kerispear which is better and use forward chase-c space space so that you can use nemesis slash right afterwards you may aim for an increase in speed when you cancel its motion with basic attacks while having your blade out but there s not much difference so it s better to just use chase it may seem faster with the kerispear but it shows slower movement speed thus more wp is used this skill will raise the maehwa s slow grinding speed slightly and will eat up a lot of your herbal juice f. sword training maneuver training sword training raises your attack points and unlike its name it also increases the kerispear s damage once you master it as for maneuver training this skill increases your evasion rate when you use blind thrust you will be able to see that you are not getting hit as much by enemies g. infinite mastery skilled hunter these two skills are essential skills that you must master having only high defense will get you killed and having only high hp will also get you killed it s best to have them both increased equally thus infinite mastery is a great skill that gives you high hp and makes you less likely to die also skilled hunter is a great skill that increases your damage against monsters considering how it is so costly to raise your attack points later in the game 3-4 bridge skill bridge skill refers to a skill that can connect a skill to another skill the following are the conditions for using a bridge skill a you must be able to cancel the previous skill b you must be able to cancel the following skill c. it must have short casting time and quick motion the bridge skills you can possibly use in the pre-awakening stage are the following divider forward blind thrust blunt kick here is a skill combo you can use with these skills basic attack divider forward blind thrust blunt kick chaos red moon context http //schema.org type socialmediaposting url https

the good thing about using a bridge skill is that a you can get skill buffs b you can deal more damage in less time c. you can move your position usually forward it may seem complicated at first but once you get used to it you can easily use the skill combo and instead of just using chaos red moon alone it s better to use this skill combo since it has the following benefits a basic attack gain wp b. divider heal hp wp hp recovery effect c. forwards blind thrust 100 critical hit rate d. blunt kick you can move further inside to deal full damage in a circular range and for some reason it makes the chaos red moon cast motion faster this is an example of how it would look if you use only bridge skills together although i personally don t recommend this skill combo context http //schema.org

in the image above but since tenacious edge is a cooldown b skill i don t recommend using tenacious edge alone to deal damage when going around the enemy at the same time if possible use sleet steps stigma must not be on cooldown sleet steps tenacious edge sleet steps moonrise in combo context http //schema.org type socialmediaposting url https //gfycat.com/ifr/vacantunsteadyamericanlobster

other skills rather than using one skill in a row since cooldown b skills deals less damage during their cooldown if you use the skill combo above due to stiffness effect from royal rage and tenacious edge you ll be able to use the moonrise combo in a back attack tenacious edge is a skill that thrusts the kerispear thrice two times so 6 in total its cooldown is set after the 2nd hit of three thrusts context http //schema.org type socialmediaposting url https //gfycat.com/ifr/soggycostlybarasinga headline 8 gif by strawberrybunny keywords null mainentityofpage true description watch and
