Conserved Domain Database (CDD) CD-Search & Batch CD-Search SPARCLE: Protein Classification CDART: Domain Architectures CDTree Identify the putative function of a protein sequence Identify a protein's classification based on domain architecture Identify the amino acids in a protein sequence that are putatively involved in functions such as binding or catalysis, as mapped from conserved domain annotations to the query sequence View a query protein sequence embedded within the multiple sequence alignment of a domain model Interactively view the 3D structure of a conserved domain Find other proteins with similar domain architecture Interactively view the phylogenetic sequence tree for a conserved domain model of interest with or without a query sequence embedded National Center for Biotechnology Information , U.S. National Library of Medicine 8600 Rockville Pike ,Â  Bethesda MD ,  20894 USA
