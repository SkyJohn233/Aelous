honest review review of sandy villas perissa greece tripadvisor we stayed here for a week firstly the greeting on arrival to the airport met by olympic rep who as soon as we mentioned trip advisor launched into a defensive very unprofessional outburst of her hate for trip advisor threw us off a bit and was a bit off putting on arrival a brief talk given by the owner then showed to your room most of the guests have seen trip advisor and it s a shame that it s all everyone can talk about in the pool around the pool must be honest despite the very very basic room we were allocated 18 am pleasantly surprised as the previous reviews left me worried my whole journey the room smelt of bleach was clean the bathroom is very basic with a shower hose that hooks into the wall there was some electrical wiring hanging out of the wall after discussing with the olympic rep three times it was finally repaired the day before we left as per previous reviews yes the drains do smell and the water is cold in the evenings but that s due to everyone showering at the same time the kitchenette area was extremely disappointing we ended up spending a lot more than we hoped eating out due to a lack of catering facilities firstly no kettle i strongly feel that the owners tour operators need to work on this issue what little cutlery and we stayed here for a week firstly the greeting on arrival to the airport met by olympic rep who as soon as we mentioned trip advisor launched into a defensive very unprofessional outburst of her hate for trip advisor threw us off a bit and was a bit off putting on arrival a brief talk given by the owner then showed to your room most of the guests have seen trip advisor and it 's a shame that it 's all everyone can talk about in the pool around the pool must be honest despite the very very basic room we were allocated 18 am pleasantly surprised as the previous reviews left me worried my whole journey the room smelt of bleach was clean the bathroom is very basic with a shower hose that hooks into the wall there was some electrical wiring hanging out of the wall after discussing with the olympic rep three times it was finally repaired the day before we left as per previous reviews yes the drains do smell and the water is cold in the evenings but that 's due to everyone showering at the same time the kitchenette area was extremely disappointing we ended up spending a lot more than we hoped eating out due to a lack of catering facilities firstly no kettle i strongly feel that the owners tour operators need to work on this issue what little cutlery and plates etc provided were of mismatched design and were actually dirty we had no hob when we arrived again had to ask for this and we had a piece of ply wood covering a huge burn underneath we had to battle with the owner for two wine glasses to enjoy some wine and simply resigned ourself to not self catering i would say the owner is nice until you have a complaint or issue and then beware the rep simply says i ca n't do much i have to work here for the next few weekday very unprofessional and random the owner of this hotel owns another establishment at the beach this resort is apparently room only and i think that the owner if not prepared to equip the room with adequate self catering items should change it from a self catering room the reps answer to the above as that the owner is safety conscious what a load of rubbish you either self cater or you do n't advertise it our fridge was playing up from arrival felt extremely warm on the outside checked the inside and it appeared to be on a normal setting for the uk between 3-4 down the road is a fantastic supermarket which would provide you with everything you need to self cater at hardly any cost local wine on tap a deli counter a 24 hour bakery so on all our food was frozen and we had to throw it all out discusses with the owner who was extremely rude actually asked a returning guest to deal with the issue we refused this and discussed with the olympic rep who again was n't very helpful initially said she was going to get the fridge changed and also discuss getting our money back approx 20 euros despite seeing the rep several times nothing ever transpired with this i would say that if you plan eating in your room every day this is not the place for you if you plan using it as a base its clean and very basic but you can live in it the rooms are very noisy you can hear any noise from upstairs or the adjoining rooms again people just enjoying their holidays but because not all rooms have air con then it seems people get so hot they attempt to re arrange their rooms for some air there have been previous reviews of a hard sell sandy sells you the safe key 15 euros for 1 week the air con in our case 6 euros per night and also yes you can get water down the road for half the price but we took the 6 bottles for 4 euros she offered to save us the first walk the pool area is brilliant immaculately clean the pool signs says they are open 8am 8pm this is apparently not the case and the owner actually practically pulls you out at 7.30 also they are n't too keen on kids playing jumping in you are watched the pool bar is very overpriced which is a shame as with some good marketing and some lowering of price it could be a real money maker the owners lack person skills i feel the main topic of conversation is about how hard they work and how hard their life is they own two hotels in santorini and work for half the year and i do n't really want to listen to you moan i 'm on holiday the wifi gets turned off in the night the owner tends to sit watching what everyone is doing and not work too hard anyway we went to one of the pools you can rent by the beach for a relaxed day one day which was amazing there are 3 bangladeshi men who work extremely hard all day cleaning the rooms and cleaning the pool area aside of this the pool area is lovely and clean really ca n't fault that part the towels and bedding need updating yes we all paid budget prices for our holidays but you do n't expect holes in your bedding and holes in your towels it makes for shabby living perissa is lovely and so accessible you can catch the bus around the whole island so i would definitely recommend if you want to see the island we booked a boat trip i would say dont book with olympic overpriced and lots of sad faces on the trips when they discovered what we paid down the road from the tour operators rather than via the agent for exactly the same trip 23 euros for a sunset boat tour climbing volcano visiting hot springs onto another island and then to oia for the amazing sunset absolute bargain and the most popular boat trip the buses all go to the capital thera and then branch from there your looking at 2.40 euros for the bus and they are so regular the island is tiny and so beautiful there 's lots of negative reviews about the cost of food and eating out i think you can pretty much eat to your budget a meal including wine and a side is possible for 12 euros we did this most days and also you can have seafood platter for 2 for 25 euros the seafront for cocktails is a little more expensive but we found our favourite bar that also does amazing food from next door cocktails are 4 euros and served with a smile and a snack every time the service goes a long way to make up for the attitude of the owners and the rep. dorian 's pub is the above place and we would all highly recommend would i come back yes definitely and i think with some changes sandy villas could be an amazing place but for this to happen both the owners and the rep need to care a little more about what 's happening and improve the service it just seems no one does care except when your outside of olympic or the villas i thought long and hard about whether to write an honest review and decided that yes i would if your looking for cheap and cheerful it is what you make of it then this could be the place for you our flight in and out were delayed making me miss my connection and the reps did a poor job of explaining things thank god for flight tracker to discovering exactly what was going on all in all i had an amazing holiday met some lovely people and would definitely recommend santorini and if some improvements are made to sandy villas which i seriously doubt it could be so amazing too more not what we expected the owner 'sandy just wants your money had to pay for air con.. Â£6 per day or pay for a fan basement room tiny and shower was always cold or did n't work one person described the pool as swimming in soup loved perissa and santorini is amazing but would never stay at sandy villas again she had the same worn dress on for the whole week we were their and was always scratching her crotch .. horrible to see we have just returned from this place and had a really good week relaxing family of four two adults and our two teenagers we had two studios opposite each other rooms 16 and 18 i shared 18 with our daughter and it was as previously stated very basic and you would certainly struggle to self cater as there was n't even a hob oven or microwave also hardly any crockery and what there was was rather gross to be honest i think it is really odd not even to have a kettle my husband and son shared room 16 which did have a two ring hob but not much else again same story as previous reviewers we were expecting to be bombarded with extras from the owner as soon as we arrived and we were it cost us about another 96 euros for the safe fan and air con of and expensive water but then that was it as we only had a couple of drinks by the pool and one dreadful meal after we arrived as we were tired we then just used the pool which is lovely and under the stunning scenery behind the apartments and bought our own snacks/drinks from nearby supermarket and had them on our balconies we ate out all the time down by the seafront lots of choice and a variety of prices too but all within walking distance and on the flat the 24 hr bakery next to the supermarket does amazing stuff and you can get takeaway teas and coffees too all lovely staff and so helpful we went away for a complete rest and that is what we did so although the sandy villas was basic it was clean and bedlinen and towels changed regularly i could go on and on about little things but it was n't that bad and after all the reviews we read we were expecting much worse i do n't think we would go back to sandy villas but would go to perissa beach again i think olympic holidays need to be more precise about exactly what you get or not with this place incidentally we have stayed all over the greek islands over many years and to be honest this is the standard of most basic villas etc so do n't be put off from visiting just do your own thing as we do and just use as a base at least it is clean with a great pool and in a great location to get to everything from the moment i stepped into this hotel i was horrified by the cleanliness of rooms attitude of staff and lack of basic essentials the hotel was basic as expected but having specified that i needed a room with wheelchair access when booking we were allocated a room with 7 steps down to the balcony two steps into the room and a further step in to the bedroom which was a serious struggle/hazard for my disabled grandmother on entering the room it was severely claustrophobic and filthy.the room had one small window allowing no light into the room what so ever the room was no where near suitable for three grown women to share for a week on entering the room there were dirty marks on the linen as if they had not been changed from the last people and the matress on the double bed was covered in stains the bathroom was diabolical with a door that did not shut let alone lock the shower taps were very grimey and the toilet seat was broken the mirror was rusted and the lighting was so poor that it was difficult to see the shower was situated virtualy on the toilet furthermore for 3 people to cater for themselves we had 1 plastic bowl 2 plastic plates and 2 glasses my cousin and i were not at all happy with the room and approached the rep lorraine who had at first been very kind although she helped to have us moved to another room she listened to our issue and told us she would leave it with sandy the hotel manager sandy kept beating around the bush and we had to wait from 1pm to 6pm to even see if the second room was suitable for us on being moved to the new room lorraine was very abrubt and it felt as if she was avoiding the situation by avoiding answering questions and giving the key to us to find the room ourselves even though the new room was much more open a suitable size for three women and accessible for my disabled grandmother again there were two cups a plastic bowl and a two ring electric cooker no where near enough equiptment to self cater the overall cleanliness of the room was still poor over the week i was shocked at the behaviour of the manager sandy every night kids were turfed out of the ppool at 7 30 having been told it was open 8- late and the bar was closed wifi switched off and lights off around the pool around 8 every night the was no holiday atmosphere about the hotel at all behind the bar looked just as filthy as the rooms the food and drinks were over priced as were the bottles of water sandy offered 6 large bottles for 4 euros and claimed we would n't get a better deal any where else a four minuite walk down the road lead you to 6 large bottles of water for less than 2 euros half of the food on the menu i ever asked for she did n't have my cousin was told that the aircon was 60 euros for the week however after paying the 60 we found a price list that said 6 euros a night there were two men doing all of the up keep and cleaning of the hotel who i admit were working extremely hard but more staff is really needed the only nice thing i can say about the hotel was that the pool was nice and it was in close proximity of the supermarket beach and resteraunts so luckily we could spend most of our time out of the hotel i made several new friends with other people and one particular family with a child invited me into their room i was shocked at the sight of a penis engraved across their whole mirror why it had not been removed or replaced i do not know but someone must have known it was their and it was just unacceptable to have not removed it back to the rep lorraine who was hardly ever around was not accepting to any further issues we had due to the rough start on our holiday on our return home we were spoken to rudely after having misunderstood that we were supposed to be on the coach rather than a minibus that was taking a few other parties on arriving at the airport 2 families who required special assistance including mine were told to wait in a different que the were a youbg couple with a 7 month old child who were also told to by lorraine to wait in this separate que the poor family were then sent to the back of a que of 100 people to wait to get into the airport in 30 degree heat even though they were first off the coach and told to wait aside lorraine shared no compassion for the family and seemed this way to many otgers throughout the week when she was around santorini was beautiful but i will never book a holiday with olympic or to sandy villas ever again arrived to be met by 'sandy and after brief introduction had to wait for half hour outside to be shown to room had a butlins feel about it room was spacious but stunk of drains badly equipped and throughout the week stunk of urine too plus 2 nights no hot water and most mornings again only cold smelly shower i understand basic but this was uninhabitable a lot of the time poor self catering facilities and â¬5 a day to hire kettle large pan took 20 mins bed mattress fell through through twice on investigation we found all slats loose.not screwed to frame and all make do offcuts- disgraceful nice clean balcony area so considered sleeping here noise travels and 3 hours sleep was the most important managed during the night you hear every voice every footstep every safe banging and every case wheel being dragged along have come home shattered all due to no sleep and no basic room comforts on arrival 'sandy came to room to hardshell ac â¬40 week fan hire â¬5 kettle hire â¬5 day and safe â¬15 and water â¬4 which was â¬2.90 2 min walk away is not happy when you say no and you feel that the entire stay her food at the pool bar is expensive and awful and her drinks .well â¬3 for a can and â¬5 for a cold tutti fruti drink are ridiculous you feel the evil stares is you dare to bring your own water and god help you of you bring a snack such as crisps biscuits or fruit to pool area she will tell you off my partner got told off for jumping not diving into an empty pool at 6pm he was playing ball with a teenage boy of some friends we met the woman is a bully at times its similar to laughingly being in a boarding school wifi is only available in the immediate pool bar area and if you annoy her she switches it off her greek nights on a thursday are cancelled as surprise surprise no guests want to come eat rubbish food be her 'friend one big happy family and pay â¬20 that all said the pool is lovely clean large and with plenty of sunbeds the location with the beautiful ancient thira mountain behind is stunning and daytimes here if you ignore 'sandy 's glances are peaceful however this is where the compliments end towels are starch like and full of holes toilet paper is rationed we hid ours in the safe and the olympic rep 'lorraine is the poorest excuse for a rep i 've ever seen she abused several customers and then tries to blame her rudeness on her geordie accent she 's just ignorant and nasty we stayed out of her way perissa is god location from which to explore book tours locally on main road as much cheaper than rip off olympic ones and visit the amazingly run italian 24 hr bakery and apollon a restaurant on the beach with fantastic staff food and drink views br sandy villas avoid them and the woman herself also be aware they 're known as sunday perissa village too she does n't even know what she 's doing with the name let alone how to run what could be an amazing property 2 bangladesh cleaners are amazing and live under the pool is a laundry area overworked and no doubt paid peanuts they do a fantastic job with their rubbish tools to be honest i 'm really shocked reading the reviews on all sites online about this place it shows a real lack of research into where people stay when they go on holiday do people really only read the travel agent blurb before i comment on sandy 's and santorini a bit about greek islands br if you 're booking an inexpensive holiday to greece and staying in a villa or apartment some things are pretty standard and have n't changed much in the 25 years since i started island hopping as a teenager your self catering accommodation will generally consist of pine single beds probably quite hard a sheet to cover you and a pillow your kitchen will have a fridge a two ring plug in hob a saucepan and a variety of plates cutlery and glasses your bathroom will be an accidental wet-room with a shower that floods the place you will probably be able to pay for air-con or rent a fan and rent a key for a small safe the wifi will be pretty poor and you may have to practically be sat on the router to get it to work your towels sheets get changed daily except sunday this is across the board in greece and if you are looking for kettles/ toasters/ hairdryers/ power showers/ microwaves/ corby trouser presses or a butler you may want to rethink your budget or go to benidorm as above this is what sandy villas is like it 's perfect for what we require as we only sleep amp shower in our villa on holiday we are always out and about my review is based on our needs we do n't go on holiday to sit in the room br our room at sandy 's was spotlessly clean spacious with a nice outside seating area we asked to pay for the air con and safe and for someone to get us some bottled water to get us going and this was all done with a smile and at no point was anything pushed to sell to us the pool area is beautiful and spotless with more than enough loungers to go around the bar sells a wide variety of of greek food as well as toasties baguettes etc and the food was perfect for when you just want a quick bite round the pool we found sandy wonderful she works from 6am to 2am 7 days a week in the summer season mostly alone as her sons husband all have seasonal jobs on the island too she was warm funny and she could n't have been more helpful and kind i 'm guessing if you moan at her constantly complain there 's no toaster demand to move rooms 3 times and make her cry you might get treated differently to us we all loved her the main road in perissa is a 5 minute walk away and the buses go from there regularly to and from fira amp oia day and night definitely worth exploring 5 minutes further you have the seafront with shops and tavernas and the volcanic black sandy beach kept lovely clean by the restaurateurs 10 minutes from the villa down the other fork in the road is the best 24 hour bakery in the world perfect for breakfasts br santorini itself is a beautiful island and worth exploring fira oia although more expensive to eat shop at boast one of the best sunsets in the world overlooking the dormant volcano boat trips are available from short ones to full days shop around but it 's worth noting that when you take one over to the volcano to climb it you really do need to wear sensible shoes and take a hat and a lot of water as you will be walking for an hour over rocks in relentless 32 heat with no shade or medics if you get in trouble the part of the trip to the hot springs is great but again be aware it 's a jump off the boat 5 minute swim in deep water to the spring the same back with 10 minutes treading water to get everyone back up the ladder onto the boat they do gloss over the fact you need to be a reasonable swimmer br we would n't hesitate to stay at sandy villas again we are a family of 4 with a 10 13 year old and it catered perfectly for all of us the poor reviews are clearly from people who did no research into where they were staying and greek islands in general do not be put off by ignorance it 's brilliant there
