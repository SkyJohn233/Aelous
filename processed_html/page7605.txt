PSA: Equip Thief Knife for Easier Skull Farming Attempt : MerchantRPG Boosted my skull farming attempt by a large margin. Result from farming skeleton soldier in a day: Was: 1~2 skulls a day Then: 3~6 skulls daily I wasn &# x27;t aware of the usage of luck stats until I found this subreddit and learned the explanation of the attributes. Right after that I rushed to Thief Knives farming and yield a +4 and +3 Thief Knives for each of my Warrior and Paladin whose tanking the stingy skeleton soldier. The result was greatly exceeding my expectation.     So far the only gears with a +luk modifying stats we possess are: Which yielding a total of possible  +10 Luck  per hero to boost item drops in a single quest. Will update this later as we got further updates.   Happy farming ! Also epic boss Oni and Hel drops skull 100% of time So 1-4 skull per 30minutes-1hr. I &# x27;m aware of that info, alas as I type this my last attempts to beat either of them were giving me 6 skulls of dead heroes instead. So yea, here I am crawling my way toward revenge. If only Luck would somehow make Arthus spawn... Thats the skull I need. If I could give you my Arthus, I would. He &# x27;s been glaring at me for days, and I &# x27;m too afraid to take him on yet. :/ You can definitely get more than 6 a day but yea knives and pendants help a lot 4.8k Members 19 Online Dec 22, 2014 Cake Day
