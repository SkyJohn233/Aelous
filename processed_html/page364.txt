Find the answer in the message I sent to customer service here bellow. Feel free to step into my footsteps, if you dare. ************* EBAY / PAYPAL you are junk! Took me 8 years to realize it! I am not allowed to pay for an item based on imaginary suspicious account activity. Thanks to your stupid machine algorithms - because you don't want to pay salaries to real people I guess - you lost me as customer, and the bye-bye message is "Error code: 70226" in translation "we are idiots - go buy it from amazon".  Done, got it from Amazon, now I know I will come back to ebay only as last f..king resort, only if I cannot find it anywhere else on Internet. Your **bleep** 8 years old ex-customer and biggest advocate in driving business away from you, fozulas PS English does not have the correct adjective to appellate how you are driving your business - but feel free to use your imagination instead. Oh, wait - I am talking with a machine... DUDE : CTRL+ATL+DEL dammit !!! **************** Since ebay customer service does not have email, I wonder where you actually sent this message? eBay will never read it here, because they are not here to see it. Even the moderators are from another company.
