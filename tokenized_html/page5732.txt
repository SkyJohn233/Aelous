additional article information the nucleoid-associated proteins h-ns and stpa in escherichia coli bind dna as oligomers and are implicated in gene regulatory systems there is evidence for both homomeric and heteromeric h-ns x02013 stpa complexes the two proteins show differential turnover and stpa was previously found to be subject to protease-mediated degradation by the lon protease we investigated which regions of the h-ns protein are able to prevent degradation of stpa a set of truncated h-ns derivatives was tested for their ability to mediate stpa stability and to form heteromers in vitro the data indicate that h-ns interacts with stpa at two regions and that the presence of at least one of the h-ns regions is necessary for stpa stability our results also suggest that a proteolytically stable form of stpa stpa f21c forms dimers whereas wild-type stpa in the absence of h-ns predominantly forms tetramers or oligomers which are more susceptible to proteolysis the h-ns protein of escherichia coli is a major component of the bacterial nucleoid and has been shown to affect several cellular processes such as gene expression recombination transposition and phage transposition reviewed in references 1 and 24 the h-ns protein binds dna in a relatively nonspecific manner but with some preference for curved sequences and high overexpression of h-ns causes a detrimental compaction of the chromosome 3 6 20 21 26 the h-ns protein negatively regulates expression from the cryptic bgl operon probably by binding to an at-rich nucleation site near the bgl promoter where a nucleoprotein complex is formed the site extends over the bgl promoter and thereby abolishes expression 16 an h-ns paralogue stpa has 58 x00025 identity to h-ns and is able to functionally substitute for h-ns in several cases although it also displays unique properties of its own 19 27 28 recent findings suggest that h-ns and stpa stimulate the expression of stringently regulated genes by their effect on local dna topology 10 the extensive identity between h-ns and stpa suggests that they are able to form heteromers and williams et al 25 were able to cross-link stpa with the 64 n-terminal amino acids of h-ns functionally the interaction between the stpa protein and the h-ns 64 peptide was important for silencing of the bgl operon and the stpa protein was suggested to function as a molecular adapter 7 recently we found that the stpa protein in the absence of h-ns was susceptible to lon protease proteolysis whereas stpa was stable in the presence of h-ns 12 this suggests that stpa is present mainly in heteromeric form with h-ns in the cell in this study we investigated what parts of h-ns are able to mediate stpa stability we present evidence that the protease-susceptible wild-type stpa protein stpa wt forms tetramers and oligomers in the absence of h-ns whereas the stable mutant protein stpa f21c predominantly forms dimers the strains used in this study were described before 11 12 bsn26 mc4100 trp :tn 10 bsn27 mc4100 trp :tn 10 x00394 hns bsn29 mc4100 trp :tn 10 x00394 hns stpa60 :km r jgj212 mc4100 zfi-3143 :tn 10 km r stpa wt jgj213

different strains were grown in luria-bertani lb medium 2 at 37 x000b0 c with vigorous shaking 220 rpm growth was monitored by measuring klett units on a klett-summerson colorimeter where 50 klett units corresponds approximately to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.4 where necessary the following antibiotics sigma were used carbenicillin 50 x003bc g/ml kanamycin 25 or 50 x003bc g/ml spectinomycin 100 x003bc g/ml and tetracycline 7.5 x003bc g/ml plates containing 40 x003bc g of the chromogen x003b2 -glucoside 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- x003b2 d -glucopyranoside sigma /ml were used to monitor the bgl phenotype expressed by the different hns deletion derivatives activity of the bgl operon was determined by the color of single colonies where blue colonies represent full derepression molecular genetic manipulations were performed essentially as described elsewhere 15 primer hns -up2 5 x02032 -cccgaattccctcaacaaacc-3 x02032 binding upstream of the hns gene and containing an eco ri restriction enzyme site was used together with either primer hns x00394 60 5 x02032 -ttatcaatattgctgcagcttacg-3 x02032 coding for the first 60 amino acids primer hns x00394 80c 5

full-length h-ns protein these three primer combinations were used on a wild-type hns sequence phmg409 9 creating pjob101 wild type pjob103 n60 and pjob104 n80 respectively furthermore primer hns -up2 together with either primer hns x00394 80 or primer 8 was used on a construct lacking an nru i fragment of the hns sequence creating an in-frame deletion of 21 codons the resulting constructs were named pjob105 n80 x00394 39 x02013 60 and pjob107 x00394 39 x02013 60 respectively the quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit stratagene was used to create the amino acid substitution mutant c21f pjob108 containing a phenylalanine instead of a cysteine at position 21 wild-type plasmid pjob101 was used as the template primers hns-o 5 x02032 -gcgcaggcaagagaattcacacttgaaacgctgg-3 x02032 and hns-u 5 x02032 -ccagcgtttcaagtgtgaattctcttgcctgcgc-3 x02032 were used to create the desired base pair substitution the pcr fragments were digested with eco ri cloned into the eco ri/ sma i site of pcl1921 13 and then sequenced subsequently the constructs were digested with eco ri/ bam hi and cloned into the eco ri/ bam hi site of the iptg isopropyl- x003b2 d -thiogalactopyranoside -inducible plasmid pmmb66eh 8 strains bsn26 bsn27 and bsn29 were transformed with the constructs in order to analyze the presence and stability of the truncated versions of h-ns strains containing the different constructs were grown to 50 klett units in the presence of 10 x02212 5 m iptg and protein synthesis was inhibited by the addition of 100 mg of spectinomycin/ml extracts were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds-page and silver staining and the constructs were found to be stable see fig x200b fig.1b 1 b these results are in keeping with the finding by ueguchi et al 22 who found that several truncated forms of h-ns are stable bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in sds-page sample buffer the different samples were subsequently subjected to sds-page 10 15 or 20 x00025 polyacrylamide for immunoblot detection the gel was blotted onto a 0.2-mm-pore-size polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane bio-rad by use of a semidry blotting apparatus polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against stpa was used as the primary antibody further visualization and quantification were done using chemifluorescent detection as described previously 11 or using the ecl-plus kit as described by the manufacturer amersham pharmacia all data are averages of at least two independent experiments to determine the intracellular stability of the stpa and h-ns proteins we followed a previously described method 12 protein stability was monitored after the protein synthesis had been inhibited by the addition of spectinomycin 100 x003bc g ml x02212 1 to bacterial cultures grown to 50 klett units in lb medium containing 10 x02212 5 m iptg at 37 x000b0 c. samples to be analyzed by western blotting were removed at various time points the peptides were cross-linked with dimethyl suberimidate dms sigma by a method described by ueguchi et al 23 cells for cross-linking were harvested from 5 ml of the culture washed with 10 mm tris-hcl ph 8.0 and subsequently freeze-thawed in the same buffer thereafter the cells were resuspended in cross-linking buffer 1 m triethanolamine-hcl x0005b ph 8.5 x0005d 0.25 m nacl and 5 mm dithiothreitol the cell extracts were sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000 x000d7 g for 30 min and the supernatants were incubated at room temperature without or with dms 1 mg ml x02212 1 after incubation for 30 or 60 min the samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and then resuspended in sds-page buffer in a previous study we showed that the stpa protein was unstable in the absence of h-ns whereas it remained stable in the presence of h-ns 12 in order to get further insight into the molecular interactions between h-ns and stpa we wanted to analyze what regions of the h-ns protein mediated this stability to do so genes encoding truncated versions of h-ns fig x200b fig.1a 1 a were constructed see materials and methods and cloned behind an iptg-inducible tac promoter since the stpa protein is unstable in the absence of h-ns the protein stability experiment was performed in the hns strain bsn27 containing plasmid constructs encoding the truncated versions of the hns gene the strains were grown to 50 klett units in lb medium containing 10 x02212 5 m iptg prior to the addition of spectinomycin and samples were removed at various time points the results fig x200b fig.2 2 clearly demonstrated that strains containing the pjob101 wild type pjob103 n60 pjob104 n80 and pjob107 x00394 39 x02013 60 plasmids retained similar levels of stpa 160 min after the addition of spectinomycin in the case of the n80 peptide there was some reduction but levels of at least 50 x00025 were retained after 160 min this suggests that these h-ns peptides were able to prevent proteolysis of stpa in contrast strains containing the vector plasmid or the construct pjob105 n80 x00394 39 x02013 60 did not contain detectable levels of stpa 160 min after the addition of spectinomycin indicating that these plasmids were unable to prevent stpa proteolysis previously we showed that a single amino acid change phenylalanine to cysteine at position 21 x0005b fig 1 c x0005d within stpa made the protein stable 12 interestingly a cysteine is present at that position in h-ns and to test if this particular residue was essential for the stability of h-ns and/or for the interaction between h-ns and stpa we constructed an inducible plasmid pjob108 that encoded an h-ns protein with an amino acid change from cysteine to phenylalanine at position 21 see materials and methods when tested in a stability experiment using strain bsn27/pjob108 the h-ns c21f mutant protein was as stable as the wild-type protein data not shown as seen in fig x200b fig.2 2 lanes 13 and 14 the h-ns c21f protein was still able to prevent proteolysis of stpa under the conditions tested a possible explanation for the stabilization of stpa by the n60 n80 and x00394 39 x02013 60 h-ns constructs would be that the stpa protein could directly interact with the h-ns polypeptides and thereby be protected from lon-mediated proteolysis in order to test this hypothesis we grew the hns strain bsn27 containing plasmid constructs encoding the truncated versions of the hns gene to 50 klett units in lb medium containing 10 x02212 5 m iptg prior to performing a cross-linking experiment protein extracts were analyzed by sds-page and western blot analysis as shown in fig x200b fig.3 3 half of the samples were exposed to dms whereas the other half were untreated materials and methods the results clearly suggested that strains containing pjob101 pjob103 pjob104 pjob107 or pjob108 produced h-ns polypeptides able to interact and cross-link with stpa as heterodimers the results of experiments illustrated in fig x200b fig.2 2 and x200b and3 3 suggest that h-ns interacts with stpa at two separate domains one situated in the middle portion and the other located in the c terminus of the h-ns protein also the prevention of stpa proteolysis requires at least one of these domains interestingly whereas both the wild type and the x00394 39 x02013 60 peptide seemed to x0201c trap x0201d the stpa protein in a dimer conformation fig x200b fig.3 3 lane 8 and 12 the n60 and the n80 peptides could mediate such trapping only partially instead several bands migrating more slowly appeared in these wells fig x200b fig.3 3 lane 2 and 4 we believe that these bands are oligomeric forms of stpa tetramers and oligomers the relative amounts of multimeric forms appeared to differ somewhat between different constructs shorter cross-linking treatments emphasized the difference and an example is shown by n80 in comparison with its vector control in fig x200b fig.3 3 lanes 16 to 18 the n80-stpa heterodimer was evidently the multimer present in most significant quantity in contrast the n80 x00394 39 x02013 60 peptide was not able to form heterodimers with stpa in this case the stpa protein formed predominantly oligomers with some dimer formation as well fig x200b fig.3 3 lane 6 previous results showed that the lon protease was involved in the turnover of stpa 12 it was therefore of interest to find out if stpa formed dimers or larger oligomers in a lon hns mutant strain samples of strains jgj221 hns lon x0002b and jgj223 hns lon were accordingly subjected to cross-linking tests as described above as shown in fig x200b fig.3 3 lanes 19 to 24 there was no indication of increased stpa dimer formation in the lon mutant derivative but the majority of stpa seemed to be present in relatively large oligomers free et al 7 reported results suggesting that the stpa protein was able to function as a molecular adapter for an h-ns protein lacking dna-binding function in the repression of the bgl operon intriguingly ohta et al 14 could not repeat that experiment but as discussed by those authors 14 this anomaly may be due to different strain backgrounds since free et al 7 used an mc4100 derivative whereas ohta et al 14 used a csh26 background we wanted to analyze our truncated h-ns derivatives for their ability to repress bgl expression and therefore used three different strains derived from mc4100 a wild-type bsn26 an hns bsn27 and an hns stpa bsn29 strain containing our constructs as seen in table x200b table1 1 the results indicate that the heterodimers formed between stpa and the h-ns derivatives in the hns strain bsn27 were also able to repress bgl expression the results also suggest that stpa is able to function as a molecular adapter for truncated h-ns since no repression of the bgl expression could be monitored in an hns stpa strain table x200b table1 1 in this context we also note that bgl expression was not repressed in the hns lon mutant strain jgj223 as judged by tests on indicator plates our previous finding that the stpa f21c protein was proteolytically stable even in the absence of h-ns 12 prompted us to compare the ability of stpa wt and stpa f21c to multimerize to investigate this we used both hns x0002b and hns mutant strains containing either stpa wt or the stpa f21c allele the strains were grown to 50 klett units in lb medium before they were subjected to cross-linking experiments with dms materials and methods in the presence of h-ns both stpa wt and stpa f21c predominantly formed heterodimers together with h-ns fig x200b fig.4a 4 a lanes 2 and 4 since no oligomers could be detected under such conditions however in the absence of h-ns the proteolytically unstable stpa wt protein predominantly formed oligomers fig x200b fig.4a 4 a lane 6 quantitative measurements showed that more than 60 x00025 of the stpa wt protein was present as oligomers and about 20 x00025 each was present as monomers and dimers fig x200b fig.4b 4 b interestingly only a small fraction x0003c 10 x00025 of the stable stpa f21c protein formed oligomers in the absence of h-ns instead most of the stpa f21c protein was detected as monomers and dimers after cross-linking fig x200b fig.4a 4 a lane 8 and 4b in this work we compared the multimerizing ability of the stpa wt and stpa f21c proteins our results suggest that in the absence of h-ns the stpa wt protein forms dimers to a much lesser extent than the stpa f21c protein which traps the stpa molecule in a dimeric form instead most of the stpa wt can be found as oligomers tetramers and oligomers fig x200b fig.4 4 the results of this study fig x200b fig.3 3 and x200b and4 4 together with earlier findings 12 suggest the following model fig x200b fig.5 5 the stpa wt protein is unable to form stable dimers and instead forms oligomers that are susceptible to degradation by the lon protease in contrast the stpa f21c protein predominantly forms stable dimers which are not degraded the stpa f21c protein has probably undergone a conformational change revealing a dimerization site that is normally x0201c masked x0201d in stpa wt but is available in h-ns our results also suggest that the stpa protein is largely protected from proteolysis in the presence of three truncated h-ns derivatives fig x200b fig.2 2 and that the protection is mediated by a direct interaction between the stpa protein and the h-ns peptide fig x200b fig.3 3 we also show evidence demonstrating that such an interaction functionally represses bgl expression in a strain lacking normal h-ns table x200b table1 1 the present data suggest that the h-ns protein is able to interact with the stpa protein at two distinct domains one situated between amino acids 39 and 60 and the other located between amino acid 80 and the c terminus fig x200b fig.1c 1 c previous reports have also identified c-terminally deleted h-ns as being able to interact with stpa 7 25 and to repress bgl expression in the presence of stpa 7 however we also show here that an h-ns molecule lacking the middle portion of the protein is still able to interact with and prevent degradation of stpa this stpa- x00394 39 x02013 60 complex can also repress bgl expression in the absence of h-ns previously the oligomerization domain of h-ns has been suggested to reside within the n-terminal or middle portion of the protein whereas the c-terminal part has been suggested to mediate dna binding 18 22 24 williams et al 25 discussed the possibility of an alteration of the nucleic acid binding after heteromerization between h-ns and stpa our results do not contradict this but they may indeed indicate a possible difference between h-ns x02013 h-ns homomerization and h-ns x02013 stpa heteromerization perhaps the c-terminal interaction between h-ns and stpa alters the dna-binding ability of the proteins and thereby causes a change in the dna motif recognized the physiological roles of different h-ns x02013 stpa complexes are not yet known the findings that there are both differential expression and turnover of the proteins suggest that levels of homomeric and heteromeric complexes can be regulated 12 19 furthermore it will be of interest to find out if other proteins with similarities to h-ns in the c-terminal domain 5 might also be involved in complex formation with h-ns and/or stpa we are grateful to monica persson for
