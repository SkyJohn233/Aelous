autoantibodies to intracellular rods and rings structures anti-rods/rings or anti-rr are strongly associated with hepatitis c hcv patients treated with interferon-α/ribavirin ifn/rbv and are linked with non-responsiveness to ifn/rbv or relapse especially in italian patients this is the first study to determine whether there is any correlation of anti-rr with non-responsiveness to ifn/rbv treatment in patients also treated with telaprevir tpv one of several new therapies for chronic hcv recently implemented from 2013 to 2014 52 hcv-infected patients were treated with ifn/rbv and tpv at five italian clinics patient sera were collected and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence for the presence of anti-rr antibodies patients were classified as anti-rr positive or anti-rr negative and then various biological and clinical variables were analyzed to compare the two groups including gender age hcv genotype previous ifn/rbv treatment and ifn/rbv/tpv treatment outcome of these 52 hcv patients treated with ifn/rbv/tpv 10/32 31 who previously received ifn/rbv were anti-rr positive compared to 0 of 20 treatment-naïve patients anti-rr-positive patients relapsed more than anti-rr-negative patients 3/10 30 vs. 2/42 5 p 0.05 however zero anti-rr-positive patients were non-responsive and frequencies of sustained virological response were similar anti-rr positive 7/10 70 vs. anti-rr negative 33/42 79 overall the data suggest that anti-rr seropositivity is not associated with resistance to tpv treatment in this patient cohort but monitoring anti-rr-positive patients for relapse within the first 6 months after treatment may be useful chronic hepatitis c hcv infection is associated with the production of autoantibodies including organ-specific autoantibodies directed against targets in the thyroid adrenal cortex pancreatic islet cells and gastric parietal cells and non-organ-specific autoantibodies such as antinuclear anti-smooth muscle anti-mitochondrial anti-liver/kidney microsomal and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies 1 – 8 recent studies have also demonstrated a link between hcv and the production of autoantibodies targeting intracellular filamentous structures termed rods and rings rrs 9 – 16 in most studies anti-rods/rings anti-rr seropositivity appears to be almost exclusive to hcv patients treated with interferon-α and ribavirin combination therapy ifn/rbv and is rarely seen in treatment-naïve hcv patients or other disease groups however anti-rr has been observed in one hepatitis b patient 11 one systemic lupus erythematosus patient 17 and healthy individuals with no previous ifn/rbv treatment 17 in cultured cells rrs are composed of inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase impdh and/or cytidine 5′-triphosphate synthase under certain conditions 9 18 19 rrs tend to assemble when de novo purine biosynthesis is inhibited and guanine nucleotide levels become depleted 20 – 25 many patients with anti-rr react with impdh which is inhibited by direct binding to rbv and appears to be the major autoantigen in rrs 9 26 27 although no mechanistic evidence suggesting that anti-rr autoantibody contributes to resistance to ifn/rbv therapy has yet been reported previous studies showed that anti-rr antibodies were more prevalent in patients who did not respond to therapy or relapsed when compared to sustained responders 10 15 additionally non-responsive or relapsing patients had higher anti-rr titers suggesting that anti-rr positivity may be indicative of poor treatment outcomes 28 in recent years direct-acting antivirals daas such as telaprevir tpv have been developed for chronic hcv infection in an effort to reduce therapy duration and increase drug tolerability while also improving patient outcomes currently tpv is included with ifn/rbv as a triple therapy here we examine the relationship between anti-rr and treatment outcomes in a cohort of italian patients treated with ifn/rbv and telaprevir from 2013 to 2014 52 hcv-infected patients were treated with ifn/rbv and tpv at five italian clinics located at the 1 ospedale san antonio tolmezzo 2 ospedale santa chiara trento 3 università degli studi di siena 4 ospedale regionale treviso and 5 università degli studi di genova dosages depended on patient weight 75 kg discriminating weight and were typically administered as follows 80–180 µg weekly pegylated interferon-α 600–1400 mg daily ribavirin and 2250 mg daily tpv patients were classified as not responsive to therapy hcv rna still detectable at week 24 of therapy relapsed hcv rna detectable after the end of treatment in patients with previous virological response or responsive to therapy hcv rna not detectable in the 24 weeks after the completion of therapy the study conforms to the institutional review board requirements in all institutions informed consent informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study all patients provided written informed consent to receive ifn/rbv/tpv and permission for use of their medical records for this study anti-rods/rings in patient sera were detected by indirect immunofluorescence using nova lite hep-2 ana substrate inova diagnostics san diego ca 508100 as previously described 10 staining patterns of test sera were compared to staining of human prototype anti-rr serum it2006 used in previous studies 9 10 it2006 and all anti-rr-positive sera described in this study correctly recognize the rods and rings ana pattern designated as pattern ac-23 by the international consensus on ana patterns icap 29 all sera were tested at a dilution of 1:80 in pbs as previously described 30 for anti-rr-positive patients who also had serial samples available anti-rr end point titers were determined using twofold serial dilution of sera in pbs with a starting dilution of 1:80 and ending dilution of 1:1280 anti-rr positivity and titers were independently validated by two trained individuals s.j.c and t.n. end point titer was defined by more than 50 of cells containing detectable rr staining donkey anti-human igg conjugated to dylight 488 jackson immunoresearch west grove pa diluted 1:100 in pbs was used to detect autoantibody staining fluorescent images were captured with a zeiss axiovert 200 m microscope fitted with a zeiss axiocam mrm camera using a 40× 0.75 na objective carl zeiss microscopy jena germany biological and clinical variables analyzed for statistical significance include gender age hcv genotype previous treatment with ifn/rbv prior to beginning of tpv regimen and treatment outcome see table 1 mann–whitney u test was used to compare different groups containing continuous data and fisher s exact test or the fisher–freeman–halton exact test was used for categorical data differences were considered statistically significant if p 0.05 mann–whitney u test and fisher s exact test were performed using graphpad prism 5.0 graphpad software la jolla ca fisher–freeman–halton test was performed using statxact 10 cytel cambridge ma the goal of this study was to probe for an association between the presence of anti-rr autoantibody and treatment outcome in a cohort of 52 italian hcv patients treated with the new daa telaprevir this is the first study to examine anti-rr in patients treated with any of the recently approved daas it must be pointed out that in general the availability of patients for studies of anti-rr antibody is naturally limited by the low prevalence of this autoantibody response although it has been reported that 20–40 of hcv patients treated with ifn/rbv produce anti-rr autoantibodies this response is very rarely observed in treatment-naïve hcv patients or other disease groups 10 11 14 – 16 31 a total of 52 hcv-infected patients were treated with ifn/rbv and tpv thirty-six patients 69 were male and 16 31 were female with a mean age of 54 ± 9 years twelve patients 23 had genotype 1a 39 patients 75 had genotype 1b and one patient 2 had genotype 3b thirty-two patients 62 had been previously treated with ifn/rbv prior to being put on tpv patient demographics are included in table 1 all 52 patients were assayed for the presence of anti-rr according to standard antinuclear antibody indirect immunofluorescence ana-iif protocols using hep-2 cells as a substrate ana-iif analysis revealed that 10 out of 52 patients 19 were positive for anti-rr at a dilution of 1:80 figure 1 displays the images of the rods and rings staining pattern from all ten anti-rr-positive patients patient codes c1tn fv1s tbn1s va1s tg1to sl1g vg1g ms1g rc1g and cb1g anti-rr-negative patients cd2t and e1tn are also shown for comparison twenty-one out of 52 patients had serial collections of sera available 104 total sera for 52 patients representing multiple visits to the clinic over time periods ranging from 2 weeks to 13 months anti-rr status did not change over time in any of these 21 patients i.e. anti-rr-positive patients remained positive and negative patients remained negative and anti-rr titers did not significantly change in positive patients accordingly for purposes of statistical analysis patients were simply considered either positive or negative and serial collections were not taken into consideration anti-rods/rings seropositivity detected by the ana-iif assay fifty-two italian hcv patients were subjected to the antinuclear antibody indirect immunofluorescence ana-iif assay anti-rods/rings autoantibody was detected in 10 of 52 patients 19 shown by the rods and rings ana pattern in patient

by donkey anti-human igg conjugated to dylight 488 all images were taken with a 40× objective patients were divided into two main groups anti-rr-positive n 10 and anti-rr-negative n 42 for subsequent statistical analysis these groups were compared based on several demographic clinical and serological parameters to determine any differences between anti-rr-positive and anti-rr-negative patients table 1 there was no significant difference observed between the two groups when comparing gender age or hcv genotype both patient groups were also categorized into four different treatment outcome groups 1 sustained virological response svr with no side effects 2 initial svr but therapy was discontinued due to side effects 3 relapse within 6 months of treatment and 4 no response to treatment svr patients with or without side effects were all determined to be svr at the same time point after 1 month according to international guidelines when the fisher–freeman–halton exact test was performed to compare anti-rr-positive vs. anti-rr-negative patient groups based on all four treatment outcome parameters no significant difference was observed however additional fisher–freeman–halton analysis with all svr patients combined regardless of side effects resulted in a statistically significant p value 0.05 table 1 bottom row thus our data indicate that anti-rr-positive and anti-rr-negative patients in this cohort appear to differ with regard to distribution of treatment outcomes the most notable difference is that anti-rr-positive patients were more likely to relapse than anti-rr-negative patients p 0.05 despite the increase in relapse 0 of the 10 anti-rr-positive patients were non-responsive to therapy compared to 7 of the 42 17 anti-rr-negative patients p 0.32 additionally there was no significant difference in svr rates between both groups svr rates were compared with patients who experienced side effects and those who did not separated as different outcomes svr but side effects and svr no side effects or with all svr patients combined svr combined but both analyses showed no significant difference between anti-rr-positive and anti-rr-negative patients we also discovered that anti-rr can be detected years after treatment with ifn/rbv two of the ten anti-rr-positive patients had serum collected both prior to and after ifn/rbv/tpv therapy was initiated all samples from both patients were positive for anti-rr initially suggesting that these patients may have been positive with no previous ifn/rbv treatment however after careful examination of medical records it was determined that both patients had received ifn/rbv more than a decade prior to treatment with tpv patient tbn1s was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 2000 and treated with ifn/rbv from 2000 to 2002 but treatment was eventually discontinued due to side effects in 2014 tbn1s began receiving ifn/rbv again with addition of tpv but relapsed within 6 months patient va1s previously received ifn/rbv for 6 months in 2003 eleven years later in 2014 the patient began receiving ifn/rbv again with addition of tpv but therapy was discontinued due to side effects despite the lack of exposure to ifn/rbv for more than 10 years both patients remained positive for anti-rr autoantibody and va1s even remained positive down to 1:1280 dilution we speculate that long-lived plasma cells might be responsible for the long-term presence of anti-rr antibody in these patients previous studies have suggested that anti-rr titer increases throughout the duration of therapy but declines upon cessation of treatment 11 12 15 31 to our knowledge this is the first report of long-lived anti-rr autoantibody previous studies established a strong association between anti-rr and ifn/rbv therapy 10 – 12 14 15 such that we previously described anti-rr as a drug-induced autoantibody 13 additionally prolonged exposure to ifn/rbv increases the likelihood of anti-rr autoantibody production 11 12 15 our data support these findings considering that 10 out of 32 31 patients previously treated with ifn/rbv were anti-rr positive compared to 0 out of 20 patients who had not previously received ifn/rbv in terms of treatment outcome previous reports have indicated a link between anti-rr and non-responsiveness or relapse in american and italian hcv patient cohorts 10 15 28 in the current study with a new cohort of italian patients we again found that anti-rr seropositivity was associated with increased frequency of relapse interestingly the frequency of non-responsiveness appeared to be decreased in anti-rr-positive patients 0/10 0 compared to anti-rr-negative patients 7/42 17 despite the opposite trend in relapse when patients with no previous ifn/rbv treatment are removed from analysis the trend remains similar with non-responsiveness occurring in 0/10 0 of anti-rr-positive patients compared to 6/16 27 of anti-rr-negative patients p 0.14 overall 19 10/52 of hcv patients in this study were positive for anti-rr which is similar to the rates observed in previous studies 10 11 14 – 16 importantly the addition of tpv to the ifn/rbv regimen did not induce a new anti-rr response in any patients anti-rr-negative patients previously treated with ifn/rbv did not become positive after tpv was included in the regimen likewise anti-rr titers did not significantly change after addition of tpv in anti-rr-positive patients with serial samples available in all our data suggest that inclusion of tpv in the ifn/rbv regimen for the treatment of chronic hcv does not alter the production of anti-rr autoantibody however based on the statistically significant increase in relapse rate it may be useful to carefully monitor anti-rr-positive patients during and for 6 months after ifn/rbv/tpv therapy while our study is limited by the number of available patients the data indicate that anti-rr seropositivity does not affect the response to tpv treatment for chronic
