France ' s Suez to Sell Water-Treatment Unit - WSJ Enter News, Quotes, Companies or Videos https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB106261406697474700 French water and energy conglomerate          Suez  SA        unveiled an agreement Thursday to sell its water-treatment-supplies unit to a consortium of U.S. private-equity firms for $4.2 billion ( & euro;3.88 billion). Suez's board met Wednesday afternoon and approved the sale of the Ondeo Nalco unit to a consortium that includes Blackstone Group, Apollo Management LP and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, a unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The group had emerged as the front-runner to buy the Suez unit earlier this week after a hotly contested auction run by Suez's adviser, UBS AG. Suez also reported first-half results Thursday, posting a  & euro;1.64 billion loss for the first half of 2003 ended June 30, compared with a  & euro;164 million net profit in the year-earlier period. The company said earnings sagged under the weight of  & euro;2 billion in exceptional items, including a  & euro;700 million loss on the disposal of Nalco and a  & euro;700 million write-down of its communications assets. The sale of the business to a consortium of private-equity investors is the latest sign of the increasing role that financial sponsors have been playing in this year's merger scene. On both sides of the Atlantic, as strategic buyers have been sidelined to tend to corporate scandals or ailing businesses, private-equity buyers, flush with cash, have been making big, splashy purchases. In February, Blackstone, acting solo, bought TRW Automotive from its parent TRW Inc. for $4.7 billion. Then, a few months later, a consortium of private equity firms won a hotly contested auction to buy the telephone-directories unit of Italy's Seat Pagine Gialle SpA in two transactions, valued at about $6 billion. The total represented Europe's biggest-ever private-equity deal. And, earlier this summer, U.S. private-equity firm Carlyle Group teamed up with Italy's Finmeccanica to buy FiatAvio SpA, Fiat Group's aerospace business for about  & euro;1.5 billion. As part of the deal, the group of private-equity firms will assume a $150 million capital lease on a building that Ondeo Nalco uses in Naperville, Illinois. The company sold the building last year and is leasing it now. A sale of the Ondeo Nalco unit would mark an important milestone in Suez's effort to slash its onerous debt load. Since the start of the year, the French company has been scrambling to sell assets, disposing of stakes in French insurance titan AXA SA, oil behemoth Total SA, construction company Vinci SA, financial group Fortis NV and a 75% interest in Northumbrian Water Group PLC, Suez's U.K water company. The sales have helped Suez raise  & euro;6 billion which the company plans to use to help it shed its  & euro;26 billion debt burden. Based in Naperville, Ondeo Nalco makes chemical products and filters used by municipalities and industrial companies for the treatment of water. Suez bought Ondeo Nalco for $4.5 billion in 1999 as part of a bid to expand into the U.S. The company later combined the unit with its other water-treatment operations and renamed the business Ondeo Nalco. The sale of Suez's water assets is the latest in a long series of disposals by European companies that have been selling off operations that they acquired in the euphoria of the 1990s. Now, with stretched balance sheets, they are unloading these operations frequently at a discount to what they paid. That is good news for private-equity funds that are buying operations at what appears to be a better time in the business cycle and are frequently paying a lower multiple for them as potential strategic buyers remain on the sidelines. Moreover, the capital markets are still willing to finance their deals at relatively attractive terms. Despite the recent run-up in interest rates, short-term rates are still hugely attractive, making it inexpensive and easy to fund such deals with debt. The three co-investors plan to finance as much as 80% of the deal with a mix of high-yield bonds and bank loans.  " The company has steady revenues and strong cash flows, "  says one party to the deal.  " It can sustain a lot of debt.
