putting-out system wikipedia the putting-out system is a means of subcontracting work historically it was also known as the workshop system and the domestic system in putting-out work is contracted by a central agent to subcontractors who complete the work in off-site facilities either in their own homes or in workshops with multiple craftsmen it was used in the english and american textile industries in shoemaking lock -making trades and making parts for small firearms from the industrial revolution until the mid-19th century however after the invention of the sewing machine in 1846 the system lingered on for the making of ready-made men 's clothing 1 the domestic system was suited to pre-urban times because workers did not have to travel from home to work which was quite impracticable due to the state of roads and footpaths and members of the household spent many hours in farm or household tasks early factory owners sometimes had to build dormitories to house workers especially girls and women putting-out workers had some flexibility to balance farm and household chores with the putting-out work this being especially important in winter the development of this trend is often considered to be a form of proto-industrialization and remained prominent until the industrial revolution of the 19th century at that point it underwent name and geographical changes however bar some technological advancements the putting-out system has not changed in essential practice contemporary examples can be found in china india and south america and are not limited to the

and london areas although significant variation occurred almost all of the contractors manufactured parts or fitted them through a highly decentralized putting-out process using small workshops and highly skilled labor in small arms making as in lock production the workshop system rather than the factory system was the rule 2 all of the processes were carried out under different cottage roofs it was replaced by inside contracting and the factory system the domestic system was a popular system of cloth production in europe it was also used in various other industries including the manufacture of wrought iron ironware such as pins pots and pans for ironmongers it existed as early as the 15th century but was most prominent in the 17th and 18th centuries it served as a way for capitalists and workers to bypass the guild system which was thought to be cumbersome and inflexible and to access a rural labour force having the workers work in their homes was convenient for both parties workers would work from home manufacturing individual articles from raw materials then bring them to a central place of business such as a marketplace or a larger town to be assembled and sold in other cases travelling agents or traders would tour the villages supplying the raw materials and collecting the finished goods the raw materials were often provided by the merchant who received the finished product hence the synonymous term putting-out system the advantages of this system were that workers involved could work at their own speed while at home and children working in the system were better treated than they would have been in the factory system although the homes might be polluted by the toxins from the raw materials as the woman of a family usually worked at home someone was often there to look after any children the domestic system is often cited as one of the causes of the rise of the nuclear family in europe as the large amount of profits gained by common people made them less dependent on their extended family these considerable sums of money also led to a much wealthier peasantry with more furniture higher-quality food and better clothing than they had had before it was mostly centralized in western europe and did not take a strong hold in eastern europe thomas hood 's poem the song of the shirt 1843 describes the wretched life of a woman in lambeth labouring under such a system it was written in honour of a mrs. biddell a lambeth widow and seamstress living in wretched conditions in what was at that time common practice mrs. biddell sewed trousers and shirts in her home using materials given to her by her employer for which she was forced to give a £2 deposit in a desperate attempt to feed her starving infants mrs. biddell pawned the clothing she had made thus accruing a debt that she could not pay mrs. biddell whose first name has not been recorded was sent to a workhouse and her ultimate fate is unknown however her story became a catalyst for those who actively opposed the wretched conditions of england s working poor who often spent seven days a week labouring under inhuman conditions barely managing to survive and with no prospect for relief citation needed anders jonsson 1816–1890 was a famous swedish entrepreneur who continued a putting-out business at holsljunga he contracted up to 200 domestic workers who came to his house to get the raw material and returned after a couple of weeks with textiles that local pedlars from the city of borås then bought and went out to sell among other things around sweden and norway a cottage industry is an industry —primarily manufacturing —which includes many producers working from their homes typically part-time the term originally referred to home workers who were engaged in a task such as sewing lace-making wall hangings electronics or household manufacturing some industries which are usually operated from large centralized factories were cottage industries before the industrial revolution business operators would travel around the world buying raw materials delivering them to people who would work on them and then collecting the finished goods to sell or typically to ship to another market one of the factors which allowed the industrial revolution to take place in western europe was the presence of these business people who had the ability to expand the scale of their operations cottage industries were very common in the time when a large proportion of the population was engaged in agriculture because the farmers and their families often had both the time and the desire to earn additional income during the part of the year winter when there was little work to do farming or selling produce by the farm 's roadside
