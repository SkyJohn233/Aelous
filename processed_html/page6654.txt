Albert Giraud’s Pierrot Lunaire Richter This title is OUT OF PRINT. This is the first English translation of Belgian poet Albert Giraud’s collection of fifty poems,  Pierrot Lunaire: Rondels Bergamasques  (1884). Paperback Look Inside This is the first English translation of Belgian poet Albert Giraud’s collection of fifty poems,  Pierrot Lunaire: Rondels Bergamasques  (1884). Giraud’s work was translated to German by Otto Erich Hartleben and twenty-one of those poems were used by Arnold Schoenberg in his masterpiece  Pierrot Lunaire  (1912)—one of the defining compositions of the twentieth century. These English renderings reveal the extent to which Hartleben introduced changes as he translated the work. Taken as a whole, this trilingual edition suggests how the French fin de siècle served as a model for the early twentieth-century German avant-garde, which culminated in Schoenberg’s masterpiece. At long last, both Albert Giraud’s complete cycle of Pierrot poems and an English translation, plus the complete German translation/paraphrases of Otto Erich Hartleben, are available for literary and musical readers alike. For those who prize Arnold Schoenberg’s  Pierrot Lunnaire , op. 21 — one of the most important compositions of the twentieth century—and those intrigued by fin-de-siècle European poetry, this volume is a godsend. —Susan Youen Translator’s Note 1.
