tool for novel small rna discovery illumina small rna sequencing library preparation requires a pre-adenylated 3 end adapter containing a 5 ,5 -adenyl pyrophosphoryl moiety in the absence of atp this adapter can be ligated to the 3 hydroxyl group of small rna while rna self-ligation and concatenation are repressed pre-adenylated adapters are one of the most essential and costly components required for library preparation and few are commercially available we demonstrate that dna oligo with 5 phosphate and 3 amine groups can be enzymatically adenylated by t4 rna ligase 1 to generate customized pre-adenylated adapters we have constructed and sequenced a small rna library for tomato solanum lycopersicum using the t4 rna ligase 1 adenylated adapter we provide an efficient and low-cost method for small rna sequencing library preparation which takes two days to complete and costs around 20 per library this protocol has been tested in several plant species for small rna sequencing including sweet potato pepper watermelon and cowpea and could be readily applied to any rna samples the rapidly increasing nextgen sequencing capacity is enabling researchers to combine more samples for multiplexed sequencing and the sequencing cost itself could be less than that of the library preparation 1 we have previously reported a high-throughput rna sequencing strategy that has significantly lowered the library preparation cost 2 here we sought to develop an alternative protocol that would also simplify the small rna library preparation we note that both the illumina small rna sequencing and directional mrna sequencing library construction protocols are based on the early microrna cloning strategies 3 in which two adapters are sequentially attached to the rna molecule to create the priming sites for subsequent pcr amplification the 5 adapter is a conventional rna oligo that can be synthesized by commercial oligo manufacturers the 3 adapter is a modified dna oligo containing a 5 5 -adenyl pyrophosphoryl moiety and a 3 blocking group such as amine or dideoxylnucleotides the adenyl modification on 3 adapter is crucial for the library preparation as it enables the adapter to be ligated to rna in the absence of atp by a truncated form of t4 rna ligase 2 this effectively prevents small rna self-ligation and concatenation despite the simplicity of this method the adenylated dna oligos are very costly to synthesize and few are available commercially it has been reported that t4 dna ligase can convert dna oligos to pre-adenylated adapters 4 in a ligation reaction t4 dna ligase first adenylates the donor dna that has a 5 phosphate and the adenylated intermediate reacts with the acceptor dna with a free 3 hydroxyl group resulting in phosphodiester bond formation this process could be interrupted allowing the adenylated intermediate to be purified however the adenylation efficiency of t4 dna ligase is inconsistent and several improvements have been suggested to optimize the reaction 5 we reason that the difficulties of utilizing t4 dna ligase to generate adenylated adapters are partly due to the fact that it works best on double-stranded substrate while the desired adapter is a single-stranded molecule hence an rna ligase could be a more suitable enzyme for adapter adenylation since rna ligation also generates a 5 adenylated donor intermediate 6 in this report we demonstrate that t4 rna ligase 1 can efficiently adenylate dna oligos with 5 phosphate and 3 blocking group and we have optimized the reaction condition for large-scale adapter production using the enzymatically adenylated adapters we developed a rapid and cost-effective protocol to generate small rna sequencing libraries agarose gel electrophoresis system polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis

qiagen nucleotide removal kit adjust the adapter concentration to 10 um with rnase-free water note in this reaction t4 rna ligase 1 will first adenylate the 5 phosphorylated dna oligo and attempt to join it with a suitable acceptor molecule with a 3 hydroxyl group the 3 end of the oligo is block with amine and could not take part in the ligation reaction leading to accumulation of the adenylated

and 120 bp respectively figure 1 b whereas the reverse transcription and pcr primers used in the illumina non-multiplex library preparation lack the barcode sequences hence the sizes of non-multiplex srna-seq library and adapter dimer are smaller at 120 and 90 bp respectively cut the band corresponding to the small rna library and gel-purify the product with qiagen minelute kit optional step adjust pcr cycles accordingly to avoid over or insufficient pcr amplification quantify the purified library using quanit hs dna assay kit use 10 ul of library with a final concentration no less than 2 ng/ul for each lane of illumina sequencing optional if multiplex srna-seq libraries were used mix equal amount 10 ng of each libraries concentrate using qiagen minelute kit and use 10 ul library with a final concentration no less than 2 ng/ul for each lane of illumina sequencing it has been shown that t4 rna ligase 1 could be used to adenylated rna oligos 7 8 to examine its adenylation efficiency on dna substrates we have synthesized a 5 phosphorylated and 3 amine blocked single-stranded dna substrate p-ctgtaggcaccatcaat-amine according to the first published microrna cloning adapter 3 since its 3 end is blocked by the amine modification when its 5 end is activated by adenylation there is no free 3 hydroxyl group available for ligation leading to accumulation of the adenylated intermediate we incubated the substrate with t4 rna ligase 1 under various reaction conditions and in all cases a clear band shift was observed on the denatured page indicating successful adenylation figure 2 we found that adenylation reactions at room temperature with 10 μm of substrate and in the presence of 20 peg gave the best result it has been shown that t4 rna ligase 1 adenylates ribonucleotides with different efficiencies and rctp is its best substrate 6 – 8 we examined its ability to act on dna substrates with different 5 deoxylnucleotides and found that oligos starting with a 5 dc were efficiently adenylated figure 2 b hence we have designed all 3 adapters with a 5 dc to maximize the adenylation efficiency unlike the t4 dna ligase-based method that requires time-consuming page separation of the adenylated product from other oligos used in the reaction oligos adenylated by t4 rna ligase 1 can be directly purified using a sephadex buffer exchange column or commercial kits we have generated a srna-seq library for tomato fruit using the t4 rna ligase 1 adenylated adapter and the result matches the published tomato small rna datasets 9 generated by illumina reagents figure 3 this protocol has also been adopted for small rna sequencing in different plant species including sweet potato pepper watermelon and cowpea adenylation of 3 adapter using t4
