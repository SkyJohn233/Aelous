Toro Combination Vacuum Relief and Air Release Valves | Toro Australia : Create a Greater Outdoors The air release feature allows air to escape the pipeline during system start-up, while the vacuum relief feature allows air to enter the pipeline during valve closure or system shutdown. The vacuum relief minimises: • Collapse of mainline and submain pipes due to the vacuum. • Back siphonage of dirt into emitters. (Vacuum relief can reduce this problem and in some cases eliminate it.) • Water hammer caused by sudden reversal of flows, especially downstream of a valve.
