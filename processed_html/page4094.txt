Each kit is proven on a rear-wheel dynamometer to increase horsepower and     How does a K & N High Flow Intake System increase horsepower?             By eliminating airflow obstruction in your engine. Restriction of air flow between an air filter and an engine robs even the most powerful engine of horsepower. K & N air intake kits virtually eliminate air path restriction by replacing the standard air filter and the entire air path to the engine. Put all this together and you have the best high-flow intake system available today.         >                                                                            < p>                     >                                                                            < p>                     >                                                                            < p>                             Designed to Increase Horsepower                 K & N is the leader in high quality performance cold air intake systems for car and trucks. We feel it is one of the best dollars to horsepower investments you can make for your vehicle. Our first air intake kit was built in 1992. K & N manufactures over 500 different part numbers and our team of engineers are constantly designing, building and testing new air intake systems.                     K & N starts with the largest conical shaped high-flow air filter that fits into the engine compartment using factory holes and mounting points. This extra filter size provides even more airflow at lower restriction than a standard K & N O/E replacement filter that is limited to the size of the factory air box. The oversized air filter also captures and holds more dirt increasing the service life before a cleaning is required (up to 100,000 miles).                     K & N air intakes are very easy to install on your car or truck. A typical air intake installation can be done with a screwdriver, pliers and a ratchet-set in 90 minutes or less! K & N specifically engineers their intake kits to use existing factory holes and mounting points, making installation simple. The vast majority of K & N cold air induction systems do not require any cutting or drilling.         >                                                                            < p>                     >                                                                            < p>                     >                                                                            < p>                             Protect Your Engine                 State-of-the-art filtration system features thousands of microscopic cotton fibers.
