experience measurement questionnaire in a clinical setting patient experience has emerged as an important metric for quality of healthcare a number of separate concepts have been used to measure patient experience but psychological research suggests that subjective experience is actually a composite of several independent concepts including a evaluation/valence b potency/control c activity/arousal and d novelty the present research evaluates the reliability of a multidimensional patient experience measurement questionnaire in a clinical setting a multidimensional semantic differential questionnaire was developed to measure the four underlying semantic dimensions of patient experience mentioned above a group of 60 patients used the questionnaire to assess prescan expectations and postscan experience of a magnetic resonance scan data for one patient were deleted because their scan was interrupted results revealed more positive evaluation/valence higher potency/control and lower activity/arousal for postscan ratings compared to prescan expectations ratings of novelty were neutral in both the prescan and the postscan conditions subsequent analysis suggested that internal consistency for some concepts could be improved by replacing several specific rating scales present results provide evidence of the utility and reliability of a multidimensional semantic questionnaire for measuring patient experience in an actual clinical setting recommendations to improve internal consistency for the concepts potency/control activity/arousal and novelty were also provided the traditional metric for quality of medical care has been clinical outcomes with the advent of the affordable care act however patient satisfaction has risen to prominence as a metric for healthcare quality hospital consumer assessment 2015 but see also jenkinson coulter bruster 2002 ware snyder wright davies 1983 with this growing emphasis on patients subjective response to clinical settings interest has also grown in understanding the factors that influence patients subjective experience global metrics such as the hospital consumer assessment of healthcare providers and systems hcahpss hospital consumer assessment 2015 are aimed at a high-level understanding of the entire hospital stay or visit as such they may not be suitable for informing design decisions at a detailed level in fact the hcahps fact sheet healthcare consumer assessment 2015 specifically recommends against using the questionnaire to make within-hospital comparisons design research intended to inform design decisions at a detailed level has used a variety of measures to quantify patients subjective response to environmental manipulations these include satisfaction e.g. quan joseph ensign 2012 comfort okken van rompay pruyn 2013 rathert williams mccaughey ishquaidef 2012 stress and anxiety fenko loock 2014 laursen danielsen rosenberg 2014 spielberger gorsuch lushane 1970 positive distraction hartig korpela evans g€arling 1997 laumann gärling stormark 2001 pain robinson green 2015 a sense of environmental control lee brand 2005 and willingness to recommend to others quan et al. 2012 given this variety of measures one might ask which is most appropriate in any given circumstance defining a minimal set of meaningful metrics would be both helpful and parsimonious given this variety of measures one might ask which is most appropriate in any given circumstance osgood suci and tannebaum 1957 used a battery of bipolar attribute rating scales so-called semantic differential scales to measure subjective response to a variety of sensory stimuli and concepts using a factor analytic technique they found that attributes consistently clustered into three primary categories evaluation positive vs. negative valence potency strength or effectiveness and activity speed or intensity osgood et al 1957 argued for a multidimensional conceptual framework in which experience is described by a composite of three semantic dimensions rather than a single concept the semantic differential technique has a fairly long history of use in applied contexts to measure subjective responses mindak 1961 it has been refined for practical purposes to provide design guidance by correlating product features with specific semantic qualities e.g. chuang chang hsu 2001 chuang ma 2001 hsiao chen 1997 kleiss georgiev and robinson 2012 adapted the semantic differential technique for use in a medical context to relate auditory device signals to the medical messages they were intended to indicate based on common semantic meaning using a factor analytic technique they replicated the three semantic factors of evaluation potency and activity identified by osgood et al 1957 plus a fourth factor related to novelty or familiarity kleiss and ouyang 2014 extended the semantic differential technique to measurement of patients experience in the context of a variety of simulated mammography exam rooms that differed in such qualities as color room size type of lighting and acoustic properties using a factor analytic technique they replicated osgood et al. s 1957 three basic semantic dimensions of evaluation potency and activity plus an additional fourth dimension of novelty using a factor analytic technique they replicated osgood et al. s 1957 three basic semantic dimensions of evaluation potency and activity plus an additional fourth dimension of novelty the purpose of the present research was to evaluate the use of a semantic differential technique to measure patients experience in an actual clinical setting the clinical setting of interest was a magnetic resonance mr imaging scan patients undergoing an mr scan may experience stress and discomfort due to uncertainty regarding possible disease conditions as well as to the foreign nature of the clinical environment itself the ability to reliably measure patient experience on all relevant dimensions of experience is an important precursor to effectively evaluating the impact of specific design manipulations on each independent dimension of experience the research protocol and materials were reviewed and approved by the affinity health system institutional review board irb00003490 appleton wi the participants were 60 patients scheduled for routine mr scans at st. elizabeth hospital in appleton there was no attempt to screen patients for participation in the study other than that participation was voluntary indicated by signing a consent form and that patients had to be fluent in english in order to fill out the questionnaire patients provided basic demographic information but no protected health information the data for one patient were deleted because the patient s scan was interrupted patient demographic data are summarized in table 1 one can see that there was a wide range of age represented and that there were approximately twice as many females as males patients received scans for a variety of medical purposes although the largest proportion of scans was for orthopedic issues data regarding the medical purpose of the exam were collected by the technologists who conducted the exam and were not associated with any identifying patient information these data were secured by the clinic and not made available to the author table 1 participant demographic information table 1 participant demographic information all data were collected in the patient waiting area of an mr scan suite the mr scan suite was isolated from the larger clinic and the patient waiting area was separate from the room in which the mr scan was conducted neither the mr scanning device nor the interior details of the scan room were visible from the patient waiting area the prescan ratings were taken after the patient had signed the consent form but before they had entered the mr scan room the postscan ratings were taken after the patient had completed their scan and had returned to the patient waiting area the bipolar semantic differential rating scales used by kleiss and ouyang 2014 to assess mammography patients experience of simulated mammography exam rooms were adapted for use with this more diverse sample of patients table 2 shows the bipolar attribute pairs from kleiss and ouyang 2014 organized according to the factors on which they loaded most heavily in the factor analysis that was performed on the semantic differential ratings attributes at the top of each column have the largest factor loadings osgood et al 1957 recommend that three bipolar attribute pairs be chosen for each semantic concept being measured the attributes that were chosen to be retained from the study of kleiss and ouyang 2014 are indicated by asterisks only two attribute pairs were retained for the novelty factor and an additional pair interesting/uninteresting was added with the intent of capturing the common underlying concept of interest that new phenomena may elicit only two attribute pairs were retained for the potency factor and an additional pair insecure/confident was added with the intent of capturing the common underlying concept of security and confidence three new attribute pairs were chosen for the activity factor with the intent of capturing the common underlying concept of stimulation and arousal the final set of 12 bipolar attribute pairs is shown in table 3 organized by the semantic concept they are intended to measure the sequential order of attributes as well as the polarity of the bipolar anchors left vs. right was randomized for presentation to patients to avoid response bias the randomized order is shown in table 4 table 2 bipolar attribute factor structure for mammography patients table 2 bipolar attribute factor structure for mammography patients table 3 bipolar semantic attribute pairs grouped by semantic concept table 3 bipolar semantic attribute pairs grouped by semantic concept table 4 randomized order of bipolar semantic attribute pairs table 4 randomized order of bipolar semantic attribute pairs the attribute pairs served as anchors for 7-point bipolar attribute semantic differential rating scales following osgood et al 1957 the middle point on each rating scale was anchored with the word neither indicating a neutral experience in which neither attribute applied proceeding outward the three points on either side of the neutral point were anchored with words slightly quite and extremely indicating increasingly greater agreement with the attribute at the corresponding end point of each rating scale the format of one bipolar attribute rating scale is shown in figure 1 the verbal anchors for the individual rating points were shown above the first rating scale only figure 1 example of a bipolar attribute rating scale with anchors all 12 rating scales appeared on a single sheet of paper preceded in the case of the prescan condition by two paragraphs describing the purpose of the study plus a description of how to fill out the rating scales these instructions are shown in appendix a the postscan data sheet was printed on a separate page and contained the same 12 ratings scales preceded by the instructional paragraph shown in appendix b upon entering the patient waiting area of the mr scan room patients were asked if they would volunteer to fill out a questionnaire to assess their experience during their scan those who volunteered were given a consent form to read and sign and then the prescan data sheet containing instructions for filling out the prescan ratings scales prescan ratings asked the patient to evaluate their expected experience during the scan barclay and thumin 1963 provide evidence that semantic differential rating scales are effective for evaluating hypothetical entities such as the personality characteristics of hypothetical individuals the intent was for ratings of expected experience to provide a benchmark against which to compare ratings of the actual scan experience to further familiarize patients with the rating procedure they were also shown a hypothetical example consisting of two bipolar semantic differential rating scales marked to show how to indicate similarities and differences in the taste of two types of coffee a common experience familiar to most patients the clinical routine of the scan was not otherwise altered except that patients were returned to the waiting area after their scan to fill out the postscan rating scales bipolar semantic differential ratings were transcribed from the paper data sheets to a spreadsheet application for further analysis the middle point on each rating scale was coded with the numeric value 0. proceeding left from the middle point points were coded −1 −2 and −3 successively proceeding right from the middle point points were coded 1 2 and 3 successively following initial data entry the polarity of the values for three rating scales was reversed so that all three rating scales within the same semantic concept had consistent polarity this was accomplished by multiplying the original scores by the value −1 the bipolar attribute pairs that were reversed were sheltered/exposed reversed to exposed −3 /sheltered +3 interesting/uninteresting reversed to uninteresting −3 /interesting +3 and unusual/routine reversed to routine −3 /unusual +3 the scores for the three rating scales within each semantic concept were then averaged to produce a single mean score for each of the four semantic concepts for each patient the scores were then averaged across patients within each of the four semantic concepts for each of the prescan and postscan conditions the four means that describe semantic experience for a given condition can be visualized as a profile by charting the means in a line graph the profiles for the prescan and postscan conditions are shown in figure 2 for clarity the three attributes associated with each pole of each semantic concept are shown grouped above and below each corresponding mean the semantic concept to which each group of attributes belongs is shown above the attributes figure 2 semantic profiles for the prescan and postscan conditions one can see in figure 2 that the two profiles are globally similar slightly high in evaluation friendly/welcoming/pleasing slightly high in potency confident/sheltered/protected slightly low in activity relaxing/still/calming and neutral with regard to novelty postscan ratings tend to be more positive in evaluation higher in potency and lower in activity than prescan ratings a series of t -tests was conducted to provide support for the above observations the first set of t -tests assessed possible differences between the mean ratings in the prescan and postscan conditions compared to the zero middle point on the rating scales results are shown in table 5 there is a trend for all means to be positive in evaluation high in potency and low in activity means did not deviate significantly from zero for novelty table 5. t -tests for differences from zero table 5. t -tests for differences from zero a second set of t -tests assessed possible differences between the prescan and postscan ratings results are shown in table 6 postscan ratings tended to be more positive in evaluation higher in potency and lower in activity than those in the prescan condition there was no difference between prescan and postscan ratings of novelty table 6. t -tests for the difference between prescan and postscan ratings table 6. t -tests for the difference between prescan and postscan ratings a key criterion for measuring psychological concepts is that the rating scales chosen to measure the concept do so consistently to assess the internal consistency of the present rating scales each set of the three rating scales was submitted to a factor analysis using the varimax rotation factor analysis assesses the degree to which a set of measurements are associated with a common underlying construct or factor there are two major criteria a that the rating scales all load on a single common factor and b that the internal consistency of the rating scales measured by cronbach s α coefficient is high nunnally and bernstein 1994 recommend a minimum cronbach s α coefficient of at least .700 for acceptable internal consistency separate analyses were performed on the ratings for each semantic concept within each of the prescan and postscan conditions results are summarized in table 7 table 7 factor loadings and cronbach s α coefficients for bipolar attribute pairs within each semantic concept table 7 factor loadings and cronbach s α coefficients for bipolar attribute pairs within each semantic concept results in table 7 show that the rating scales used to measure the semantic concept of evaluation annoying/pleasing forbidding/welcoming and impersonal/friendly all load on a single common factor in both the prescan and the postscan conditions the cronbach s α coefficients in both cases also exceed the critical value of .700 this provides evidence that these three rating scales reliably measure the semantic concept of evaluation the three attribute pairs intended to measure the semantic concept of potency vulnerable/protected insecure/confident and exposed/sheltered also load on a single common factor in both the prescan and the postscan conditions however the cronbach s α coefficient in the prescan condition is considerably smaller than the critical value of .700 examination of the factor loadings in the prescan condition reveals that the loading is much smaller for the exposed/sheltered attribute pair than it is for the other two attribute pairs this suggests that the exposed/sheltered attribute pair is not as highly associated with the underlying concept of potency as the other two attribute pairs the cronbach s α coefficient in the postscan condition does exceed the critical value of .700 and the factor loadings are large for all three attribute pairs this suggests that the experience of the mr scan itself provides additional context that clarifies the meaning of the exposed/sheltered attribute pair the three attribute pairs intended to measure the semantic concept of activity calming/invigorating relaxing/stimulating and still/lively all load on a single common factor in both the prescan and the postscan conditions the cronbach s α coefficient in the prescan condition .686 narrowly misses the critical value .700 whereas it exceeds the critical value in the postscan condition once again this suggests that the actual experience of the mr scan provides additional context that clarifies the meaning of the attributes it should be noted that factor loadings for the attribute pairs calming/invigorating and relaxing/stimulating increase considerably in the postscan condition whereas the factor loading for the still/lively attribute pair actually decreases somewhat taken together these results suggest that the reliability of the still/lively attribute pair for measuring the underlying semantic concept of activity is poorer than the other two attribute pairs results for the attribute pairs intended to measure the semantic concept of novelty unfamiliar/familiar unusual/routine and uninteresting/interesting exhibited mixed reliability in particular the uninteresting/interesting attribute pair diverged to form a second unique factor in the prescan condition suggesting that it does not measure the same underlying semantic concept as that being measured by the other two attribute pairs all attribute pairs loaded on a single common factor in the postscan condition but the uninteresting/interesting attribute pair had a small and negative factor loading therefore the uninteresting/interesting attribute pair does not appear to be a reliable measure of the underlying semantic concept of novelty in this context the primary goal of this research was to generalize a multidimensional semantic differential technique for measuring patient experience to an actual clinical setting the mr scan with a diverse sample of patients results revealed that patient experience was generally positive in evaluation friendly pleasing and welcoming high in potency protected confident and sheltered low in activity calming relaxing and still and neutral in novelty however experience after the scan was more positive in evaluation higher in potency and lower in activity than it was prior to the scan the average patient had experienced at least one prior scan see table 1 so the difference between prescan and postscan ratings is not due to mere inexperience with the mr scan procedure the room in which scans occurred was in a recently constructed addition to the clinic and had been outfitted with special lighting audio and video capability which could have influenced patients ratings on these three dimensions a key criterion in psychological measurement is that the rating scales intended to measure a psychological concept of interest do so consistently analyses of internal consistency revealed mixed results but pointed to opportunities for improvement the three rating scales used to measure the semantic concept of evaluation impersonal/friendly forbidding/welcoming and annoying/pleasing exhibited consistently high reliability and appear to provide good candidates for measuring the general concept of evaluation in clinical settings going forward the bipolar attribute pairs used to measure the semantic concept of potency vulnerable/protected insecure/confident and exposed/sheltered exhibited mixed internal consistency the exposed/sheltered attribute pair in particular showed poor internal consistency the exposed/sheltered attribute pair was selected with the intent of capturing an environmental distinction described by appleton 1975 between prospect an open space that provides opportunity and refuge an enclosed space that provides safety results suggest that this was not a particularly meaningful concept to patients prior to their mr scan it should be noted that the other two attribute pairs insecure/confident and vulnerable/protected appear to connote a slightly different meaning than exposed/sheltered capturing the subjective feeling of confidence or self-assuredness measurement reliability for the semantic concept of potency might therefore be improved by replacing the exposed/sheltered attribute pair with a pair that this is more closely aligned with the concept of confidence one possibility is uncertain/self-assured the three bipolar attributes used to measure the semantic concept of activity failed by a small margin to meet the criterion for internal consistency in the prescan condition but did so in the postscan condition the increase in reliability in the postscan condition was due mainly to larger factor loadings for the calming/invigorating and relaxing/stimulating attribute pairs the factor loading for the still/lively attribute pair actually decreased the attributes relaxing/stimulating and calming/invigorating describe feelings of arousal whereas the attributes still/lively describe movement although these are both aspects of activity it would appear that the feeling of arousal is most meaningful to patients in this context reliability for measuring the semantic concept of activity might therefore be improved with an attribute pair that is more closely aligned with the concept of arousal for example peaceful/agitated the three bipolar attribute pairs used to measure the concept of novelty unfamiliar/familiar unusual/routine and uninteresting/interesting also exhibited mixed internal consistency in particular the uninteresting/interesting attribute pair had a small and negative factor loading taken together this suggests that the uninteresting/interesting attribute pair is measuring a different underlying concept than is being measured by the other two attribute pairs the uninteresting/interesting attribute pair was chosen to capture an assumed quality of novel objects or events to attract attention and fascinate it does not appear that this quality of novelty was particularly meaningful to patients in the present context the attribute pairs routine/unusual and familiar/unfamiliar connote familiarity or typicality and an alternative attribute pair that is more aligned with that concept would be typical/uncommon the proposed changes discussed above are illustrated in table 8 table 8 proposed changes to bipolar semantic attribute pairs grouped by semantic concept table 8 proposed changes to bipolar semantic attribute pairs grouped by semantic concept a multidimensional conceptualization of patient experience has potential to integrate at least some of the diverse measures of patient experience that currently exist the commonly used concept of satisfaction hcahpss 2015 jenkinson et al. 2002 ware et al. 1983 has a connotation of positive versus negative valence that places it squarely within the domain of the semantic concept of evaluation therefore evaluation can accommodate current satisfaction measures as well as any other measures that imply valence osgood et al. s 1957 semantic concept of potency connotes strength or efficacy which appears related to the concept of control discussed by lee and brand 2005 the opposite of strength is weakness however because negative valence is captured by the evaluation dimension weakness in the context of the potency dimension should not be taken to have negative valence rather it simply connotes susceptibility to being controlled or perhaps a submissive/compliant attitude it is possible that patients might feel overly submissive in a clinical environment and that an enhanced sense of environmental security would be preferable to counteract that effect stress and anxiety have also been used as measures of patient experience spielberger et al. 1970 stress and anxiety have a clear connotation of negative valence and are therefore related to the semantic concept of evaluation however stress and anxiety also connote a certain high level of intensity or arousal which implies the semantic concept of activity stress and anxiety therefore might not be unique concepts in themselves but might reflect a combination of specific levels of evaluation and activity other apparently unique concepts might also reflect combinations of two or more basic semantic concepts for example boredom also appears to combine evaluation and activity/arousal but with a low levels of each one advantage of a semantic approach to patient experience is that it can integrate many disparate concepts within an overarching multidimensional framework one consequence of a multidimensional semantic conceptualization of patient experience is that any given design will have several criteria for acceptability not just one to this point it is important to note that not all of the semantic dimensions have a clearly preferred pole positive evaluation will always be desirable depending on preferences of the intended population of patients however an ideal design might be low neutral or high on other semantic dimensions even in the case of potency it is possible to conceive of a situation in which a strong and secure environment might be desirable for occupant security probably true in the present case or a submissive and easily manipulated environment might be desirable for occupant strength and control whether or not a particular environmental feature is perceived to be desirable will depend upon the state of the perceiver and their goals because of the lack of inherent valence for most semantic concepts it is difficult to anticipate what preferences a given population of patients might have without first assessing those preferences the present bipolar semantic differential rating scales provide two options for setting design goals anchored directly to patients experience one was exemplified in the present research by patients ratings of their own expected experience prior to the mr scan patients ratings of their expectations provide a quantitative criterion against which to compare ratings of the actual scan experience in the present case the actual scan showed a trend toward more positive evaluation higher potency and lower activity than prescan expectations more positive evaluation will always be desirable the potency dimension does not have inherent valence however the higher postscan potency scores reflect a greater perceived sense of security than was expected by patients prior to the exam and this seems like a desirable outcome activity also does not have inherent valence the lower postscan activity scores indicate that patients felt more relaxed still and calm after the scan than they expected prior to the scan and this also seems like a desirable outcome hence it would appear that the current facility exceeds patients expectations with regard to these dimensions of experience coates 2003 also describes a similar use of semantic differential rating scales to assess consumers ideal product profile consumers rated their hypothetical ideal product on a set of semantic differential ratings scales which then served as criteria against which to compare ratings of actual designs an alternative but less rigorous criterion for quantifying design intent is to reference design intent to the natural zero point that exists on the semantic differential rating scales here a simple directional statement such as low neutral or high will suffice to describe design intent correspondence to design intent can be readily assessed with prototypes or actual products/environments to the extent that one can assess a design against quantitative criteria for patient experience a question naturally arises regarding how to modify a design to move scores in a desired direction just as the full richness of patient experience can not be described by a single concept or metric no single design feature will be adequate to optimize experience on all semantic dimensions simultaneously indeed any given design feature might have a desirable effect on one semantic dimension of experience but have no effect or even an undesirable effect on others some guidance for choosing design features to influence specific semantic concepts in a desirable direction may be obtained by considering the specific meaning of the concepts for example evaluation reflects positive versus negative valence and any design feature that evokes liking or disliking will influence this dimension objectively it is difficult to say what specific physical features will influence evaluation in any given situation however coates 2003 describes a concept of objective concinnity which he associates with the classic aesthetic properties of harmony elegance and symmetry in the present case evaluation was probably also influenced by social factors related to staff interactions as captured by the attributes impersonal/friendly and forbidding/welcoming indeed semantic differentials are effective for evaluating personality characteristics barclay thumin 1963 and it might be unavoidable that such factors will influence certain dimensions of experience hence evaluation in a clinical context may well extend beyond the physical design of the clinical space itself potency implies effectiveness and control control may be viewed from two different perspectives depending upon the state of the occupant if the occupant seeks to control the environment then the environment must be submissive that is open reachable graspable in essence providing prospect in appleton s 1975 sense if the occupant feels submissive as patients might be assumed to feel then the environment must be sturdy and protective in essence providing refuge in appleton s 1975 sense the important point is that there is a reciprocal relationship between the occupant and the environment which environmental features prospect or refuge are best suited to those needs will depend upon the state of the patient/occupant activity literally reflects speed or movement but encompasses the general concept of arousal manipulating the intensity of any sensory factors will likely influence perceived activity however the complexity of the environment reflected in density of environmental elements texture contrasting elements and so on may also influence perceived activity novelty reflects familiarity but will vary from person to person depending upon one s own personal experience coates 2003 uses the concept of subjective concinnity to describe the correspondence between an external object or event and one s own expectations or ideal manipulating novelty is easy but risky one needs to only add new or unexpected features to an environment in order to obtain novelty however novelty comes with a risk in that too much novelty might be startling to occupants or seem too foreign therefore increasing novelty must be done with caution so as to balance the arousal of new experiences with the discomfort of excessive foreignness in this light it is interesting to note the patients in the present study expected a neutral experience of novelty and judged their actual experience to be neutral despite the presence of novel lighting audio and video features in the scan room to the extent that typical clinical features are perceived to be familiar by patients removing or replacing them will necessarily move the experience of novelty from familiar toward neutral however one might question the need for additional novelty beyond this point given the already desirable scores on the dimensions of evaluation potency and activity additional novelty might simply make the room seem too foreign the present research demonstrated the practical utility and reliability of a multidimensional semantic approach to measuring patient experience in a clinical setting based upon results recommendations were made to improve the measurement reliability for three of the four semantic dimensions these recommendations remain to be validated by future research a multidimensional semantic conceptualization of patient experience accommodates many of the disparate measurement concepts that currently exist in the literature and integrates them into a conceptual whole that is consistent with psychological theory an important implication of a multidimensional conceptualization of patient experience is that the full richness of patient experience can not be adequately described by any single measure regardless of its face validity but requires a complete profile of measures similarly a profile of different design features is required to influence experience on each dimension in the desired direction an important implication of a multidimensional conceptualization of patient experience is that the full richness of patient experience can not be adequately described by any single measure regardless of its face validity but requires a complete profile of measures similarly a profile of different design features is required to influence experience on each dimension in the desired direction to summarize the present semantic approach to measuring patient experience provides a convenient and reliable measurement technique that is based on psychological theory and captures the richness of underlying patient experience on multiple dimensions simultaneously it can also be conveniently administered in an actual clinical setting with a diverse sample of patients the full richness of underlying patient experience can be captured by the four underlying semantic dimensions of evaluation potency activity and novelty each dimension should be assessed with three corresponding bipolar attribute rating scales create a profile of scores by averaging the three bipolar attribute rating scales within each of the four semantic concepts reference profiles for design concepts or actual designs to patients estimates of expected or ideal experience to assess correspondence to design intent compare semantic profiles for two or more prototypes or concepts to identify points of similarity and difference and inform design changes to move experience in the intended direction st. elizabeth hospital is interested in improving how you feel while undergoing an mr scan please take a few minutes to indicate how
