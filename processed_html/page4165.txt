A rapidly growing family of genetic diseases is due to defects in protein and lipid glycosylation (congenital disorders of glycosylation [CDG]). Most CDGs are severe, multisystem diseases with prominent neurologic involvement. Nearly 100 CDGs have been identified. This chapter is limited to the protein glycosylation defects (some 80 disorders). Twenty-five CDGs are due to an  N -glycosylation defect ( Table 158-1 ). Twenty disorders have been identified in  O -glycosylation, including some long-known diseases such as hereditary multiple exostoses ( Table 158-2 ). Thirty-four disorders have a combined  N - and  O -glycosylation defect, including dolichol metabolism defects ( Table 158-3 ). Important tools in the diagnosis are serum transferrin (Tf) isoelectric focusing (IEF), serum apolipoprotein C-III (apo C-III) isoelectrofocusing, protein-linked glycan analysis, and genetic analysis. In this text, we use the nomenclature introduced in 2009, namely the official gene symbol (not in italics) followed by “-CDG.” CDGs are a rapidly growing family of genetic diseases caused by defects in the synthesis of the glycan moiety of glycoconjugates (glycoproteins and glycolipids). There are 2 main types of protein glycosylation:  N -glycosylation and  O -glycosylation.  N -glycosylation ( N -glycans attached to an amino group of asparagine of proteins) comprises an assembly part and a processing part and extends over 3 cellular compartments: the cytosol, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the Golgi. The assembly part of the  N -glycosylation starts on the cytosolic side of the ER, with the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) phosphate from UDP-GlcNAc to membrane-bound dolichyl monophosphate (Dol-P), forming GlcNAc-pyrophosphate-dolichol (GlcNAc-PP-Dol). One GlcNAc and 5 mannose (Man) residues are subsequently attached to this lipid-linked monosaccharide in a stepwise manner ( Fig. 158-1 ). The donor of these mannoses is a nucleotide-activated sugar, GDP-Man, which is synthesized from fructose 6-phosphate, an intermediate of the glycolytic pathway ( Fig. 158-2 ). The lipid-linked heptasaccharide Man 5 GlcNAc 2  is translocated by a flippase across the ER membrane and is elongated at the lumenal side by the attachment of 4 mannose residues and subsequently of 3 glucose residues. The 3 mannosyltransferases and 3 glucosyltransferases involved require dolichyl-phosphate-bound monosaccharides (Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc). The completed Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2  oligosaccharide is then transferred to selected asparagine residues of the nascent proteins by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex.

The processing part of the  N -glycosylation starts in the ER by trimming the glucose residues (catalyzed by glucosidases I and II) and 1 mannose (catalyzed by α-mannosidase I). The residual glycoprotein intermediate is directed to the cis-Golgi, where the processing pathway branches. A minor branch targets glycoproteins to the lysosomes (after the action of a GlcNAc-phosphotransferase and removal of the GlcNAc residues, leaving high-mannose glycoproteins capped with Man 6-P). The main branch leads to further trimming of mannoses (leaving a trimannosyl core) and the addition of GlcNAc, galactose, and, eventually, sialic acid in the medial- and trans-Golgi. Another modification of many  N -glycoproteins in the Golgi is the attachment of fucose to the GlcNAc residue that is linked to asparagine. O -glycosylation ( O -glycans attached to the hydroxyl group of threonine or serine of proteins) has no processing part and thus consists only of assembly. Unlike  N -glycosylation, this assembly mainly occurs in the Golgi.  O -glycan structures show a greater diversity than  N -glycans. Examples of important  O -glycans are  O-N -acetylgalactosaminylglycans (mucin-type glycans),  O -xylosylglycans (glycosaminylglycans),  O- mannosyl glycans, and  O -fucosylglycans. Twenty-five diseases are known in protein  N -glycosylation: 22 assembly defects (CDG-I group) and 3 processing defects (CDG-II group). Here we discuss only the most frequent disorders, PMM2-CDG, ALG1-CDG, ALG6-CDG, and MPI-CDG, in some detail, since all the other diseases are very rare. The latter are summarized in  Table 158-1 . 608776 263210 IEF, isoelectric focusing; Tf, transferrin. See text for other abbreviations. PMM2-CDG (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [MIM] no. 212065) is by far the most frequent protein  N -glycosylation disorder (> 700 patients are known worldwide). The clinical spectrum is very broad. The nervous system is affected in all patients, and most other organs are involved in variable ways. The neurologic picture comprises alternating internal strabismus and other abnormal eye movements, axial hypotonia, psychomotor disability, ataxia, and hyporeflexia. After infancy, symptoms include retinitis pigmentosa, stroke-like episodes, and sometimes epilepsy. During the first year(s) of life, there are variable feeding problems (anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea) that can result in severe failure to thrive. Other features are a variable dysmorphism (large, hypoplastic/dysplastic ears, abnormal subcutaneous adipose tissue distribution [fat pads, inverted nipples]), mild to moderate hepatomegaly, skeletal abnormalities (including atlantoaxial subluxation), and hypogonadism. Some infants develop pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy. At the other end of the clinical spectrum are patients with a very mild phenotype (no dysmorphism, mild psychomotor disability). Patients often have an extroverted and happy appearance. There is a substantially increased mortality in the first years of life due to vital organ involvement or severe infection. PMM2-CDG is a (cytosolic) defect in the second step of the mannose pathway (transforming mannose-6-phosphate into mannose-1-phosphate), which normally leads to the synthesis of guanosine diphosphate ( GDP )-mannose (see  Fig. 158-2 ). This nucleotide sugar is the donor of mannose used in the ER to assemble the dolichol-pyrophosphate oligosaccharide precursor. Deficiency of GDP-mannose causes hypoglycosylation of numerous glycoproteins, including serum proteins, lysosomal enzymes, and membranous glycoproteins. PMM2-CDG is an autosomal recessive disease due to mutations of  PMM2  on chromosome 16p13. Some 100 mutations have been identified (mainly missense mutations), the most frequent being the R141H mutation. Prenatal diagnosis is possible by enzymatic analysis of amniocytes and chorionic villus cells; this should be combined with mutation analysis of the  PMM2  gene. The diagnosis of PMM2-CDG (and of congenital disorders of  N -glycosylation in general) is usually made by IEF and immunofixation of serum transferrin (see  Fig. 158-1 ). Normal serum transferrin is mainly composed of tetrasialotransferrin and small amounts of mono-, di-, tri-, penta-, and hexasialotransferrins. The partial deficiency of sialic acid (a negatively charged and end-standing sugar) in CDG causes a cathodal shift. Two main types of cathodal shift can be recognized: Type 1 is characterized by an increase of both disialo- and asialotransferrin and a decrease of tetrasialotransferrin; in type 2, there is also an increase of the tri- and/or monosialotransferrin bands ( Fig. 158-3 ). In PMM2 deficiency, a type 1 pattern is found. Recently, capillary zone electrophoresis of total serum has been introduced for the diagnosis of CDG (see  Fig. 158-1 ). In addition to the previously mentioned serum glycoprotein abnormalities, laboratory findings include elevation of serum transaminase levels, hypoalbuminemia, hypocholesterolemia, and renal tubular proteinuria. To confirm the diagnosis, the activity of PMM2 should be measured in leukocytes or fibroblasts.

The figures on the left indicate the number of sialic acid residues on each sialotransferrin fraction. Some 25 patients with MPI-CDG (MIM no. 602579) have been reported with this mainly hepatic-intestinal disease. Together with ALG8-CDG, it is the only known  N -linked CDG without (or with only minor) neurologic involvement. Symptoms start in the first year of life and consist of various combinations of recurrent vomiting, abdominal pain, protein-losing enteropathy, recurrent thromboses, gastrointestinal bleeding, liver disease, and symptoms of hypoglycemia. Several patients have died. The defect is in the first step in the biosynthesis of the nucleotide sugar GDP-mannose (see  Fig. 158-2 ). The substrate of the enzyme, fructose 6-phosphate, does not accumulate, since it is an intermediate of the glycolytic pathway. The blood biochemical abnormalities are indistinguishable from those found in PMM2-CDG. Inheritance of MPI-CDG is autosomal recessive. The gene ( PMI ) has been localized to chromosome 15q22, and several (missense) mutations have been identified. Prenatal diagnosis is possible. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding a decreased activity of phosphomannose isomerase in leukocytes or fibroblasts and/or mutation(s) in the  MPI  gene. This is the only known CDG that can be effectively treated. The treatment is simple and consists of oral mannose (1 g/kg body weight per day, divided in 4–6 doses). The rationale for this treatment is that hexokinases phosphorylate mannose to mannose 6-phosphate, thus bypassing the defect. Fifty-four patients have been reported with ALG6-CDG (MIM no. 603147). As in PMM2-CDG, patients show hypotonia, strabismus, and seizures, but psychomotor development is less affected, there is less dysmorphism, and there is usually no retinitis pigmentosa or cerebellar hypoplasia. In 1 patient, idiopathic intracranial hypertension and optic atrophy were reported. For an unknown reason, some of the glycoproteins have unusually low blood levels (particularly factor XI and coagulation inhibitors such as  antithrombin  and protein C). The reason why the clinical picture in these patients is milder than that of PMM2-deficient patients may be because a deficiency in glucosylation of the dolichol-linked oligosaccharides does not affect the biosynthesis of GDP-mannose; therefore, it does not affect the biosynthesis of GDP-fucose or of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoproteins. Glucosyltransferase I deficiency is a defect in the attachment of the first glucose (of 3) to the dolichol-linked mannose 9 - N -acetylglucosamine 2  ER intermediate. It causes hypoglycosylation of serum glycoproteins because nonglucosylated oligosaccharides are a suboptimal substrate for oligosaccharyltransferase. ALG6-CDG is an autosomal recessive disease. The gene has been localized to chromosome 1p22.3. Prenatal diagnosis is possible. This disease illustrates that even in cases of mild psychomotor disability without any specific dysmorphism, IEF of serum sialotransferrins should be performed. When a type 1 pattern is found, PMM2 and PMI deficiency must be considered first. If these enzymes show normal activities, the next step is genetic analysis (CDG panel analysis or whole-exome sequencing). Fifty-seven patients with ALG1-CDG (MIM no. 608540) have been reported. Its phenotype is predominantly neurologic involvement. Constant features are developmental disabilities and hypotonia. A majority of patients show dysmorphism, microcephaly, intractable seizures, visual disturbances, tremor, ataxia, severe infections, and cerebral abnormalities. Survival of the reported patients ranged from 2 days to over 20 years. ALG1 attaches the first of 9 mannoses to GlcNAc 2 -PP-Dol at the outside of the ER membrane. Laboratory abnormalities comprise decreased levels of serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, factor XI, and antithrombin and increased serum transaminases. Inheritance is autosomal recessive. Thirteen variants have been reported in the  ALG1  gene. Serum Tf IEF shows a type 1 pattern. The diagnosis has to be confirmed by mutation analysis of  ALG1 . Twenty genetic diseases have been identified in protein  O -glycosylation. The most frequent is hereditary multiple exostoses, which is one of the 3 known CDGs with autosomal dominant inheritance. The others are summarized in  Table 158-2 . 236670 609308 613155 613150 613156 613158 253280 613151 613157 This disease is characterized by osteochondromas of the ends of long bones. These tumors are often present at birth; their growth slows during adolescence and stops in adulthood. Malignant degeneration is present in only a small percentage of the lesions. Complications may result from compression of peripheral nerves and blood vessels. Treatment is only necessary when there are complications or (rare) malignant degeneration. Prognosis is usually good. The basic defect is in the Golgi-localized EXT1/EXT2 complex, which has both glucuronyltransferase and  N -acetyl-D-hexosaminyltransferase activities involved in the polymerization of heparan sulfate. Transmission of hereditary multiple exostoses (MIM no. 608177 and 608210) is autosomal dominant. The diagnosis is based on mutation analysis of the  EXT  genes. Thirty-four genetic diseases have been identified with a combined  N - and  O -glycosylation defect. The most frequent is hereditary inclusion body myopathy. The others are summarized in  Table 158-3 . 269921 600737 605820 219200 278250 COG, conserved oligomeric Golgi complex; Tf, transferrin. See text for other abbreviations. The disease is characterized by adult-onset, progressive distal and proximal muscle weakness. Patients eventually become wheelchair-bound in 2 to 3 decades, but remarkably, the quadriceps muscles are spared. The defect is in the first 2 steps of the sialic acid synthesis catalyzed by UDP-GlcNAc epimerase/kinase. Inheritance of recessive hereditary inclusion body myopathy (MIM no. 600737) is autosomal recessive. The diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis. An effective treatment is available only for MPI-CDG (oral mannose; see above). There is a partial treatment for PIGM-CDG (oral butyrate controls seizures), SLC35C1-CDG (oral fucose controls infections), PGM1-CDG (galactose improves liver function and endocrine abnormalities and reduces hypoglycemic episodes), PGM3-CDG (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation corrects neutropenia and lymphopenia), and the CDGs that can present as a congenital myasthenic syndrome, namely DPAGT1-CDG, ALG2-CDG, ALG14-CDG, GFPT1-CDG, and GMPPB-CDG (cholinesterase inhibitors).                         This div only appears when the trigger link is hovered over.                        Otherwise it is hidden from view.
