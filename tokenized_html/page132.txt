particular interest not only because of the pathogenic potential for this animal species but also due to its relevance with regard to public health on basis of the profile of resistance to antimicrobials 13 salmonella strains were selected which belonged to the serovars muenster 7 derby 4 typhimurium 1 and braenderup 1 they were isolated from healthy swine as well as from the abattoir environment in the state of rio de janeiro all strains of salmonella were subjected to bacterial conjugation and the e. coli k12 nal r lac f standard strain was used as receptor with the purpose to verify the ability to transfer the resistance marks gene transfer phenomenon was detected in seven strains and except salmonella typhimurium which transconjugated to sm tc and su the remaining ones

salmonella serovars other than those related to disease are being identified in clinically healthy swine by the time of slaughter costa et al 1972 zebral et al 1974 l zaro et al 1997 this fact has implications on public health in so far as a considerable number of such serovars are also isolated from outbreaks of human salmonellosis hofer reis 1994 lirio et al 1998 its significance does not only lie on the attributes of virulence but also on the capability of resistance to antimicrobials shown by some strains as well as of the transfer of this feature through plasmids ishiguro et al 1980 simmons et al 1988 heffernan 1991 the quick and widespread drug-resistance mediated by plasmidial genes in salmonella isolates has been reported worldwide during the past few decades various countries have witnessed a significant increase in human isolates of multiresistant salmonellae holmberg et al 1984 carvalho hofer 1989 rivera et al 1991 asensi hofer 1994 ling et al.1998 as well as animal isolates hampton et al 1995 millemann et al 1995 alaniz et al 1997 izumiya et al 2001 of particular interest is the fact that most plasmids acquire their resistance genes through transposons whether from an other plasmid in the strain from the chromosome or plasmids carried by other bacterial strains which are present in the host threlfall frost 1990 in the light of this research was carried out which concentrated essentially on r factors of salmonella by means of conjugation tests timoney 1978 vinhas almeida 1984 simmons et al 1988 sant'ana et al 1995 in view of the complexity of the factors associated with the dissemination of resistant salmonella strains this paper has the purpose of assessing the capability to transfer marks of resistance to antimicrobials by means of bacterial conjugation as well as by analysis of the plasmidial profile of salmonella isolated from clinically healthy swine and also originating from the environment where these animals were slaughtered in the state of rio de janeiro materials and methods for the conjugation experiments 7 samples were selected belonging to serovar muenster 4 samples of serovar derby one belonging to serovar typhimurium and one to serovar braenderup these were isolated from swine and the abattoir environment they were resistant and/or multiresistant to sulphonamide su streptomycin sm and tetracycline tc table 1 conjugation experiments for the determination of r factors in the samples under study the methodology used was the one described by dias hofer 1985 conjugation was performed using as recipient escherichia coli k12 55 f lac nal r susceptible to all drugs except nalidix acid transconjugants were seleted on macconkey agar oxoid containing the antimicrobials to which the standard strain was originally sensitive the resistance patterns of transconjugant strains was confirmed through the disc diffusion method according to nccls 1998 and considering the original profile of the corresponding donor colony plasmidial analysis the analysis of the plasmidial contents regarding the original strains and their respective transconjugants was performed by the alkaline lysis method of birnboim doly 1979 modified by sambrok et al 1989 the plasmidial dnas of e. coli v 517 and 29r861 were included as molecular weight controls results table 2 shows the conjugation positivity in seven 53.84 out of the 13 donor strains which evidences the total transference of model su tc sm on s typhimurium and partial transfer of mark su in regard to serovars derby and muenster regarding the transfer degree determined in salmonellae by view of the growth of transconjugant samples in dilutions 10ยบ 10 -1 and 10 -2 it was found that from the seven transconjugants the isolation of transconjugating up to dilution 10 -2 was obtained only with s. typhimurium the others were characterized by reaching up to dilution 10 -1 the antimicrobial susceptibility tests confirmed the transfer of resistance marks in all of the transconjugant strains in table 3 are listed plasmids transferred by the conjugation process between salmonella donor and receptor e. coli k12 55 lr1 despite the donor serovars muenster and derby which showed resistance transfer to mark su for e. coli the analysis of plasmidial dna in transconjugant samples did not reveal plasmids which were evidenced in the donor samples regarding s. typhimurium strain no 76 marks tc sm and su were transferred and the analysis of transconjugants fig 1 revealed the presence of plasmids showing approximate sizes kb of 63-3.75 and 3.45 kb for transconjugant sm t76sm x lr1 and only the 63 kb plasmid on transconjugants tc and su t76 c x lr1 and t76su x lr1 it is noteworthy that the antimicrobial susceptibility test in order to confirm transfer of r factors revealed simultaneous resistance to marks sm tc and su in the three transconjugants resulting from s. typhimurium discussion the information contained in the literature points out the transfer of genes among bacteria by means of conjugation in varied environments as well as in the intestinal tracts of humans and animals smith 1969 although laboratorial experiments do not exactly reproduce even under simulated conditions the complexity existing in transfer processes occurring in vivo they may constitute an important tool for making such inferences the negative result in the conjugation of the six salmonella muenster strains as well as the absence of transconjugants for marks sm in s. muenster no 8 and sm tc in s derby may be related to one of the following features the genic-chromosomic feature of these determinants the non-existence of the transfer factor the interference of nalidixic acid with selective plates for transconjugants the inability of plasmid reception of the standard strain used barbour 1967 or even plasmid loss during handling of the samples the hypothesis is also admitted that these strains carry thermo-sensitive plasmids r encoding a resistance to tc and sm which are effectively transferred at 25ยบ c. factors related to resistance to tetracycline seem to be effectively transferred outside the body thereby decreasing transfer at 37ยบc timoney 1978 this may account for the difficulty of in vivo transfer on the part of plasmids bearing resistance of animal origin into the flora residing in man 's intestine smith 1969 a wide distribution of thermo-sensitive plasmid in salmonellae isolated from swine was noted by ishiguro et al 1980 in japan analyzing table 3 it was found that only s. typhimurium was capable of transferring r- plasmid to e. coli the close association between marks su tc sm along with the finding of simultaneous transfer to s. typhimurium transconjugants suggests that such genic expression may be determined by the same plasmid 63 kb although there have been detected two additional plasmids 3.75 and 3.45 kb on transconjugant sm of s. typhimurium t76sm x lr1 this feature is found in the literature in so far a non-conjugating plasmid may be transferred to a receptor cell by cooperative action of a conjugative plasmid when they are present in the same cell with regard to plasmids with relatively high molecular weights and encoding resistance to antimicrobials in salmonella typhimurium these appears to exist a 40 kb plasmid associated to resistance to amoxicilin streptomycin tetracycline chloranphenicol and sulfametoxazol-trimetroprin hansen et al 1964 and another 80 kb plasmid encoding resistance to marks ap sm su tc hampton et al 1995 as to the absence of plasmids in transconjugants of s muenster and s. derby the hypothesis can scarcely be admitted that the determinant of resistance to mark su is encoded by a large plasmid which has not been demonstrated through the methodology employed for this purpose various methods and procedures were set forth the outstanding being the one developed by kado liu 1981 which is the most convenient for extraction in view of plasmids with high molecular weight another explanation for this phenomenon could be the outcome of integration of the resistance-plasmid in the receptor 's chromosome madigan et al 1997 or still because of the poor stability during the storage period between tests the ease of in vitro transfer has led to the conclusion that similar pattern of resistance to antibiotics in different intestinal bacteria are mediated by the same resistance plasmid r factor and has the same origin cherubin 1981 in contrast avril et al 1977 have shown that the same resistance pattern is expressed by different episomes and in the same way in different salmonella serovars whenever a salmonella bearer is being treated with antibiotics and the microorganism develops a multi-resistance similar resistance pattern may be found in the patient 's intestinal flora aserkoff bennett 1969 the genic transfer phenomenon observed in the samples which are the object of our study emphasizes the relevance of those factors in propagating resistant bacteria in different ecological niches besides the progressive limitations in the therapeutics using antimicrobials mostly when the level of resistance to isolates is
