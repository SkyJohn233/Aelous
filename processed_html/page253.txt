The Life and Times of a Contemporary New England Witch: April 2013 Many people can relate to the 'witch' in October. When the leaves change color, the air becomes crisp and Halloween is just around the corner. I've created this blog as a doorway into the life of a real witch who lives in New England, year round. An insiders look behind the creaky door of the haunted house of my life, where I am a witch 24/7 - 365. My name is Faith McCann and I will be writing a new post weekly. I hope you like my work.
