sports-cricket comment clock sports-cricket comment clock another nrl season is now over and as the realisation dawns on many fans that they won t get a chance to whinge about the refs for another six months the only comfort i can offer is that it also means it s time revisit my fearless predictions sports-rugby-league comment clock sports-rugby-league comment clock the nrl season is sadly over with the sydney roosters claiming the premiership on sunday night unfortunately under controversial circumstances sports-rugby-league comment clock sports-rugby-league comment clock as the sydney

sounded due to the realisation that a grand final between two interstate teams was an impossibility sports-rugby-league comment clock sports-rugby-league comment clock last week i did something embarrassing and out of character unfortunately after years of ripping into people that rip into referees i inadvertently did the exact same thing sports-rugby-league comment clock sports-rugby-league

been told there is no such thing as a stupid idea but i assure you that s not true sports-rugby-league comment clock sports-rugby-league comment clock i rate england test skipper joe root highly as a batsman but i ve always found it a bit silly that he often gets included in the same sentence as virat kohli steve smith and kane williamson sports-cricket comment clock sports-cricket comment clock unless you ve been living under a rock you would know that melbourne storm hooker cameron smith played his record-setting 400th nrl game on saturday night sports-rugby-league comment clock sports-rugby-league comment clock after the opening game of the 2019 state of origin series and particularly after the announcement of the new south wales blues squad for game 2 coach brad fittler faced some intense media scrutiny how intense when even buzz rothfield – not a man prone to admitting he was wrong – is apologising it indicates sports-rugby-league comment clock sports-rugby-league

just after 6pm on sunday night sports-rugby-league comment clock sports-rugby-league comment clock every now and then you get asked a question for which the answer seems so blatantly obvious that you feel it s ridiculous it was even asked sports-basketball comment clock sports-basketball comment clock i ve waited a week to write down my thoughts on what the new south wales blues should do in response to their loss in the opening game of the state of origin series sports-rugby-league comment clock sports-rugby-league comment clock it was an innings few australian cricket fans will forget for a variety of different reasons i refer to of course andrew symonds brilliant 143 not out versus pakistan in australia s opening game of the 2003 world cup in south africa sports-cricket comment clock sports-cricket comment clock oh great another piece about ben simmons and his jump shot or more specifically his lack of one surely it s all been said by now and there is nothing new to discuss on this topic sports-basketball comment clock sports-basketball comment clock the 2019 nrl season is in diapers still only weeks old and yet i m already being forced into saying something that i know i m going to get criticised for sports-rugby-league comment clock sports-rugby-league comment clock i love rugby league i have for a long time now sports-rugby-league comment clock sports-rugby-league comment clock chevron-right i wanted to not like this article but it s impossible it s actually very good and bang on kudos if afl clubs were nba franchises comment-fill sports-afl clock you ve spent a great deal of time and words discussing this and i appreciate the chat especially exposing a slight flaw in the thinking around relying on warner s average on home soil as the reason to select him i can keep this pretty simple i think warner s home record overall test numbers and shield century put him at the top of the list for the choices to open the batting in the first test you think his average on australian soil is largely irrelevant and want to drop him on account of his average/performance in the last test series picking on form by your very own rationale that also rules out bancroft and harris as well who performed at almost the same level as warner in the ashes renshaw is definitely out and probably khawaja too if you re a proponent of ignoring home averages so seriously who is opening the batting for australia with burns if not warner david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock small but important point he s not averaging 10 in tests he s averaging 46 i know you know this but he averaged 10 in england and that s simply not where the next tests are being played you think that last point should be ignored i don t. guess we re at impasse there but answer me this if warner scores another shield century before selection and no one else gets runs would you pick warner for the first test david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock actually i did mention which facts you ignored namely that if warner is going to be dropped then someone has to replace him and you didn t say who and still haven t incidentally i think that s the most important point there is more so than warner s home average the reason that number is even relevant is because it can become a tie-breaker of sorts when choosing between batsmen especially in the absence of anyone knocking down the door to replace him and given that the fact warner has the 5th highest average of all time in australia of those that have scored 1000+ runs is pretty salient rather than rancid logic nope not denying that warner is a serial knucklehead and has embarrassed his country on numerous occasions just not sure of its relevance when discussing the notion of perform or get dropped warner was terrible in england as you pointed out but so were the other openers no that puts them on level pegging i would argue but surely warner s experience and record gets his nose in front another contender is renshaw who has been nowhere in shield for over a year now which i d say rules him out too so the opposition for warner s spot is limited which brings his home record into play that s my point the other contender for mine was khawaja who averages 97 as a test opener albeit in a small sample size and i had actually dropped warner in my original piece for this article and had uzzy and burns opening but once khawaja failed and warner got a hundred things became pretty clear that warner should get first crack hopefully that answer in total answers your last question specifically that selectors will look at whatever information they need to make a choice including someone s impressive home record i hope and doubt it ever gets down to venue-by-venue selection and think that s a very big stretch from home record to venue-by-venue david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock i think you underestimate or just plain don t understand the power of the australian cricket selectors they are not sounding boards for the coach the selectors are selectors david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock you re being a little selective with your facts there as has been pointed out it s not just the fact that warner is great on home soil that ensures he deserves selection for starters you spent a lengthy comment disparaging warner but didn t actually mention who he should be dropped for that s kind of an important point here you can deserve it if there s no one more deserving you also think the logic is rancid of picking someone based on their previous record in relevant conditions let s flip that on its head then we won t pick someone despite the fact that evidence points to the fact he ll probably do well hhhmm i know which logic sounds more dubious to me calling warner a serial knucklehead probably revealed your irrational bias here and why you re choosing to ignore facts/numbers you just don t like warner that s fine and acceptable but just say that it s way more credible than trying to build a case for warner not to be picked based on his exceptional home record which is so nonsensical it was actually difficult to write david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock sadly we ve actually done a lot of that lately 36 would have seen you close to dropped from your shield side at one point slight hyperbole david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock my apologies i was quoting a stat from the time he was selected in the ashes series good correction don t disagree on the promising vs brilliant or the need for hundreds but that wasn t quite the point it was about him being labelled a lock and i think any young player in an era who averaged 50 in the previous series would be one david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock forget his overall test average he s still in the infancy of his career for that to be too big of a concern and look at his average in his last series against a quality attack away from home he averaged 50 plus he looked real solid doing it he was also the leading run scorer in all of county cricket he s then come back and scored 69 and 52 in the first shield game i m sorry but in any era that would have almost made him a lock and today s era it s almost enough to make him vice-captain david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock shaun marsh please no we ve seen this movie before david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock hahaha that may some merit the funniest thing is that even ronan called me ronan one day david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock considering there s not 10 or so batsmen averaging over 50 in shield like the good old days you could make a strong case for some left-field thinking like picking carey as a specialist bat personally i wouldn t i think he needs way more runs before that s a consideration but he s certainly next in line for paine s position david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock geez harsh marker he averaged over 50 in the ashes series and looked rock solid in doing so he also just scored 69 52 in the shield game you would hope that classifies you as a lock and that s before we even consider australia s lack of batting depth david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock are you advocating picking carey as a specialist batsman that would be a massive call for mine that century on an absolute highway was just his third first class hundred with an average of 33 surely there are plenty of batsmen options ahead of him in the queue david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock if he piles on another double hundred he might david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock or a paine boom tish david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock oh dear no comment for now i have another piece on the way on paine david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock haha i m actually a paine fan so that comment could open up a can of worms and a whole different discussion david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock as i said it s an interesting strategy and if you can bowl a team out so cheaply that you don t need the runs that 6 frontline batsmen can score then it has merit however i think it s too risky and unnecessary i m happy to back 3 quicks and lyon to do the job on australian wickets and think only picking 5 bats is just weakening a weakness david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock yep no arguments there david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock i don t disagree with that but after this ashes series is really the first time that warner s position has been under heavy threat/scrutiny emphasis on heavy there he s both lucky he survived but also lucky the players behind him aren t/weren t applying much pressure in the form of mountains of runs david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock well with a well-argued point like that i should probably reconsider my view david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock let s re-examine and re-post exactly what i said because it not only answers your questions but should squash any suggestion that it was bait however looking at the scorecard and highlights the junction oval wicket was an absolute road which unfortunately puts a small asterisk against harris century as crazy as it sounds he probably needed an unbeaten double hundred to gain any real kudos from that game david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock five quality bats could arguably do the job of scoring enough runs to win a test match problem is australia don t have 5 at the moment we have smith and maybe labuschange so we need to pick at least 6 batsman and no i wouldn t be picking marsh that s not what i was/am advocating david warner and joe burns should be the openers for the first test comment-fill sports-cricket clock our bowling hasn t really been an issue but you think we should pick 5 bowlers and leave us a batsman short when runs have been the biggest concern for australia for some time that s interesting david warner and joe
