watch ant-man and the wasp then watch these movies shrinking and enlarging effects have been around since the dawn of cinema marvel s ant-man and the wasp is just the latest in a long history of depicting the fantasy of changing size yet we re still amazed and amused by how the concept is executed on screen the easy thing to do for this week s list of movies to watch after would be to just recommend the most notable examples in this film history i d rather link out to crooked marquee s recent lesson and then highlight only the most relevant to the superhero blockbuster at hand plus there so many other kinds of movies worth recommending after you see the ant-man sequel there are specific titles that influenced director peyton reed there are other movies that seem to be referenced in tribute and there those that ant-man and the wasp made me personally think of while watching below is just a starting point with additional suggestions acknowledged within certain entries watch them chronologically for a tour through time and you ll get a sense of what came beforehand as always one of the best originators or early pioneers of a special effect is georges melies the magician-turned-filmmaker was all about cinematic trickery and his 1901 film the devil and the statue is typically brought up as an early example if not the first film to showcase the shrinking and enlarging of characters in time rather than as a jump-cut substitution melies the dwarf and the giant was released the same month and is more just a presentation of the trick which utilized a special dolly system and forced perspective perhaps scott lang was also in his magic interests a fan of melies films amzn_assoc_tracking_id filschrej-20 amzn_assoc_ad_mode manual amzn_assoc_ad_type smart

just recommend seven chances on my list of movies to watch after jurassic world fallen kingdom apparently it s a big inspiration on filmmakers right now because reed actually mentioned the buster keaton feature specifically as one of the big influences on a nt-man and the wasp from a new /film interview i think the ant-man movies are different than a lot of the other things in the mcu in that all the action sequences are really they come from a comedic place and buster keaton is a giant influence i went back and watched seven chances again which has to me the greatest chase scene of all time in a movie and also to me like one of the earliest examples of a ticking clock in a movie you know if you re not married by 7:00 pm on your 27th birthday you re gon na not get this 20 million dollars or whatever it was in the movie like that kind of thing was like okay that s what we re doing we if we can make a connection to the quantum realm and we can get janet s location great but there s a finite amount of time that we have to do it and it s good for the drama and it s good for the comedy amzn_assoc_tracking_id filschrej-20 amzn_assoc_ad_mode manual amzn_assoc_ad_type smart

early film employing shrinking and enlarging effects is the 1903 version of alice in wonderland which uses various effects to depict the title character s changes in size while not an example of live-action trickery disney s animated adaptation is also worth looking at in relation to ant-man and the wasp because it does the best job of portraying alice as sort of embarrassed and frustrated by her many awkward transformations much like scott feels when he s unable to control his new ant-man suit amzn_assoc_tracking_id filschrej-20 amzn_assoc_ad_mode manual amzn_assoc_ad_type smart

movie set in san francisco is complete without a chase sequence up and down the city s hilly streets you have to do that stunt where the cars jump into the air as they reach a peak and start to descend again every time it s a nod to the iconic chase of bullitt when done more comedically as in the case of ant-man and the wasp s sequence you also must recognize what s up doc peter bogdanovich s san francisco-set movie that parodies bullitt s sequence from a few years earlier the movie also like ant-man and the wasp involves a macguffin changing hands as it s pursued by multiple parties here s reed in the new /film interview on the influence of what s up doc of course bogdanovich s what s up doc was a big influence a movie i loved as a kid and we screened at marvel and it s like here s the ridiculous comedic car chase through san francisco and also the chemistry between streisand and ryan o neal in that movie and that was a big one amzn_assoc_tracking_id filschrej-20

amzn_assoc_linkid a765980591121a136886627c1c017b07 this martin scorsese movie is cited in many interviews as a direct influence on ant-man and the wasp reed told /film why after hours was a big one as far as what he looked at going into his ant-man sequel we liked the idea of a very specific timeline just over a couple of days scott lang has three days left of house arrest what could possibly go wrong yeah that was the you know really was just kind of like one crazy night idea and here s producer stephen broussard speaking on the set of ant-man and the wasp also via /film on how after hours as well as go and adventures in babysitting relates to the new superhero movie i don t really know if it s a genre unto itself but movies that have always been kind of one bad night when something just goes terrible and just kind of spirals out of control after hours is a great touchstone i like go go is a great movie you know adventures in babysitting for the lighter fare it just feels like it started so simple but then it kind of just goes up and up and up and then you have a character trying to race to put it all back in the box before they get caught. amzn_assoc_tracking_id filschrej-20

amzn_assoc_linkid 8ef6dbedbbcd677b4bc6f0ecbda9d575 going back to movies where characters change size this joe dante sci-fi comedy should be right up your alley if you enjoy the ant-man movies reed has cited fantastic voyage as one of his influences for the franchise that s another good movie to watch after these but innerspace which is also about a miniaturized ship navigating the microscopic map of a human body has the element of humor that makes it a more appropriate selection also similar to scott during the elementary school heist there are characters who shrink just slightly to child size maybe the next ant-man movie could see the superhero tasked with entering someone s insides amzn_assoc_tracking_id filschrej-20 amzn_assoc_ad_mode manual amzn_assoc_ad_type smart

seems like intentional trolling marvel beat dc by almost a year with its own nod to penny marshall s big shazam which arrives next april will come across as having a more direct and full link to the comedy that broke tom hanks out as a big movie star and an oscar-caliber one to boot but ant-man and the wasp certainly pays tribute during that sequence where scott is stuck in an awkward size while wearing a blue hoodie and having to navigate his daughter s school he s small rather than big but that adds to the gag amzn_assoc_tracking_id filschrej-20 amzn_assoc_ad_mode manual amzn_assoc_ad_type

this buddy comedy from martin brest has also been mentioned by reed as a source of inspiration he told fandango midnight run was a big influence just in terms of that movie is all forward motion and the lead characters have a very simple goal but that goal is constantly thwarted throughout the movie for various reasons in many interviews including this one at uproxx the director also pairs mention of midnight run with after hours because in both there s a very simple goal that needs to be accomplished and the journey getting there is nuts and all of these people come out of the woodwork with just midnight run though there s also a dynamic of characters similar to that of hank pym and scott lang in the ant-man movies as robert de niro plays a serious bounty hunter escorting a more comical common man type played by charles grodin amzn_assoc_tracking_id filschrej-20 amzn_assoc_ad_mode manual amzn_assoc_ad_type smart amzn_assoc_marketplace amazon amzn_assoc_region us

like to recommend the movie s where the actor actually looked as they magically appear in this scene ant-man and the wasp begins with a sequence from 1987 with youngified michael douglas and michelle pfeiffer for him that d be around the time of fatal attraction and wall street for her it s married to the mob dangerous liaisons and tequila sunrise the last of which would be the most fitting watch like ant-man its main character mel gibson is an ex-con trying to go straight and be with his kid but is pulled back in and must deal with a variety of foes also hey look it s young ego kurt russell from guardians of the galaxy vol 2 there s another flashback in ant-man and the wasp featuring a de-aged laurence fishburne partly played by his son langston but the year it takes place is not clear if we go by the age of the girl who plays young ava as it relates to the age of main ava/ghost actress hannah john-kamen we re looking at the sequence being set around 1996-1997 so maybe add event horizon to your suggested viewing list as well amzn_assoc_tracking_id filschrej-20 amzn_assoc_ad_mode manual amzn_assoc_ad_type smart amzn_assoc_marketplace amazon amzn_assoc_region us

aside from an excuse to give you another great appearance from dennis farina who is also in midnight run and a movie featuring thor s mom this is also another movie cited as an influence well maybe it was a reference to the book and really just elmore leonard s work overall but get shorty is the only one i ve seen sort of specifically named by the ant-man and the wasp team reed has acknowledged leonard in many interviews as an influence and has mentioned the idea of what if elmore leonard had written a science fiction novel and marvel made a movie of it meanwhile broussard said this more lengthy bit on the set of the movie i m a big elmore leonard fan in the way that there s all these sort of colorful characters kind of colliding with one another that feels crime-adjacent to use that term again and so we wanted to populate this movie with a lot of antagonists not so much people that are like villains or supervillains but like obstacles in the way they have their own agendas their own journeys they re not trying to take over the world but they re clearly standing in the way of our heroes and elmore leonard was such a master at that the get shortys of the world everybody is in a circle trying to get somewhere else and just colliding in the middle and that was a huge inspiration for the tone and the framework of where this movie could go amzn_assoc_tracking_id filschrej-20

amzn_assoc_linkid b86710cbb658ddfef7f2f29b62cc2bee one scene in ant-man and the wasp appears to be a direct nod to this debut feature of screenwriter charlie kaufman directed by spike jonze scott dozes off in the bathtub and in what seems like a dream his consciousness is transported into the mind of janet van dyne he suddenly sees through her eyes only realizing what s going on when he glimpses into the mirror and sees de-aged michelle pfeiffer instead of paul rudd later janet takes over scott s body puppeteer-like in a scene with hank and hope while there are other two-way body-swapping movies that could be recognized instead or maybe the 1984 comedy all of me in which lili tomlin star of her own shrinking person movie a few years earlier takes over part of the body of steve martin but i think being john malkovich is the only movie that fits that also shows us the character pov in the very same way as is done in ant-man and the wasp now if only we could see janet go inside her own head for a surreal sequence where everyone is michelle pfeiffer and all their dialogue is vandyne van dyne vandyne we all wanted to see more pfeiffer anyway amzn_assoc_tracking_id

unofficially tested for nasa s initial astronaut program thirteen women went through the training hence their eponymous label akin to the mercury seven group of men that was admitted into project mercury they were also known as the first lady astronaut trainees or flats the documentary chronicles a history that follows through to sally ride unrelated to the flat group becoming the actual first woman in space as well as other female astronauts that have come since recommending mercury 13 is not just about the relevance of women qualified or even more appropriate for a role that men have dominated though hope as the wasp definitely shows that anything a male counterpart can do she can do better it s also not because the flats are acknowledged in a 2012 captain marvel comic book and therefore could be also recognized in the next marvel movie i mainly find it interesting that the mercury 13 women were an evolution from a little-known group formed during world war ii called wasp an acronym for women airline service pilots making hope s superhero moniker even more significant as a slight maybe even unintentional nod to those real heroes watch it on netflix netflix 11m subscribers
