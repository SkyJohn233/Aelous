Is there a way to download them so I can play them offline? Hello, there was a similar question the other day: //www.makeuseof.com/answers/run-downloaded-flash-games-flash-player/ the simple solution is to save the swf file,and play on flash player. how to save swf :  once the game is loaded, save complete webpage from file menu. then you can find the swf file from the saved files. 2nd easy option : set your download manager to download swf files. if you can;t find flash paltyer on your pc, use this one : http://www.mediafire.com/?2ytwkny1nmt#1 but...many sites do not give you complete swf, and when you play the, it  does not play properly.it can be because of some of the components or actions are accessd from the server and are not loaded directly on your broswer. when i tested it from the site you mentioned, the same thing happened. the game loaded, but not in a playable form. i could not play it, you can try it , may be it was because of the version of flash player at my end, and you can play it properly.
