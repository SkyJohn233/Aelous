i x27 m wasting my youth introvert 23 m a year after graduating i x27 m starting to realize how many amazing people i missed out on in college i haven x27 t made a friend since junior high i live with my parents now and have an ok job except night shift part but i x27 m really starting to feel intense shame for not having a single friend i don x27 t even want to visit extended family anymore because i don x27 t really do anything or know anyone at all and i x27 m ashamed to tell them that i x27 m starting to get tired of life it x27 s scary parents got me a therapist and she x27 s nice but idk what to do anymore i guess i x27 m not really an introvert but maybe i am sorry if i x27 m rambling i think i x27 ll be okay eventually just not sure how couple nights ago i had a dream about this cute resident mentor a few floors up in my freshman dorm in the dream we just talked but i felt really lonely when i woke up you x27 re lucky to realize this now i didn x27 t realize what i x27 d missed out on until i was nearly 30 i was bullied in school and it left me with the feeling that people were only including me because they felt like they had to it took me a long time to learn to interact with people i still have a hard time finding the meaningful relationships with people that i desire but i am at least trying even if it means having grin and bear small talk while i try to discover if the person i x27 m talking to is actually i interesting i am in the exact same situation i x27 m not sure why either i can get along with people and even make them laugh but at the end of the day i may have just been protecting myself i just can x27 t get close to people or i am afraid how much of a sham they will think of me i study engineering and i literally feel shit telling people what degree i m doing not that it is stupid it just yields the same response of you must be smart even though in reality i am average at best plus the main thing is i am just terrible at maintaining relationships plenty of times i would be invited out or have a set plan but only for it to fall through eventually i just stopped trying so now same place as you are i do envy those with a group of friends to uphold them on their worst days but why can x27 t i have that too your post struck a chord i am much older than 23 but what you wrote resonates well with how i felt at that age my 20s were a kind of wasteland and not much memorable happened like you wrote i felt my life slipping by very quickly and my youth was being wasted i had one or two friends was socially invisible family members told me i was acting like an old man i didn x27 t even recognize much less deal with my own introversion and shyness until i was well into my 50s between my 20s and 50s life was a confusing battle but i did engage the struggle and overcame some obstacles i assumed i was just like everyone else and everyone else was just like me except there was this unexplained gulf between what other people were capable of and the limited set of things i could do socially there are many paths to being introverted and/or shy but i x27 d put this idea out there it may have something to do with family dynamics and your remaining in the same family situation as a grown adult could block the change you need for what it x27 s worth here x27 s what i did after years of internal struggle and living at home with parents and the same old high school friends i made a clean break and went to school in a far-off city i was forced to make new friends and make a fresh start the amazing thing was that within a short time a group of other youngish people reached out to me and invited me into their social group without judgement looking back now i realize they must have recognized my kind of personality and dealt with it and just accepted me it was an amazing time and a time of great change and growth it wasn x27 t that my introverted and shy nature suddenly evapourated it was that it didn x27 t matter to my circle of friends and i modelled my life on their more outwardly oriented style they accepted me for what i was and we moved on from there through our academic studies much later in life i finally recognized and accepted myself and now a lot of mysteries make perfect sense it would have been interesting to have this insight at age 23 but it wasn x27 t meant to be i understand how you feel i have few friends fewer very close friends i x27 m two decades older than you- so feel i can give some advice that might help might not i am a very private person and don x27 t do much socially and it drains me i was almost where you are don x27 t fault yourself for being solitary take your time find a hobby that you really like that x27 s one way to at least get out and meet some folks oh and from experience i too regret staying silent and not meeting and talking to the people in college say hello give a compliment interaction complete it may seem like nothing but you will be remembered and it may lead to more i x27 m 31 and i remember feeling the same in my 20s i forced myself to be active to go out etc many times now i realize that was the reason i felt into being alcohol addict those times i regret that i didn x27 t just let me be myself from the other hand recently after some panic attacks i realised that life is just a chance to do something at leat have a fun of it so generally don x27 t be afraid to do what you like most importantly don x27 t stress yourself that you are not living perfect cause such thing does not exists so many people starving you are lucky being a westerner what do you want whatever it may be friends a significant other a better job a healthier body etc don x27 t let any one stop you from getting it even yourself introverts tend to get into their own way more often than anything else post-college life is very unstructured more so than ever before it is up to you to make things happen i x27 ve written out a good life plan but i don x27 t stick to it i x27 m not very disciplined i x27 m 31 and i remember feeling the same in my 20s i forced myself to be active to go out etc many times now i realize that was the reason i felt into being alcohol addict those times i regret that i didn x27 t just let me be myself from the other hand recently after some panic attacks i realised that life is just a chance to do something at leat have a fun of it so generally don x27 t be afraid to do what you like most importantly don x27 t stress yourself that you are not living perfect cause such thing does not exists so many people starving you are lucky being a westerner you sound like a socially anxious extravert not an introvert introversion isn x27 t being afraid to talk to people and introverts are more contented with less social interaction provided the interactions themselves are more intimate you sound like a person who has little going on in their life and so latches on to other people providing that missing value for them connecting with people isn x27 t particularly hard provided you acquire interest skills and hobbies that lend towards interacting with people i x27 d advise you stop beating around the bush and wallowing in your own self created problem pick up some interest pick up some hobbies connect with others this just seems like some friendly opinions i want my money back maybe look around and see if there are any clubs relating to any of your interests near you i definitely relate to how you x27 re feeling i like to make music and write songs so i recently went to an open mic night and i talked briefly with some cool people there it helped me realize that there are people out there who i can relate to everyone has regrets you can x27 t let that rule your life getting yourself out there will be uncomfortable but it x27 s necessary for you to change those amazing people you x27 missed out on x27 in college are still out there and there are probably more out there than you think there are even introverts need friends edit maybe x27 want x27 is a better word than x27 need x27 i don x27 t know i don x27 t think people you didn x27 t even manage to connect with would have made good friends or offered you whatever experience you x27 re looking for you can put yourself out there and meet people through various means but if stuff doesn x27 t happen naturally and you have to try ridiculously hard to mantain a relationship with them it defeats the purpose you probably didn x27 t miss out on anything i never get past the acquaintance phase with anyone and i don x27 t really know why i can x27 t say i took advantage of all the social opportunities in college very well at all i x27 m in the same situation but i x27 m 24 and haven x27 t finished college because i x27 m so indecisive and have no friends my fear of speaking in public also doesn x27 t help i hope that some things change i kind of became a introvert and i daydream about having someone to talk to it sounds like you x27 re depressed or are getting depressed in terms of feeling tired of life and it sounds a bit like you may suffer from anhedonia loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities you haven x27 t said it straight out but i get that sense from your post tell me if i x27 m totally off you certainly could also be introverted i have a hard time driving relationships and it sounds like a lot of introverts have a similar problem basically you let the other person decide how to go from acquaintances to friends the best solution is taking risks and making yourself vulnerable and inviting people to do things and not taking it personally when they say no just like with dating keep trying keep putting yourself out there it x27 s exhausting and hard and your ability to do it will probably fluctuate but i think that x27 s the only solution i x27 m working on that one myself still everyone has to try with relationships no matter what kind by not trying your basically just putting the onus on the other person to keep the relationship going and they x27 re going to get real tired of that real quick saying if they x27 re not easy then they x27 re not worth it is a total cop-out i still enjoy stuff i used to like i x27 m just tired of watching life go by and it not being how i want it as for introversion my understanding of it is that it entails losing energy from social activities i feel more energized talking to people especially those i find interesting i should try more i x27 m just kinda lazy i guess working on it though for some of us it takes a lot of effort but if you put in the effort now you may have those friends for a long time i x27 m in mid life and wish i had forced myself to put in more effort along the way i am awkwardish need a lot of quiet time and always feel like i am putting people out i realize that some people have natural instincts and habits that allow them to not only make friends easier but maintain and grow those friendships easier at the early stages can you make work friends at your age that was a good source of casual friends for me if you can find a day or swing shift job it would probably make that easier as well as improve your mental health night shift work is really really bad for you www.7cups.com is the place where you must go do you have any hobbies that you are really into also if you live in a large city you might want to see if there are any local introverted group that organize get together that is a starting step i x27 d recommend thinking about something that you have always wanted to learn how to do and then go do it it is hard but it x27 s worth it to get out and meet people i x27 m sorry you had to deal with a toxic relationship like that hope it works out for you you should stop masturbating it might help and do pushups every day many of the healthy and confident introverts are being driven out of this sub because it x27 s getting overrun by people that think social anxiety is introversion i don x27 t get annoyed by constant messages and i don x27 t have to argue why i don x27 t like to hang out i leave a straight reply and that x27 s it my anxiety decreased since i did that and if i wan na read messages without anyone noticing i just use airplane mode i often told my friends and people around me i need a lot of time for myself usually i explain myself because i feel like it x27 s necessary but i feel like this comes from me not appreciating the stuff i do in my free time people always tell me to be more organized and fulfill my duties so unfortunately i ain x27 t got time 👀 when i was fit and had sharp facial features they would tell me on the first date that they thought i was arrogant but were attracted to me because of that now that i x27 m obese they think i x27 m a creep and some even point and laugh at me it saddens me knowing how my life was in comparison to now but i x27 m still happy regardless it just sucks that people judge you differently as an introvert simply because of how your body looks sigh oh well off to watch some more anime and drink some hot chocolate i feel so lonely i work with all these people and i try to be nice and funny and helpful i know i am an introvert i m not super outgoing or talkative but i try but i feel like i can t make a connection with anyone everyone i work with has worked all together before and they all seem like such good friends i try but i feel like they are only nice to me because i have to work with them i don t get invited to outside things and when outside plans happen they whisper around me i just feel unwanted by everyone i ve never posted anything here before but i just feel like i had to get it out maybe i am just whining or maybe i am just overthinking everything i don t know so i ve been a introvert since the beginning of my teen years and i get really clingy with people with i really like when its ether romantic or platonic i was just wondering if any other introverted people have experienced this 167k members 192 online aug 27 2008 cake day
