need to enable directplay very easy just open search for control panel click programs and features and on the left you will see turn windows features on or off click that and it will bring up a small box find legacy components and click it you will now see direct play tick the box and then wait while it gets enabled.this will prevent the directx 8.1 pop-up you can disable it after if you wish but the game will only be playable with directplay enabled feel free to youtube search this if you are still unsure.this game can not use a controller without a 3rd party program to let a controller emulate a mouse and keyboard you can find that through a quick google.other then that its a very fun action horror game with heavy themes fast moving monsters based read more kingbradley7 games

and screenshots may suggest to you the suffering is more of an action game than actual horror there are no jumpscares and the psychological approach is far from the level achieved by games such as f.e.a.r. for example none the less the atmosphere is nicely implemented and the game itself provides a few interesting mechanics to keep itself interesting avoiding the bane of many action games repetitiveness.the story is relatively simple you re torque a convict of death row for murdering his wife and children you couldn t even properly defend yourself as during the time of killing you had a black out as you enter your cell an earthquake errupts and soon your inmates are attacked by strange creatures using read more cornbredx games reviews 12 titles are for suckers september 7 2017 verified owner man i played this game several times over the last 15 years or whatever it s been i originally had it for the original xbox but my original xbox died a long time ago so all my xbox games just sit in a binder in my closet forever at some point this game became some kind of weird thing that no one cared about and they decided to just give it away online so everyone was downloading it for free not long after that wb said uh no we want ya ll to pay for that and the game was no longer free to be clear wb was giving it away for free and then changed their mind- the business behind what happened there was always unclear .then a few years ago i bought this and the sequel on ebay for the pc because why not i really wanted to play this again and i never played the follow up.this

things go to hell opening since half life the action was great the atmosphere was creepy the blade arm guys dragging their knives across the ground the game also never had any dull parts adrenaline that still managed to be creepy all the way through it was up there with fatal frame silent hill 2 and obscure for my favorite ps2 horror games what it lacked in pure atmospheric horror it made up for with action.deducting a star though because it s only age read more not like it changes anything but we are obligated to inform you that we are using cookies well we just did more info on cookies your
