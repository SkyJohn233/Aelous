Electoral Systems in Germany by Michael Montana on Prezi Trending searches Up next Conservation Circle Information Prezi Team Updated 17 October 2012 As a result, in 2011, Angela Merkel ' s government eliminated the negative vote weight. Additionally, it created a new class of augmentation seats, whereby any wasted votes in a state for parties crossing the threshold would be provided bonus seats. This proposal was again rejected by the German constitutional court due to the fact that continued to allow significant benefits to parties gaining overhand seats. As a result, Germany is currently technically without an electoral law. Each German cast two votes, namely a first vote for a constituency candidate, and a second vote for a party list. Part lists are closed, so electors mart not choose individual candidates in or alter the order of such lists. Of the two votes, the second vote is the most important, since it is the one that determines the composition of the Bundestag CONS In july 2008, the Constitutional Court decided that the allocation system used to allocate seats under the MMP system was unconstitutional as it occasionally resulted in negative vote weights for voters in states where their party had already achieved an overhang.
