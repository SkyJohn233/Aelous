Muscle quantity is not synonymous with muscle quality. Barbat-Artigas S(1), Rolland Y, Vellas B, Aubertin-Leheudre M. >< Author information:  >(1)Département de Biologie, Université du Québec à Montréal, Montréal, Canada; Groupe de Recherche en Activité Physique Adaptée, Université du Québec à Montréal, Montréal, Canada; Centre de Recherche de l'Institut Universitaire de Gériatrie de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.< p> >< BACKGROUND: Greater muscle mass can generally produce greater muscle strength.However, whether higher muscle mass is associated with higher muscle quality(muscle strength relative to muscle mass) remains unknown. Furthermore, thenature of this relationship, and how their interaction determines the presence offunctional impairments are unknown. This article aims to address these issues.METHODS: Secondary data analysis including 1219 women aged 75 years and older of the Toulouse ÉPIDemiologie de l'OSteoporose cohort study. Body composition (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), handgrip, and knee extension strength wereassessed. Physical function was measured using the chair stand test as well asthe usual and fast gait speed tests. Participants were also asked if theyexperienced any difficulty in performing functional tasks.RESULTS: Upper- and lower-body muscle quality (r = -0.42, P  <  .001 and r = -0.16,P  <  .001, respectively) were significantly and negatively correlated withappendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI). Independently of ASMI,individuals with high muscle quality had low risks of functional impairments(odds ratio  < 0.74), whereas individuals with high ASMI but low muscle quality hadhigh risks of impairments (odds ratio  > 1.27).CONCLUSIONS: This inverse relationship between muscle mass and quality impliesthat sarcopenic individuals have better muscle quality than nonsarcopenicindividuals. Results also suggest that high muscle quality may compensate for lowASMI with respect to functional impairments. Physical activity may potentially beinvolved in this relationship.Copyright © 2013 American Medical Directors Association, Inc. Published byElsevier Inc. All rights reserved. ><
