pareto principle wikipedia the pareto principle also known as the 80/20 rule the law of the vital few or the principle of factor sparsity 1 2 states that for many events roughly 80 of the effects come from 20 of the causes 3 management consultant joseph m. juran suggested the principle and named it after italian economist vilfredo pareto who noted the 80/20 connection while at the university of lausanne in 1896 as published in his first work cours d'économie politique in it pareto showed that approximately 80 of the land in italy was owned by 20 of the population it is an axiom of business management that 80 of sales come from 20 of clients 4 mathematically the 80/20 rule is roughly followed by a power law distribution also known as a pareto distribution for a particular set of parameters and many natural phenomena have been shown empirically to exhibit such a distribution 5 the pareto principle is only tangentially related to pareto efficiency pareto developed both concepts in the context of the distribution of income and wealth among the population the original observation was in connection with population and wealth pareto noticed that approximately 80 of italy 's land was owned by 20 of the population 6 he then carried out surveys on a variety of other countries and found to his surprise that a similar distribution applied a chart that gave the inequality a very visible and comprehensible form the so-called champagne glass effect 7 was contained in the 1992 united nations development program report which showed that distribution of global income is very uneven with the richest 20 of the world 's population controlling 82.7 of the world 's income 8 still the gini index of the world shows that nations have starkly varying wealth distributions the pareto principle also could be seen as applying to taxation in the us the top 20 of earners have paid roughly 80-90 of federal income taxes in 2000 and 2006 10 and again in 2018 11 however it is important to note that while there have been associations of such with meritocracy the principle should not be confused with farther reaching implications as alessandro pluchino at the university of catania in italy points out other attributes do not necessarily correlate using talent as an example he and other researchers state the maximum success never coincides with the maximum talent and vice-versa. and that such factors are the result of chance 12 in computer science the pareto principle can be applied to optimization efforts 13 for example microsoft noted that by fixing the top 20 of the most-reported bugs 80 of the related errors and crashes in a given system would be eliminated 14 lowell arthur expressed that 20 percent of the code has 80 percent of the errors find them fix them 15 it was also discovered that in general the 80 of a certain piece of software can be written in 20 of the total allocated time conversely the hardest 20 of the code takes 80 of the time this factor is usually a part of cocomo estimating for software coding it has been inferred the pareto principle applies to athletic training where roughly 20 of the exercises and habits have 80 of the impact and the trainee should not focus so much on a varied training 16 this does not necessarily mean that having a healthy diet or going to the gym are not important but they are not as significant as the key activities it is also important to note this 80/20 rule has yet to be scientifically tested in controlled studies with regards to athletic training in baseball the pareto principle has been perceived in wins above replacement an attempt to combine multiple statistics to determine a player 's overall importance to a team 15 of all the players last year produced 85 of the total wins with the other 85 of the players creating 15 of the wins the pareto principle holds up pretty soundly when it is applied to baseball 17 occupational health and safety professionals use the pareto principle to underline the importance of hazard prioritization assuming 20 of the hazards account for 80 of the injuries and by categorizing hazards safety professionals can target those 20 of the hazards that cause 80 of the injuries or accidents alternatively if hazards are addressed in random order a safety professional is more likely to fix one of the 80 of hazards that account only for some fraction of the remaining 20 of injuries 18 aside from ensuring efficient accident prevention practices the pareto principle also ensures hazards are addressed in an economical order as the technique ensures the resources used are best used to prevent the most accidents 19 in engineering control theory such as for electromechanical energy converters the 80/20 principle applies to optimization efforts 13 the law of the few can be also seen in betting where it is said that with 20 effort you can match the accuracy of 80 of the bettors 20 in the systems science discipline joshua m. epstein and robert axtell created an agent-based simulation model called sugarscape from a decentralized modeling approach based on individual behavior rules defined for each agent in the economy wealth distribution and pareto 's 80/20 principle became emergent in their results which suggests the principle is a collective consequence of these individual rules 21 the pareto principle has many applications in quality control 22 it is the basis for the pareto chart one of the key tools used in total quality control and six sigma techniques the pareto principle serves as a baseline for abc-analysis and xyz-analysis widely used in logistics and procurement for the purpose of optimizing stock of goods as well as costs of keeping and replenishing that stock 23 in health care in the united states in one instance 20 of patients have been found to use 80 of health care resources 24 25 26 some cases of super-spreading conform to the 20/80 rule 27 where approximately 20 of infected individuals are responsible for 80 of transmissions although super-spreading can still be said to occur when super-spreaders account for a higher or lower percentage of transmissions 28 in epidemics with super-spreading the majority of individuals infect relatively few secondary contacts the dunedin study has found 80 of crimes are committed by 20 of criminals 29 this statistic has been used to support both stop-and-frisk policies and broken windows policing as catching those criminals committing minor crimes will supposedly net many criminals wanted for or who would normally commit larger ones many video rental shops reported in 1988 that 80 of revenue came from 20 of videotapes a video-chain executive discussed the gone with the wind syndrome however in which every store had to offer classics like gone with the wind casablanca or the african queen to appear to have a large inventory even if customers very rarely rented them 30 the idea has a rule of thumb application in many places but it is commonly misused for example it is a misuse to state a solution to a problem fits the 80/20 rule just because it fits 80 of the cases it must also be that the solution requires only 20 of the resources that would be needed to solve all cases additionally it is a misuse of the 80/20 rule to interpret a small number of categories or observations this is a special case of the wider phenomenon of pareto distributions if the pareto index α which is one of the parameters characterizing a pareto distribution is chosen as α log 4 5 ≈ 1.16 then one has 80 of effects coming from 20 of causes it follows that one also has 80 of that top 80 of effects coming from 20 of that top 20 of causes and so on eighty percent of 80 is 64 20 of 20 is 4 so this implies a 64/4 law and similarly implies a 51.2/0.8 law similarly for the bottom 80 of causes and bottom 20 of effects the bottom 80 of the bottom 80 only cause 20 of the remaining 20 this is broadly in line with the world population/wealth table above where the bottom 60 of the people own 5.5 of the wealth approximating to a 64/4 connection the 64/4 correlation also implies a 32 'fair area between the 4 and 64 where the lower 80 of the top 20 16 and upper 20 of the bottom 80 also 16 relates to the corresponding lower top and upper bottom of effects 32 this is also broadly in line with the world population table above where the second 20 control 12 of the wealth and the bottom of the top 20 presumably control 16 of the wealth the term 80/20 is only a shorthand for the general principle at work in individual cases the distribution could just as well be say nearer to 90/10 or 70/30 there is no need for the two numbers to add up to the number 100 as they are measures of different things e.g. 'number of customers vs 'amount spent however each case in which they do not add up to 100 is equivalent to one in which they do for example as noted above the 64/4 law in which the two numbers do not add up to 100 is equivalent to the 80/20 law in which they do add up to 100 thus specifying two percentages independently does not lead to a broader class of distributions than what one gets by specifying the larger one and letting the smaller one be its complement relative to 100 thus there is only one degree of freedom in the choice of that parameter adding up to 100 leads to a nice symmetry for example if 80 of effects come from the top 20 of sources then the remaining 20 of effects come from the lower 80 of sources this is called the joint ratio and can be used to measure the degree of imbalance a joint ratio of 96:4 is very imbalanced 80:20 is significantly imbalanced gini index 76 70:30 is moderately imbalanced gini index 28 and 55:45 is just slightly imbalanced gini index 14 the pareto principle is an illustration of a power law relationship which also occurs in phenomena such as brush fires and earthquakes 31 because it is self-similar over a wide range of magnitudes it produces outcomes completely different from normal or gaussian distribution phenomena this fact explains the frequent breakdowns of sophisticated financial instruments which are modeled on the assumption that a gaussian relationship is appropriate to for example stock price movements 32 using the a b notation for example 0.8:0.2 and with a b 1 inequality measures like the gini index g and the hoover index h can be computed in this case both are the same paretorule.cf the pareto rule
