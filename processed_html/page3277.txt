THE DARKER THE SHADE OF LATERITE, THE HARDER, HEAVIER AND MORE RESISTANT TO WATER IT IS.  SOME LATERITES HAVE A PUZZOLONIC REACTION WHEN MIXED WITH LIME PRODUCING HARD AND DURABLE BUIDING MATERIAL.  they can be used as a good building material (varghese and byju.1993). LATERITE STONE OCCURANCE  The first global synthesis of the distribution of laterite prepared by Prescott and Pendleton in 1952 (Pearson, 1970).  the tropics and subtropics of Africa, Australia, India, South-East Asia, and South America.  In india, laterite is found in western ghat region, mainly goa, kerela, coastal region of maharshtra, tamil nadu, parts of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, west Bengal, arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and mizorum.  Kerala is known as type locality of laterite; prolonged rainfall, intermittent dry seasons and sloping terrain are conducive to laterite formation (Narayanaswamy, 2001). More than 60% of the state is covered by laterite blanket over various crystalline rocks that occupy the midland region of the state, as shown in the geological map of Kerala LATERITE STONE LATERITE STONE LATERITE STONE LATERITE STONE Extraction INDURATION PROCESS Manufacturing into different sizes back TO MOTHER EARTH Road construction Disintegration into the soil Building construction Dismantling the building LATERITE STONE Advantages  Helps in reducing the Carbon Dioxide emissions.  Abundantly available around the world in tropical belt.  Optimum Thermal mass and thermal insulation properties .  walls allow the storage of solar heat during the day and its slow release during the night, thus contributing to indoor comfort and reducing electricity consumption.  regulate the humidity of indoor air due to their permeability to water vapour.  No greenhouse gas emission as the blocks are made cast in situ. disadvantages  a weak stone, but can be used for masonry constructions.  When using for framed structure, the size of the stone can be reduced which in turn Reduces the strength of the stone.  Hence a life cycle cost analysis is mandatory in case of laterite.  The concept of having a cheap material like laterite gives a cheap look is what is hampering the usage of laterite stone. CONCLUSION: The appearance of such houses give a rustic low profile and close to nature look which is why it has been used since the making of Angkor Wat and natural materials are sustainable than the conventional ones.
