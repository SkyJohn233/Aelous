state dogs the surprisingly tortuous kid-defying history of dog-honoring legislation slate logo slate logo photograph by ronald m√ºller-hagen it is impossible to have a rational let alone civil discussion in american politics today forget the debt ceiling debate and the furor over obamacare consider kansas house bill 2513 rep. ed trimmer s proposal to make the cairn terrier that being the wiry tan breed that played toto in the wizard of oz the sunflower state s official dog this seemingly uncontroversial measure was vigorously derided on the internet and drew the ire of people for the ethical treatment of animals which pretty much doomed the bill before it had a chance to build momentum if passed hb 2513 would worsen one of kansas serious problems its reputation as a hotbed for cruel filthy puppy mills wrote martin mersereau director of peta s cruelty investigations department this is a dissent based on what i call the 101 dalmatians principle and it s a fairly common position taken by both peta and its apparent enemies the official clubs that lord over specific breeds promoting healthy and responsible reproduction it comes up every time a new breed wins at westminster the president of the united states picks a pooch or a hit film or tv show makes a breed famous i have little doubt that the jack russell people are wary of the artist but trimmer did not abandon the bill in fear of his reputation we had great responses from kids the state representative told the wichita eagle and he vowed to raise the matter again after rallying his youngest constituents this will give me a chance to go into the classrooms and visit with them he told the paper to let them know that sometimes when you ask the first time and the answer is no you have to learn how to ask again the representative is on to something there the pleas of children both answered and unanswered provide the through line in america s long surprisingly tortuous history of canine-honoring legislation two years ago for example alaska gov sean parnell signed a bill declaring the alaskan malamute the official state dog in front of more than 400 grade-school students and their parents the malamute s exalted status came after three years of lobbying on behalf of polaris elementary student paige hill who first mentioned the idea to her kindergarten teacher in 2007 the school rallied behind the concept bringing the matter to the attention of state reps it was n't easy but it was fun hill a third-grader by the time the bill was approved told the anchorage daily news i am glad the malamute is the state dog and my grandma shirley is very proud of me maryland chesapeake bay retriever selecting a state dog can be delicate business as america s 11 pooch-honoring states have discovered one must take into account history canine temperament political expediency and the entreaties of small children by comparison to later selections the united states first official state dog was an obvious uncontroversial choice maryland designated the chesapeake bay retriever its official pooch on account of the breed s dramatic origins the tale sounds like something out of twelfth night two young dogs one male and one female survived a shipwreck near the coast of maryland they were bred with local coonhounds to produce a new line of waterfowl hunters famous chesapeake bay retriever sailor boy theodore roosevelt s dog pennsylvania great dane the great dane breed seemingly goes back as far as ancient egypt where dane-like drawings grace monuments dating to 3,000 b.c in modern times a great dane named giant george has been feted as the world s largest dog standing about 3-and-a-half feet tall among the giant breed s other honors it was named the keystone state s official dog in 1965 famous great dane scooby-doo virginia american foxhound though flesh-and-blood american foxhounds are relatively rare today you can find them in oil paintings adorning golf clubs taverns and posh living rooms all along the east coast think of the american foxhound as the english foxhound 2.0 with a virginian twist they were supposedly bred at mount vernon by george washington himself massachusetts boston terrier the boston terrier known as the american gentleman made history as the country s first recognized nonsporting breed massachusetts has long adored him gov michael dukakis even declared a boston terrier week in 1975 strangely enough the massachusetts legislature originally rejected a fifth-grade classroom s pleas to institute the terrier as state pooch in 1978 he eventually got the laurels he deserved a year later famous boston terrier rhett the boston university mascot louisiana catahoula leopard dog designated louisiana s official hound in 1979 the catahoula leopard dog is the only surviving dog to have been bred by native americans a partial list of his supposed ancestors includes the mexican xoloitzcuintli the peruvian inca orchid the american dingo and the red wolf south carolina boykin spaniel legend has it that a small brown stray followed a south carolina banker home one evening in the early 1900s the banker gave the dog to his friend and hunting companion whit boykin who trained it to flush and retrieve fowl almost a century later in 1985 the fully established boykin spaniel became south carolina s state dog wisconsin american water spaniel born and bred in wisconsin the american water spaniel is exceedingly friendly it also has webbed toes so why did the wisconsin senate oppose the spaniel s selection as state dog so vigorously the push to exalt the american water spaniel came from a class project to learn how government works leaving one senator to note we shouldn t pass bills because a high-school class wants it luckily for the water spaniel the kids prevailed in 1985 correction this slide originally and incorrectly displayed a photo of an english springer spaniel north carolina plott hound when johannes plott first came to north carolina in 1750 he brought with him some brindle-coated boar hounds from the mountains of germany henry plott his son made the spotted dogs famous breeding them for their distinctive baying sound according to the american kennel club plott music is distinguished by a loud ringing chop on the track and the tree although bawl or squall trailing mouths are also acceptable the plott hound claimed state dog status in 1989 texas blue lacy in 2005 rick perry signed a bill declaring the blue lacy texas official state dog the legislation reads whereas the blue lacy is a texas native a working dog bred to play an essential role in ranch operations at a time when ranches themselves became one of the iconic texas symbols and a dog that has more than pulled its weight on many a texas spread this proud heritage assuredly gives the lacy a unique and powerful claim of its own to represent the lone star state the breed is not actually blue or lacy but gray red or a combination of the two new hampshire chinook in 2009 seventh-graders from the ross a. lurgio middle school in bedford n.h. successfully took up the cause of the chinook a sled dog originally reared to accompany explorers to the north pole famous chinook arthur walden s lead sled dog which was unimaginatively named chinook alaska alaskan malamute in alaska a kindergartener named paige hill was the driving force behind the malamute getting recognized as a state symbol in 2010 don t mistake this sturdy dog for its lither cousin the siberian husky malamutes are the freight truckers of dogdom bred to drag heavy sleds through subzero climes famous alaskan malamute balto maryland chesapeake bay retriever selecting a state dog can be delicate business as america s 11 pooch-honoring states have discovered one must take into account history canine temperament political expediency and the entreaties of small children by comparison to later selections the united states first official state dog was an obvious uncontroversial choice maryland designated the chesapeake bay retriever its official pooch on account of the breed s dramatic origins the tale sounds like something out of twelfth night two young dogs one male and one female survived a shipwreck near the coast of maryland they were bred with local coonhounds to produce a new line of waterfowl hunters famous chesapeake bay retriever sailor boy theodore roosevelt s dog a few years earlier it was a group of bedford n.h. seventh-graders who brought a prick-eared frizzy-coated breed known as the chinook to the attention of that state s legislature the kids who helped their cause by hauling a winsome chinook named abby to the state senate hearing won passage of a bill venerating that sled and work dog the only breed to have originated in new hampshire and one of the few created in america small children aren t always needed to get a state legislature to honor man s best friend pennsylvania one of the first to consider the matter of an official state dog took up the cause of the great dane selected because several of the behemoth dogs appear in a famous painting alongside ben franklin with admirable verve when the speaker of the house called for a voice vote yips growls and barks assaulted his ears from every part of the chamber rep. sam rohrer supposedly noted with a rap of his gavel the speaker confirmed that the arfs have it the pennsylvania bill a classic example of midcentury dog-honoring reads in part whereas the great dane represents both the great hunting and industrial parts of pennsylvania having begun as a hunting breed just as pennsylvania began as a hunting commonwealth later also becoming a leading working breed just as pennsylvania became a leading working commonwealth and whereas the outline of the great dane 's head resembles the outline of the commonwealth 's boundaries and whereas the great dane is known as the king of his species just as pennsylvania 's state bird is known as the king of its species and whereas the physical and other attributes of the great dane to wit size strength beauty intelligence tolerance courage faithfulness trustworthiness and stability exemplify those of pennsylvania and whereas naming an official dog of the commonwealth would recognize the steadfast service and loyal devotion of all dogs in pennsylvania and provide a symbol of the great home side of pennsylvania maryland and virginia which chose the chesapeake bay retriever and the american foxhound in 1964 and 1966 respectively also seem to have picked their official dogs with little controversy so did north carolina and texas whose dog bills gained passage thanks to the usual political recipe weird amendments and favors to rich people north carolina s 1989 law making the plott hound the state pooch included a passage that made dog theft a felony offense it also stated that the taking of a dog for temporary purposes is a misdemeanor making north carolina the only state to criminalize unauthorized dog borrowing and in 2005 texas influential and wealthy lacy family which provided much of the granite for the state capitol lobbied on behalf of the blue lacy hunting dog a breed they themselves had developed for hunting whereas the blue lacy is a texas native a working dog bred to play an essential role in ranch operations at a time when ranches themselves became one of the iconic texas symbols and a dog that has more than pulled its weight on many a texas spread the bill read and gov rick perry signed it into law but in the history of american canine lawmaking those states have been the easygoing kidless exceptions consider massachusetts where the eventual selection of the boston terrier nicknamed the american gentleman hardly seems controversial or at least seems less controversial than the state s official muffin yes massachusetts has a state muffin and it is corn consider that the boston terrier was developed in the city for which it is named and it never lacked influential fans gov michael dukakis proclaimed a boston terrier week in 1975 and tip o neill managed to get the u.s. congress to name it the official dog of the bicentennial and yet when a group of fifth-graders from marlborough first attempted to get the dog s status made official in 1978 they were shot down by the state senate the boston terrier was granted official status only when a year later a woman named irene ryan took it upon herself to write state pols hundreds of letters on the terrier s behalf this wasn t the only time the kid lobby was quashed in 1985 the same year south carolina honored the boykin spaniel a compact curly-eared water dog bred to work on boats in the state s riverine swaps the dog politicking got ugly in wisconsin it all started when lyle brumm decided to teach his eighth-graders about how state government works according to a story in akc family dog magazine brumm s students lobbied the legislature to select the american water spaniel making 11 separate trips to the capitol until a bill was drafted and passed by the state assembly in 1983 that was just phase one a year later the bill was put before the senate committee on urban affairs and government operations where senators didn t just oppose the measure they trashed it according to a new york times report one lawmaker interrupted the children 's testimony with howling and barking sen. mordecai lee declared that sending the bill to the senate floor would be opening a can of worms on such measures in fact i believe the worm will be the next state symbol he concluded by going full scrooge we shouldn t pass bills because a high-school class wants it even worse was the reaction of sen. dan theno who called the american water spaniel a dog bred in wisconsin a flea-bitten mangy mutt that has the propensity to be ornery adding that it had a tail like a rat as you might expect the politicians mockery of a motivated bunch of kids didn t go over well gov anthony earl vowed to rectify the situation and made good after escorting a second bill through the senate he signed it into law in front of 1,000 students and lyle brumm i ca n't resist a few puns earl told the assembled i 've only been able to come here today because of the dogged determination you 've shown if the dogged rep. ed trimmer has his way kansas will not follow the lead of georgia which tried and failed to honor the golden retriever in 1991 then gave up the matter entirely instead trimmer hopes kansas will join wisconsin et al as the 12 th u.s. state to select and honor an official dog if that happens the cairn terrier will join the barred tiger salamander amphibian the ornate box turtle reptile and the little bluestem grass as state symbols you just never know about a bill like this trimmer told the wichita eagle capturing the essence of canine legislation sometimes they take a while and sometimes they fly right through slate logo slate group logo slate is
