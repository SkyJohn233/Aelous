amazing experiences i have ever had it was the first time i really felt seen and heard and welcome to be just me i would be happy to literally stay in that space with so many women forever i had a space where i was able to really just let goooo and lean into my sisters and feel supported it gave me a much more solid foundation for letting go on my own i have been encouraged to take the community love and unity experienced so immediately there and implement it in my own life and community the queen is emerging i becoming more and more who i came here to be and more clear on what i came here to do i ve held a lot of animosity toward my mother for not meeting my expectations after sarah s clearing ancestral lines meditation i pulled a card that allowed me to see that her behaviors are not a fault of her own and that her brokenness was inherited by generations and lifetimes of pain i was able to forgive her and transform my anger into empathy my understanding and expectations of her will forever be changed sarah is leading the world in a big way and it inspires me to ripple my own gifts thank you for your powerful leadership your openness honesty self-expression bravery and trust in your own gifts is a marvel i was super aware of my edges my own internal self critical dialogue i was super aware of my own discomfort and awkwardnesses but then sometimes within the same 60 seconds i would experience a crack an opening that would surge through my body like i was hitting my own unique soul tuning fork sarah is the genuine goods she is her
