Founded in 1991, Andlauer Transportation Services (ATS / ATS Healthcare) is the industry leader in temperature controlled transportation. In 2002, ATS began offering pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers the first Ambient Service in Canada – a complete solution to address temperature management and security objectives. A corporate decision was made to focus on the growing demand for temperature controlled services, which resulted in ATS selling the retail portion of the company in 2009 to concentrate business solely on the healthcare industry. ATS Healthcare currently handles a significant amount of business from top pharmaceutical companies in Canada. We are focused on providing a comprehensive array of services required by healthcare related businesses to transport their products.  ATS’ branches are located across Canada, coast-to-coast, covering all major Canadian cities. Our facilities feature complete climate temperature control, monitored 24/7 with inflatable baffle loading docks to prevent air leaks and maintain temperatures during open-door loading. Our auto-sort barcode conveyor systems ensure higher sort speed and capacity.
