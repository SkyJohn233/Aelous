Welcome students and parents.  This site is designed for students currently in my math classes as well as their parents and guardians.  I am currently teaching Geometry and Advanced Geometry.  This is my 7th year teaching at CDO and I absolutely love the students and faculty.  I graduated from CDO in 1980 and it is great to be back in "Dorado Land". Defining Moment Realizing that I enjoyed the "aha" feeling when I  learned something new, was my defining moment.  I decided teaching would be a career that would allow me to share the excitement that students experience when they understand a new concept. Core Educational Belief I believe that all students can learn and be life long learners.  Therefore I strive to provide diverse educational opportunities that encourage my students to become innovative and knowledgeable about mathematics in order to pursue future endeavors.
