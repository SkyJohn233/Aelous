Solved: The Ideal Gas Law PV=nRT Relates Pressure P, Volum... | Chegg.com Skip Navigation  2003-2019 Chegg Inc. All rights reserved.                         Privacy & Terms | View desktop site The ideal gas law PV=nRT relates pressure P, volume V,\ntemperature T, and number of moles of a gas, n. The gas constant R\nequals 0.08206 L⋅atm/(K⋅mol) or 8.3145 J/(K⋅mol). The equation can\nbe rearranged as follows to solve for n: n=PVRT This equation is\nuseful when dealing with gaseous reactions because stoichiometric\ncalculations involve mole ratios. Part A When heated, calcium carbonate decomposes to yield calcium oxide\nand carbon dioxide gas via the reaction CaCO3(s)→CaO(s)+CO2(g) What\nis the mass of calcium carbonate needed to produce 53.0 L of carbon\ndioxide at STP? Express your answer with the appropriate units. Part B Butane, C4H10, is a component of natural gas that is used as\nfuel for cigarette lighters. The balanced equation of the complete\ncombustion of butane is 2C4H10(g)+13O2(g)→8CO2(g)+10H2O(l) At 1.00\natm and 23 ∘C, what is the volume of carbon dioxide formed by the\ncombustion of 3.80 g of butane? Express your answer with the\nappropriate units. The ideal gas law PV=nRT relates pressure P, volume V,temperature T, and number of moles of a gas, n.
