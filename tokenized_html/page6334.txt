eighteenth-century ephemera page 2 site dedicated to the study of eighteenth-century visual and material culture site dedicated to the study of eighteenth-century visual and material culture in the first decade since his accession to the throne in 1760 george iii had been portrayed in political prints as a passive onlooker to the misdeeds orchestrated by his favourite lord bute the young monarch was drawn as the english lion however instead of roaring boldly the prints depicted him either muzzled or slumbering peacefully while his scottish-born prime minister plundered the nation these types of images served the propagandist purposes of the radical wilkite faction spearheaded by john wilkes and his allies by portraying george iii as uninvolved in the corruption that the wilkites saw pervading the establishment politics they avoided direct criticism of the king which would have possibly alienated support for their causes instead they provoked their base by blaming the scottish for taking advantage of the english and for that lord bute was the perfect target towards the late 1760s with bute long gone and as the crisis in the american colonies grew the wilkites expanded their criticism of the king wilkes had returned to london in 1768 from his exile in paris and was swiftly elected as a member of the parliament for middlesex subsequently he was sentenced for two years in prison for seditious libel on the charges that had hounded him since 1763 the protests orchestrated by his supporters in front of the king s bench prison quickly turned violent as troops opened fire on the crowd this event on 10 may 1768 became known as st. george s fields massacre and it left seven people dead and over a dozen wounded it also marked a shift in the way george iii was represented in wilkite pictorial propaganda from then on in fact political prints of the early 1770s tended to represent the king in two ways the wilkite faction portrayed him as a tyrant destabilizing the constitution while more moderate critics depicted him as a monarch too uninterested in the matters of his realm to see it was rupturing from its seams this latter portrayal saw george iii as the benevolent and absent-minded farmer george who was too distracted by his hobbies astronomy and button collecting to pay attention to his own children and by extension to the nation 1 in the wilkite prints however george iii became something more sinister a continuation of a long line of rulers who meddled in the nation s affairs with catastrophic consequences the two prints depicting george iii as the roman emperor nero appear after the massacre at st. george s fields they paint an image of the king as someone unable to digest any dissenting opinions and as someone who habitually places his own needs above those of the nation nero fiddling rome burning pompaja agrippina smiling bm cat 4381 was featured in the oxford magazine in may 1770 the publication of the image coincides with three notable events that spring the boston massacre that had taken place on 5 march an address on 14 march to the king by the lord mayor of london william beckford 1707-1770 who was an ardent supported of john wilkes and the release of john wilkes from prison nero fiddling rome burning imagines george iii as nero in roman military garb accompanied by his wife charlotte as nero s wife poppaea and more significantly the king s mother the princess of wales as agrippina the domineering mother of nero while this modern nero is fiddling away london or more specifically st. paul s burns in the background the speech bubbles given to the royal family continue the ruthless visual onslaught what a charming blaze this shall make them know i am their master george iii remarks while his mother encourages her son by saying my son you have done well they are all rebels but you should have got their money from them first probably referring to the numerous attempts to tax the american colonies in the aftermath of the seven years war the vulgar display is underlined by the king supporting his leg on two heavy tomes titled laws of humanity and laws of discretion the decision to portray george iii as the callous nero must have had equally to do with the effective comparison of princess of wales to agrippina indeed during the 1760s numerous political prints had drawn similarities between the king s mother and other historical antecedents such as queen isabella and mary queen of scots while her rumoured paramour lord bute was depicted as mortimer and rhezzio the lovers of these two historical queens to counter these offending comparisons benjamin west had painted agrippina landing in brundisium with the ashes of germanicus in 1768 in which the princess of wales was the model for agrippina the painting was supposed to give a more noble historical comparison to the king s mother and perhaps rehabilitate agrippina s contemporary reputation instead the comparison was used to mock the princess of wales in subsequent pictorial propaganda 2 also it should be noted that around the time this satire was published gossip abounded in the political circles of london regarding the secret influence of the king s mother horace walpole in a letter to horace mann on 15 march 1770 quoted william pitt as stating that this influence was more mighty than majesty itself 3 walpole s letter occasioned a day after beckford gave his address to the king in march moreover on 23 may around the publication date of the print in the oxford magazine beckford publicly attacked george iii in a speech in which he demanded that the king dissolve the parliament beckford died the following month from natural causes the source of the print oxford magazine was a publication that frequently featured satyrical and political cards and was aimed to fill the market-position between the radical wilkite publication political register and gentleman s magazine a more refined publication that featured mostly articles 4 that said nero fiddling rome burning is a decidedly wilkite image and it would have accompanied a corresponding article in the magazine suggesting a growing sympathy for wilkes and the wilkite cause beyond his core group of supporters certainly the image comes during a high point for the wilkites as wilkes was released from prison and subsequently appointed sheriff for the city of london in the spring of 1770 the second satirical print depicting george iii as the cold-blooded emperor is the eponymous nero the exact publication date of which is unknown considering the subject matter the format and size the image measures 12.9 x 8.4 cm it is probable that this image was also published in a magazine in the print george iii as nero is represented in the form of an equestrian statue as three men have gathered around to mock the king s visage the revealing feature of the print is the cap of liberty which the king s horse is squashing underneath its hoof this is strong evidence to suggest that the print was manufactured by the wilkite faction whose emblem the cap was furthermore the striking visual of the king pointing a pistol at the three observers around him could be a reference to the st. george s fields massacre and the power of the crown another reason to believe in the print s wilkite origins is the verse at the bottom of the image one of the headmen of gotham caused a statue of himself to be erected in the character of marcus aurelius but the statuary knowing nothing of that prince took his likeness from nero the mention of gotham is most likely a reference to a 1764 poem by charles churchill titled gotham churchill was a staunch early supporter of john wilkes as well as his co-author on the scurrilous publication north briton gotham is a satire on england and its rulers suggesting rather what a true king of england should be like its mention in nero suggests that the author of the print considers george iii as an unworthy ruler as for the date of the image the british museum catalogue of prints and drawings gives a very general suggestion regarding the publication date between 1760 and 1780 however the subject matter and representation indicate a more specific date between 1770 and 1772 it would make sense for nero to appear around the same time as nero fiddling rome burning as many political prints borrowed visual cues from one another besides this image 1770 also saw at least one other political print that referenced nero old nero look d on burning rome so cool he play d the fiddle but you play the fool bm cat 4404 published in the freeholder s magazine in july 1770 the print refers to a fire at portsmouth dockyard earlier that month and while it features the king s younger brother the duke of cumberland the king himself is not present in addition to the two prints portraying george iii as nero that are discussed here no other similar images survive which also suggests that the prints were published in close succession the way george iii is presented in nero as an equestrian statue is also telling first of all the mock-heroic depiction of the conquering hero on a horse recalls the earlier satires on the king s uncle the previous duke of cumberland that appeared after the battle of culloden in 1746 5 perhaps nero took inspiration from both nero fiddling rome burning and old nero look d on as it alludes to both in terms of style and royal familial relations secondly and more significantly plans for an equestrian statue of george iii were commissioned in 1766 notably the statue was meant to portray the king in roman armour similarly to his depiction in nero the statue erected in 1772 was commissioned by the king s sister princess amelia for berkeley square in london 6 the plans for the statue including information on how the king was to be depicted were published in the annual register no 9 in 1766 it would make sense that nero was published either in 1770 to coincide with the two other similar prints or in 1772 in conjunction with the unveiling of the equestrian statue of george iii these two examples of george iii as nero speak of the growing condemnation of the king by the wilkites in the 1770s the majority of wilkite prints during that decade utilized allusions and references to go after the monarch up until the very end of the decade when the prints dropped the facade of innuendo and attacked the monarch head-on 7 this hardening visual language against george iii by the wilkites coincided with their struggle to remain relevant as the conflict in the american colonies grew into a war from the mid-1770s onward establishment opposition to the prolonged rule of lord north was revitalized by figures such as charles james fox as the more radical wilkites were relegated to the margins 1780 was the watershed year for wilkes and his supporters wilkes personal popularity nose-dived in that year in relation to his involvement in the gordon riots and the wilkite faction withered soon after 1 for example farmer g-e studying the wind and weather bm cat 4883 from 1771 presents the king failing to mind his attention-deprived offspring while gazing

established napoleon s brother joseph bonaparte as the king of spain the satire depicts a corpulent spider his body marked with words unbound ambition featuring napoleon s face and his infamous bicorne decorated with plumes caught right at the centre of the spider s intricate web are the spanish flies one of which is already being consumed while the other terrified nations also depicted as insects or as human-insect hybrids wait their turn to be devoured by the corsican spider as the spider eyes his next victim the austrian fly the pope fly becomes increasingly entangled in the web exclaiming i am afraid i shall be dragged in only the flies still outside the web have maintained their human faces with the exception of the pipe-smoking dutch fly set in the spider s path the russian fly at this point engaged in the finnish war with sweden considers himself lucky i declare i was half in the web before i made the discovery naturally the most cunning of the flies is the john bull-like british fly buzzing outside the netting ay you may look master spider but i am not to be caught in your web overall the design of the print is simple but effective the margins of the image a stylistic feature popular in the satirical prints of the period also functions as a support structure for the enormous web rowlandson 1756-1827 was trained at the royal academy and after encountering financial hardship he became a caricaturist at the suggestion of his friends and fellow caricaturists james gillray 1756-1815 and henry bunbury 1750-1811 by this time the 1790s caricatural prints had become a relatively lucrative way to make a living and no longer carried the stigma of impoliteness that had obscured them for the greater part of the century behind this shift in the status of the political print was an ideological change affecting pictorial political propaganda in the years following the end of the american revolutionary war decline in the wilkite faction s popularity coincided with a renewed strength of the opposition which in turn reinvigorated the political discourse in britain figures such as william pitt the younger 1759-1806 charles james fox 1749-1806 edmund burke 1730-1797 and william petty the 2 nd earl of shelburne 1737-1805 were frequent fodder for the emerging golden age caricaturists namely gillray rowlandson and isaac cruikshank 1764-1811 this ideological change was in turn marked by an adjustment in the visual representation of political pictorial propaganda in most generalized terms this adjustment may be described as a shift from an emblematic depiction to a portrayal defined by caricatural features this shift was in no way straightforward and i will not go into great detail regarding its myriad history but suffice to say that until the 1780s the visual language of pictorial political propaganda was dominated by the emblematic style this style was derived from the allegorical illustrations of emblem books espousing good morals in the form of a poem and a corresponding illustration these books were popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and although they were still in print in the eighteenth century their popularity was in decline visual shorthands introduced in emblem books such as the dismembered hand reaching from a cloud that suggested divine intervention was transfigured in the political prints as the interfering hand of the state the demand for a new type of representation the caricatural style was heralded by the increasingly popular macaroni-images mocking the excessive fashions of the day that emerged in the mid-1760s as neutral alternatives to the heavily politicized images circulated by the wilkite faction popularized by the most esteemed parts of the society caricatures steadily gained prominence in britain from the 1740s onward and broke into mainstream in the second half of the 1750s when the aristocratic george townshend 1724-1807 infused caricatural depiction with emblematic imagery in his political prints mocking the newcastle administration towards the end of the american revolutionary war the wilkite faction had depleted the emblematic vocabulary in their zeal to promote their cause so a new type of visual vocabulary was required for a new kind of visual propaganda emerging in the period marked by the catholic emancipation and the french revolution these events coincided with the decline in the number of emblem books that were published towards the end of the eighteenth century as their numbers became fewer the emblem books became more juvenile in nature many dropped their descriptive verses entirely and focused on imagery subsequently emblem books were relegated to the status of children s literature similar to the fate that had met the once popular jest-book tradition it is therefore intriguing to recognize the visual similarities between rowlandson s design of the corsican spider and an emblem book image from silenus alcibiadis 1618 by jacob cats 1577-1660 the title of the image in question non intrandum aut penetrandum illustration xxxix translates into if you do not know the game stay away from it an apt moral lesson for the nations engaged in the napoleonic wars the emblem book image depicts a window covered by a spider s web with the plump spider situated at the centre ready to catch its prey several flies are already in the web and their placing is uncannily similar to the nations-as-flies found in rowlandson s print it is almost as if rowlandson has merely zoomed in on cats s illustration to reveal a more detailed scene unfolding before our eyes rowlandson s print also borrows the dark clouds gathering at the top of the illustration to signal the looming storm that awaits europe rowlandson like many of his contemporary caricaturists had access to emblem books they were either sitting on their bookshelves and work stations or lying around in the print- and bookshops they frequented considering the swift publication of the image only four days after the bayonne charter was announced to ensure topicality of the subject matter rowlandson must have turned to cats s tome for the general design of his print the added value of the moral lesson now revised as a cruel joke on the warring nations must have been tantalizing to the audience of the print who understood the reference the corsican spider in his web suggests that perhaps the familiarity with emblematic imagery was not as old-fashioned among the public that consumed these images as has been previously proposed the spider and his web as depicted by cats and similar imagery in other emblem books was in the beginning of the nineteenth century still presumably a part of a recognizable visual shorthand with its moral message well-remembered from the numerous editions of emblem books now evolved into children s riddles © henna karhapää the corsican spider in his web © trustees of the british museum illustration xxxix from silenus alcibiadis is in public domain full text for the emblem book may be found here from its inception the individually sold political pictorial print had occupied an ideological position of distance from other printed products in the marketplace which meant its legal status remained largely undefined the royally chartered worshipful company of stationers and newspaper makers had held exclusive rights in the english publication industry since the mid-sixteenth century which meant that no product passed their watchful eyes until the enactment of the statute of anne in 1709 the statute allowed printed products to be more easily produced and distributed which in turn led to the significant expansion of the market for printed products in the eighteenth century as the stationers company was waning in influence towards the end of the seventeenth century lawmakers began to rely on libel legislation in order to control the perceived anti-establishment behaviour that had found its nesting ground in the coffee houses and printing shops of london printed products such as newspapers and pamphlets were the first to experience the ire of the state while the eighteenth century saw the libel legislation being utilized to threaten printmakers although the threats rarely led to actual prosecution 1 the term libel had been recognized as a form of defamation since the early sixteenth century during that time both libel written defamation and slander spoken defamation were undistinguished from one another the burden of evidence was regularly placed on the defamed who had to demonstrate consequences amounting to actual damage to reputation in order to win their case in court the eighteenth-century political pictorial print was relatively safe from libel prosecution because it had developed a series of pictorial ciphers or emblems and allegorical language as a form of protection from being detected as scurrilous propaganda of course the public knew the prints were offensive and who they offended after all part of the pleasure in engaging with these items was a sense of exhilaration of doing something morally frowned upon a shared secret or more specifically a popular culture of references based on a commonly understood language similar to the modern day superhero movies with all their clever easter eggs that signal the viewer s uniqueness when they get the reference the eighteenth-century political pictorial print utilized visual language to create exclusivity in its consumers none were more adept in taking advantage of this exclusivity than the faction of the wilkites the supporters of the radical politician and early populist john wilkes during the 1760s and 1770s the wilkites repurposed the political print to their own political ends which led political pictorial propaganda largely marginalized as the device of the faction until a renewed need for opposition propaganda in britain during the american revolutionary war 2 with their own set of visual signifiers directly related to their ideological interests as well as allegorical references to the civil war of the previous century that emphasized the wilkites struggle against government that they saw taking advantage of the people the prints had created a visual system so complex it was practically impervious from prosecution this should have made the wilkites very happy after all they had a communication system with their members and supporters that allowed them to share their ideological viewpoints without the fear of censure or prosecution the only problem was that the wilkite faction thrived on conflict especially the kind of conflict that they could say demonstrated the government s persecution of anyone who did not agree with them the thin-skinned lord john bute who ascended the position of prime minister in may 1762 had been the perfect target for the wilkites as he seemed very eager to defend his honour from the scurrilous propaganda permeating on the streets of london more on john wilkes s campaign against bute may be found here in september of 1762 rumours were abound in london that general warrants were issued against those print- and booksellers who traded in anti-bute prints newspapers featured accounts of messengers being dispatched to hand out these warrants and the atmosphere was that of apprehension one commentator notified the public that … in less than ten minutes time the whole trade were seized with such a pannic sic and became for very loyal that nothing but kings and queens heads were to be seen in their windows all the numerous political commodities being sent off with the greatest pricipitation sic 3 subsequently it was reported that two principal persons had been arrested for publishing political prints and a few days later a new alarm was raised for more warrants that led many printshops to substitute their scurrilous ware mockingly with william hogarth s new print the times bm cat 3970 a print that was viewed as pro-establishment propaganda the general warrants turned out to be a false alarm and no prosecution followed the rumours were most likely spread by the wilkites themselves who were desirous to represent the bute ministry as an arbitrary force infringing upon the rights of the free-born englishmen perhaps not surprisingly a year later when hogarth published his notorious mock-portrait of john wilkes several enraged wilkites wrote to newspapers demanding hogarth to be charged with libel 4 when those calls proved unsuccessful the wilkites made the offensive print their own and began celebrating the squinty-eyed representation of wilkes as an authentic portrait of their beloved ringleader stating that it showed how unpretentious wilkes was warts and all the libel panic lasted only a few days but spread to the entire city in which printshops were littered from piccadilly to holborn fleet street and st. paul s. the self-generated panic served the wilkites well they had created mistrust between the general populace and the government furthered their claim that the scottish-born bute was meddling in english affairs and placed wilkes and his followers as the champions of free speech who bravely resisted the establishment one could only imagine what they would have accomplished with twitter 1 two notable exceptions being the printsellers john williams and john almon who were prosecuted in the 1760s for printing subversive material significantly although both sold political prints their prosecution came about their role in the reproduction of offensive text demonstrating how challenging it was to control and censor pictorial political propaganda 2 for more see m. dorothy george s english political caricature a study in

karhapää images © trustees of the british museum my article on matthew darly the eighteenth-century printmaker and furniture designer has recently been published by the ephemerist this article looks at three of darly s trade cards from the 1750s and 1760s and argues that he not only utilized these pieces of paper to promote himself in the ever increasingly differentiated marketplace for printed products during mid-eighteenth century but that he also wanted to cultivate a very specific image of himself to his prospective clients i thank the british ephemera society for the chance to share my research and would like to direct the readers of this blog to the work they do the ephemera society i will aim to publish new posts on eighteenth-century ephemera soon on this site apologies for the long delay recuperating from the magnificent fog cloud of phd research has taken its time there was an extensive disparity in the quality of humour on offer in eighteenth-century political prints that varied from imagery deemed polite enough to be shared with dinner quests to crude pictures enjoyed in private one of the sub-categories of pictorial political humour popular throughout the eighteenth century was the scatological print that emphasized not only a very bawdy representation of current issues but also frequently employed what is more commonly known today as toilet humour naturally men were able to consume these obscene images in groups away from the womenfolk and some even kept a stash in their privies indeed there is something very meta about including scatological imagery in one s lavatory and undoubtedly some printmakers manufactured scatological imagery for this purpose alone particularly from the years of robert walpole s rule to the end of the north ministry political prints reveled in comparing the state of the nation to bodily functions from passing wind to the act of what is called be-shitting offering humiliation for the subject of the satire and acting as a metaphor for the general grievances of the public while scatological images were frequently utilized during the walpole era most famously the festival of the golden rump from 1737 published in relation to walpole s zeal to close down the theatres their use diminished by the 1750s with paul sandby s satire on william hogarth the analyst besh-n in his own taste pr 1s from 1753 being among the few fecal-related images of the decade in the aftermath of the loss of minorca in may 1756 and following admiral john byng s subsequent court-martial and execution his corpse was desecrated in adml byng s last chance or the board of adr-ty assembled 1757 with one member of the admiralty trying to resuscitate byng by blowing air through a straw to his backside bawdy and rude imagery was reintroduced in the early 1760s when lord john bute came into power in the roasted exciseman or jack boot s exit from 1763 a donkey-eared bute is hanged and his kilt is lifted to reveal that he has no manhood between his legs while in the wheel of fortune or england in tears from c. 1766 bute defecates on britannia even more obscene is the vision or m-n-st-l monster from 1762 in which william hogarth is depicted as bute s erect phallus what is more in as you like it or english gratitude 1763 depicts a bagpipe that is drawn to look like a phallus and in scotch colossus c. 1762 bute s small sword is meant to resemble his manhood another print on bute also titled scotch colossus and included in matthew and mary darlys political and satirical history -series depicts bute standing legs spread on two jackboots while the dowager princess stands between his legs reaching towards the phallic bagpipe bute holds between his legs in another image included in the political and satirical history -series provision for the scotch convent from 1762 the dowager princess carries bute in a giant jackboot the phallic spur of which is fondled by her with a smile on her face for those unfamiliar with eighteenth-century slang convent was a euphemism for brothel sawney in the bog-house first introduced by charles mosley in 1745 and later reworked by james gillray in 1779 demonstrate the growing unease towards the scottish in the aftermath of the culloden and later during the american revolutionary war when the british armed forces recruited a number of scots to fight in the colonies gillray s print was most likely a response to the papist act of 1778 which was meant to enable the catholics to purchase and inherit land and considering many scots were catholic this was seen as a way to appease the scottish population and encourage them to join the battle to defend the british empire across the atlantic both versions of the print depict a scotsman tauntingly named as sawney sitting in an outhouse with his legs down the toilet shoots the image suggests simple-mindedness on the part of the scottish as well as an underlying fear that people such as the sawney might threaten the livelihoods of the english now that they have been given even the most rudimentary of human rights in the british society in fact many prints drew attention to the uncivilized way in which the scots conducted themselves while the sawney in the boghouse had suggested that their alienation from basic manners was so great that they could not even use the privy the flowers of edinburgh from 1781 depicted a woman throwing urine and feces from her window on three scotsmen on the street one of whom is in the process of relieving himself to a bucket the purpose of this type of imagery was to convey the basic rudeness of the scots their ability to make themselves at home wherever they went and their lack of personal boundaries while one of the figures in the print expresses mild discontent towards the woman throwing excrement on him and his companions the other two are decidedly less bothered the visual effect in this print is achieved by juxtaposing a clean young lady disposing a bucket of filth on three haggard looking men in a highland-dress the trajectory of the feces forms an arch directed towards the soup the men are preparing for dinner the repulsion is underlined by the steam from the kettle combining with the excrement and one of the men pouring urine from a bucket on his own leg defecation or urination in political prints was the ultimate way to express an opinion on pressing matters and it was made even more obscene when combined with eating or preparing dinner as in the flowers of edinburgh in thomas cornell s the patriotic soup for poor old england from 1780 a sailor defecates into a soup kettle stirred by politicians to protest at the treatment of admiral augustus keppel after the battle of ushant in 1778 and his subsequent court-martial that acquitted him from wrong-doing moreover your petitioner sheweth from the same year shows a republican defecating into a crown and urinating into a mitre in the aftermath of the gordon riots the engagement between d orvilliers k-p-l 1780 proposes an alternative narrative of the naval engagement of the battle of ushant that led to admiral keppel s court-martial instead of taking place at sea the french admiral louis guillouet comte d orvilliers and admiral keppel engage each other on land as the frenchman shoots urine from his backside towards keppel the british admiral answers the action by lunging a series of feces directly at d orvilliers the farcical nature of the action underlined the british public s frustration regarding the outcome of the battle while both fleets had been of comparable size the battle had ended on an uncertain note and the parties came under attack for mismanaging orders on the french side d orvilliers accused louis philippe duc de chartres for his inability to engage with the enemy while on the english side hugh palliser had not followed keppel s orders and followed the french fleet on this occasion the reduction of an important military engagement to a childish game represented the embarrassment of the failure to bring about a decisive victory the verse below the image brought forward the accusation that keppel and d orvilliers fight with their a sses suggesting that both parties fled the seen of the battle yet neither prevails how can it be when they both turn their tails the admirals smiling faces are contrasted with the actual battle taking place in the background furthermore the steam emitted from keppel s backside finds a companion in the dark clouds gathering above the fleet the state of the nation published both as an etching and as a mezzotint from 1778 portrays a series of british citizens relieving themselves in the bog-house the upper-row is reserved for seven gentlemen in various stages of defecating while the bottom row consists of seven ladies some dignified some ponderous and others exerting themselves to produce material the three surviving impressions housed at the british museum were published by william and hannah humphrey and william holland respectively the verse on the print draws attention to the motions that occur in the bog-house and the parliament by stating that in a certain great house that there is in this land when a motion is made on your feet you must stand but in this little house it is quite the reverse when a motion is made you must sit on your the print is reproduced in william humphrey s the privy council two years later in which it decorates the wall of a privy visited by lords north mansfield and sandwich ministerial purgations or state grippings from the following year 1779 utilizes similar structure but brings the politicians to the bog-house to relieve themselves with the devil occupying the position in one of the stalls the print shows lords north mansfield sandwich george germain and parson bate seeking to relieve their greed and adequately suffering to attain it l n on the stool of repentance or the ill affects of meddling with salts from 1782 on the other hand sketched lord north towards the end of his ministry on the toilet as if it were the naughty step trying to fill the treasury and enrich the country with his offering while he readies to wipe himself with a page from the london courant all three of these prints deployed humorous rhyming verses to contrast with the scatological visual content and were in line with the type of humour found in contemporary jest-books such as the popular joe miller s jests or the wits vade-mecum editions of which appeared throughout the century another way of expressing frustration was the act of mooning many of the prints published during the seven years war and the bute ministry employed this way of expression to articulate their feelings towards the french and the unpopular prime minister the whiskers or sr jno sucklings bugg-a-bohs from 1757 depict the french mooning at john mordaunt to ridicule him for failing to capture rochefort while in tit for tat or kiss my a – e is no treason included in the political and satirical history -series both bute and the dowager princess offer their rumps to be kissed by de bussy the french peace envoy for his gratitude over the generous terms of the treaty of paris the act of bearing one s backside was associated in these prints as being inherently french an exception is the difference from 1758 in which britannia moons the king of prussia and even then her modesty is covered by underwear other acts of scatological expression in political prints were represented by vomiting and passing wind in pukeation on answer to the late state of the nation from 1783 the ministerial candidates hang onto their posts while vomit comes out of their mouths in reference to the unreliable nature of their political promises while gillray s the times anno 1783 also from 1783 depicts a winged demon flying away with america while a trapped wind exclaiming poor john bull ha ha ha escapes from his backside many of the jest-books and comic miscellanies published as chap-books throughout the eighteenth century featured tales of bodily functions to entertain so it was no wonder that the topic would also be included in visual form in political prints after all the depiction of defecation urination vomiting and passing wind acted as powerful imagery that could be deployed to underline the feeling that he country was going down the toilet so to speak while the imagery itself was crude its utilization was ingenious by turning bodily functions into an allegory their depiction went from mere shock tactic to an opinion piece numerous prints targeted the scots by utilizing fecal imagery the reasons for this were twofold on one hand the prints continued the proliferation of the stories widely circulating through oral tradition regarding the scotsmen s sexual prowess and their disregard for personal hygiene on the other the prints aimed to humiliate the scots and elevate the manners of the englishmen hoping to prove that the former were incapable of assimilating into the civilized society on many occasions the scatological aspect functioned as an allegory to express disbelief in the way the governance of the nation was conducted from the disrespect of the politicians relieving themselves in relation to peace negotiations to established military officers engaging in an activity decidedly unbecoming of them the prints subsequently made mockery of the absurdity of war © henna karhap ää dear all my apologies for not updating this site for some while i recently started working in a new job as the head of museum education at joensuu art museum joensuu which is located in eastern finland is my hometown and i was elated to have been offered the opportunity to work there after finishing my doctoral thesis i aim to continue writing for this site as eighteenth century ephemeral and material culture are still among my main passions hopefully i can get the next article up within the fortnight thank you for your patience yours faithfully henna joensuu art museum image © henna karhap ää with the upcoming presidential election in the united states and this june s brexit vote in the uk political rhetoric appears to have reached a whole new level however this seemingly lowered standard of political debate is nothing new in the anglo-saxon world as the indiscriminate political print culture of the eighteenth century demonstrates in fact well before the so-called golden age of caricature that gave us thomas rowlandson isaac cruikshank and most notably james gillray emblematic political prints introduced during the english civil war and popularized under william iii s rule depicted scenes that are shocking to us even today the glorious minority in 1763 with the head of the majority blason d suggests in a very straightforward manner that lord john bute the extremely unpopular scottish-born prime minister should be beheaded the banner underneath his severed head stating that what pity it is he can die but once to serve his country this mock-heroic tone very popular at the time would later be appropriated by the more ernest patriotic rhetoric of the american colonists at the onset of the american revolutionary war as exemplified by the famous quote assigned to nathan hale i only regret that i have but one life to lose for my country the glorious minority in 1763 with the head of the majority blason d © trustees of the british museum the glorious minority is a complex image filled with recognizable personages symbolic and emblematic language and references to historical events even the title references the glorious revolution of 1688 that saw the overthrow of james ii who was seen as a threat to the protestant england and the introduction of william of orange as william iii as the king of england ireland and scotland the following year this type of rhetoric was frequently employed by john wilkes and his supporters the wilkites i will not go into too much detail on the origins and context of the wilkite faction or wilkes himself as i have discussed them before see inspired by horrible histories and the north briton but i will say that one important aspect of the iconography of the faction was to position themselves as defenders of the english nation and the protestant religion sometimes their constant referencing of the political and revolutionary events of the seventeenth century were somewhat contradictory as is the general rhetoric of any populist faction as they celebrated william iii s accession and at the same time promoted oliver cromwell s republican ideas for them this was most likely a way to elevate the notion of a balance between the king lords and commons frequently portrayed as the pillars that sustain the english constitution and to ensure that not one of those elements is favoured over the other the inclusion of wilkes in the glorious minority top right is significant as he is here the witness of bute s punishment thus validating the grievances of the wilkites the wilkites were opposed to bute because he was scottish i.e foreign had a close relationship with george iii who bute tutored in the monarch s adolescence and was rumoured to have been the lover of the king s mother the princess dowager therefore bute in the eyes of wilkes and his supporters was wielding too much power over the king and when appointed as the prime minister he could influence the lords and commons as well bute s rapid political ascension was hence a threat to the constitutional balance of the nation and the wilkites sought to pillory the prime minister through political propaganda as exemplified by graphic satire broadsides poems newspaper articles and most notably the publication of the north briton bute s prime ministerial residency lasted less than a year from 26 may 1762 to 8 april 1763 and he was said to have resigned over these personal public humiliations however this resignation had little effect and the wilkite faction that thrived until the gordon riots of 1780 continued to believe bute was guiding the king s hand until the former s death in 1792 for thirty years bute s effigies were burned across england his house was sacked by a mob and his carriage was attacked today s pillorying of political figures on have i got news for you seems very tame compared to the eighteenth-century treatment of political figures although it must be said that alex salmond s effigy was burnt in lewes in 2014 in the the aftermath of the scottish independence referendum curiously the effigy was clutching the figure 45 in reference to the percentage of scots voting for independence the figure of course also being a historical reference to the 1745 jacobite rebellion and the most infamous issue of the north briton that was in turn a jibe on the scottish the incident at lewes demonstrates that the culture of political cross-referencing is alive and well in britain and although the contemporary political caricatures have been seemingly simplified for quicker ocular consumption political satire still thrives in the 21 st century similarly eighteenth-century political prints sought to reference past and current political debate while drawing on wider issues of morality politeness and reputation in the glorious minority bute s very life-like severed head is affixed to a pike sticking out of a jar while a roundel of thistles decorates the scene this representational choice is necessitated by the eighteenth-century libel laws although many wilkites who were most likely behind the commissioned image courted legal troubles as they could use them as evidence of governmental oppression the figures in the background of the print represent the political minority members including william pitt and john wilkes while next to wilkes is a figure whose features are obscured by an eclipsing sun most likely george iii this could be an imputation on george iii for taking on a perceivably more tyrannical role in politics as sun king was the moniker of louis xiv of france a catholic monarch whose long reign was marked by the absolute power of the king the majority of the scene comprises of a curtain marked tappeserie du roy which acts as a stage setting for bute and is another reference to the french monarchy the curtain was a variation of the emblem of the screen which was utilized in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to suggest something concealed as well as truth coming to light the curtain is decorated with a variety of scenes not least a number of disembodied hands clasped in prayer the disembodied hand was another emblem familiarized through emblem books which commonly depicted hands as originators of action to set scenes such as balancing a scale or lighting a fire on top left of the curtain the english lion roars under my paw as it tramples naked figures this is a reference to the power wielded by bute as george iii s proxy below this scene is false joseph his mistress alluding to bute s rumoured affair with the king s mother notice the tartan-patterned stockings of joseph fatality depicted on the right hand side of the curtain shows death in his customary skeletal form at the tower of london the site of bute s fictional execution death is holding a roundel that includes the figure of justice while a half-concealed ribbon on the ground reads magna a reference to the magna carta which was an important aspect of the wilkite symbolism also on the ground are a mask and a book entitled accusations bute is shown to the left of death with his head still attached to his body trying to flee the scene below fatality is a representation of a child in a cradle overseen by death and time the british museum catalogue of prints and drawings vol iv suggests that this references the appointment of george iii s second son as the bishop of osnaburg while he was still an infant however this appointment occurred in february 1764 and the prince was not born until august 1763 four months after the publication of the glorious revolution april 1763 it is more likely that this scene is a memento mori and its placement opposite of the bedroom scene between bute and the princess dowager could act as a suggestion of illegitimacy of the royal line decorating the jar acting as the base for bute s separated head are a lion and a unicorn associated with the royal coat of arms for united kingdom the lion is fighting a snake coiled around it while the unicorn lifts the curtain to reveal a battle scene occurring in the background which either references the civil war or the recently concluded seven years war underneath is a motto referring to the fleeting nature of glory that reminds once again that bute has reached higher than he should have this is underlined by the jar reading a jarr full to the north for a bridge which is decorated with the collar of the order of the garter a member of which bute had come to be amidst great public uproar also note the unicorn scratching the jar with its horn the bridge in the verse refers most likely to the bridge on berwick-on-tweed a place customarily reserved for the public display of the heads of traitors the bottom line of the print states that it was sold in may s building covent garden and priced 1 shilling which was a rather high price for a black and white print during this period standard size plain political prints sold usually for 6d. while hand-coloured images fetched 1s the british museum catalogue attributes the design to matthew and mary darly although this is unlikely as they did not trade in the address given in the print and the image is not in their style the british museum online catalogue has correctly attributed the image to the notable print maker and publisher george bickham the younger c. 1706-1771 whose shop was at covent garden his reputation could have also afforded him to price his prints higher than those of his competitors the verse underneath the image reads i have a salve shall answer all intents my conduct shall be just at all events if measured turn out right they are my own if wrong i ll safely throw them on the th – e thus i am arm d against all sad disasters when acts are good they eer mine when bad my masters this criticizes bute s responsibility in the peace negotiations to end the seven years war the treaty was unpopular in england and its terms were perceived to give an unfair advantage to the french it also suggests that bute is hiding behind george iii using the king as a front to his politics a notion which was most notoriously referred to by the north briton no 45 that claimed bute had written the speech george iii gave on the eve of the peace with france in a sense then this print forces bute to appear in front of the curtain unable to hide behind his patron his misdeeds exposed to the nation promising that justice and retribution will come soon © henna karhap ää enter
