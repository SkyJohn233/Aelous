It is our aim to achieve global expansion which isbased on a solid vision of the future, and that is why we began forgingoperations in Malaysia in 1996. Of course this means not only setting upthe basic equipment, but also maintaining the same high level of technologyand production capacity for which our operations in Japan are acknowledged.Based on an intimate system bound by the Internet, we are energeticallycontinuing to develop products with high added value and to embark ourselvesin new business fields. The history of forging is over 6000years old. Forging has also been a major part ot the infrastructure ofJapan's modern industry, and we are proud of the forged products that weproduce. That is why we were the first to meet the challenges of hot forging,cold forging, and complex forging. We have achieved a level of qualityand precision that is among the top in the world and now we are movingtoward being an all-round forger with an even more global focus than before.
