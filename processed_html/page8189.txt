The view file The OrderModel file (simplified)     I can confirm that the config.php file is  definitely  configured correctly and is talking to the DB. In any rate, the code is: I am getting the following error messages from the view file: Warning: mysqli_query(): Couldn't fetch mysqli in D:\UniServerZ\www\alberto\app\models\OrderModel.php on line 31 Warning: mysqli_error(): Couldn't fetch mysqli in D:\UniServerZ\www\alberto\app\models\OrderModel.php on line 35 I suspect the error is to do with the session, but I can't seem to find any answers from the threads posted so far. Please kindly advise. Thank you. Barmar is correct that $this->dbc is not a valid mysqli object. You are using the require_once with the file like a function. Make the config.php a class, and make the db connection from there. See here for an example of what I'm referring to.  https://gist.github.com/jonashansen229/4534794                                 Click here to upload your image                                 (max 2 MiB) Cancel and add another image You can also provide a  link from the web .
