contact customer care consumer purchasers of automotive filters are sometimes told by an automobile dealer-s service writer or mechanic that a brand of replacement filter can not be used in the consumer-s vehicle during the warranty period the claim is made that use of the brand will void the warranty with the statement or implication that only the original equipment brand of filters may be used this of course tends to cast doubt on the quality of the replacement filter that claim is simply not true if the consumer asks for the statement in writing he will not receive it nevertheless the consumer may feel uneasy about using replacement filters that are not original equipment with the large number of do-it-yourselfers who prefer to install their own filters this misleading claim should be corrected under the magnuson moss warranty act 15u.s.c ss 2301-2312 1982 and general principles of the federal trade commission act a manufacturer may not require the use of any brand of filter or any other article unless the manufacturer provides the item free of charge under the terms of the warranty so if the consumer is told that only the original equipment filter will not void the warranty he should request that the oe filter be supplied free of charge if he is charged for the filter the manufacturer will be violating the magnuson moss warranty act and other applicable law by providing this information to consumers the filter manufacturers council can help to combat the erroneous claim that a brand of replacement filter other than the original equipment will void the warranty it should be noted that the magnuson moss warranty act is a federal law that applies to consumer products the federal trade commission has authority to enforce the magnuson moss warranty act including obtaining injunctions and orders containing affirmative relief in addition a consumer can bring suit under the magnuson moss warranty act storetype type store number capitalize address capitalize city
