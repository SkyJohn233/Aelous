Planting emmer wheat..... instructions unclear. (gardening for beginners forum at permies) Dougan Nash wrote: So I'm really interesting in growing wheat. Even though I only have a small back yard, growing my own grains sounds really fun. Even if it doesn't work out - free bird food and straw! I want to grow a non-dwarf ancient wheat so I ordered emmer wheat from baker's seed. It should get here soon. Now last year I accidentally grew wheat from some hay I used as mulch. It over-wintered fine and come spring it shot right up. I can't seem to find any information online weather Emmer is a spring or winter wheat. It's pretty crazy how little information there is out there on this. All I can find is that it is one of the first wheats and it is popular in Italy. Going by that climate, I would assume a spring wheat. Should I try some both seasons and see what works?
