axed in 2014 but were reintroduced for non-eu/eea students in the south-western state of baden-württemberg in autumn 2017 these fees are set at €1,500 per semester – therefore coming to €3,000 per year ~us 3,440 students obtaining a second degree will pay a reduced rate of €650 per semester or €1,300 per year ~us 1,500 students from erasmus member states are exempt from these fees although no longer free tuition fees are still far lower than other popular study destinations it s possible that non-eu/eea tuition fees will be reintroduced to other states in the coming years but for now undergraduate-level tuition at all other public universities in germany remains free of charge for all students both in and outside the eu you will however need to pay a nominal administration fee per semester which is typically no more than €250 ~us 225 for postgraduate students however tuition fees still exist these fees may be avoided or cut dramatically if you have already graduated from an undergraduate program in germany in the last few years if you studied in another country at undergraduate level you are classed as a non-consecutive student and will need to pay tuition fees which will vary between universities and courses for more information about tuition fees in germany see the following under the bologna reform all universities in germany offer internationally recognized degrees a ba or a bsc bachelor of arts bachelor of science will usually take six semesters three years to complete and these are the most common undergraduate degrees for postgraduate studies an ma or

application process program structure and more in our article how to study medicine in germany to study abroad in germany you need to hold a higher education entrance qualification or hochschulzugangsberechtigung hzb this qualification can come in many formats particularly for international students who have gained their school-leaving qualifications in a different country for prospective undergraduate students a high-school diploma school-leaving certificate or university entrance exam result is usually sufficient for postgraduate programs students need to provide an undergraduate degree certificate usually if your qualification would allow you entry into higher education in your home country it will also be sufficient to allow you to apply to german universities to check whether your current qualifications are recognized for study in germany use the form on this page if you find that your qualification is not recognized you are also able to take a preparatory course at a studienkolleg before taking a compulsory assessment test known as a feststellungprüfung this assessment will cover areas that are relevant to the program you wish to study and will prepare you for university if you wish to undertake a program being taught in german the teaching language of most undergraduate programs in germany you will also need to prove your german proficiency see question five below for more information in addition to german-language proficiency and an entrance qualification you may also need to meet the specific entry requirements of your chosen university program these requirements depend on the reputation of the school and of the program and can be found by looking at the program information in the university s prospectus or online the language of instruction at most universities in germany is german all students undertaking a german-taught program will need to be able to demonstrate a firm knowledge of the language either by means of a language test result or by taking a preparatory course accepted proficiency tests are the dsh german language university entrance examination for international applicants testdaf test of german as a foreign language gds goethe institut german language diploma and the dsd german language diploma of the standing conference of the minister of education and cultural affairs level ii if you are only studying in germany for one or two semesters you may not need to provide this evidence if you have a limited knowledge of german you could consider taking an english-language program there are a growing number of english-taught programs at universities in germany particularly at postgraduate level if you are a non-native english speaker you may be required to provide proof of your english-language proficiency with a toefl or ielts result if your chosen school requires this they will list proof of english-language proficiency as an entry requirement however even if you do study in germany in english it s advisable to learn the basics of the german language to enable you to communicate more effectively with the local residents admissions processes vary between institutions so

relationship with industry contacts and offer more opportunity for practical learning including internships if you wish to pursue an academic career on the other hand f achhochschulen may not be the best option as there is less focus on theoretical work and they do not award phds although tuition fees in germany are non-existent at public universities you still need to consider how you ll cover living costs if you don t have a sponsor or supporting family member there are countless opportunities to gain scholarships to cover these costs scholarships to study in germany can be obtained in several ways the german government offers some funding to international students through the daad or the european commission s erasmus+ scheme but many opportunities are offered independently by german universities or external funding bodies browse the funding options on your chosen university s website to see if they offer any international scholarships –these are often awarded based on merit subject of study and/or country of origin for a selection of general and subject-specific scholarships to study in germany see this list to learn more about the lifestyle student cities and the leading universities in germany take a look at the following resources guides articles blog posts unfortunately most german universities do not offer accommodation to enrolling students this means

in in big cities within western germany i.e dusseldorf cologne etc and smaller student-oriented cities such as heidelberg and freiburg you should expect to pay slightly more than if you were living in eastern germany i.e berlin when looking for accommodation in germany you should consider student residences shared accommodation or an apartment an unshared apartment is the most expensive choice and this will generally cost in the region of €357 ~us 320 a month shared accommodation would be cheaper at around €280 ~us 250 a month while student residences are cheaper yet again at around €234 ~us 210 a month if you struggle with finding accommodation you can also look for somewhere temporary to cover your first few days or weeks in the country in these instances emergency housing may be provided by the university or you could try couch-surfing staying in a hostel b b or hotel for more information on finding accommodation visit this article on the daad website you could also use the
