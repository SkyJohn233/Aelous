University of Charleston students can now prepare for careers in educating others on healthy lifestyles and disease prevention thanks to a new bachelor’s degree offering in health promotion. The health promotion major focuses on the understanding and promotion of health in populations. The program has a strong health science emphasis that provides students with a robust health care foundation, while also offering a complementary array of interdisciplinary coursework in natural sciences, psychology, education, and communication. “This degree has the potential to provide graduates with numerous career and graduate school options upon completion,” says Acting Health Promotion Program Director Janet Rorrer. “We look forward to the possibility of collaborating with community organizations and businesses on healthy living initiatives and placing our students in exciting and practical internships.” Students can graduate with a bachelor’s degree in health promotion from UC in just three and a half years. This includes a 12-credit internship during the final semester, which ensures graduates have the real-world tools to make an impact from the first day of employment. For more information on the health promotion program at UC, visit:  http://www.ucwv.edu/majors/HealthPromotion This February, an interdisciplinary student team from pharmacy, nursing, athletic training and other health professions from the University of Charleston are joining the national Script Your Future campaign to host a series of community outreach activities, raising awareness of the health consequences of not taking medication as directed. The UC students join with health professions students across the country in the 2014 Medication Adherence Team Challenge, conducting activities throughout the month, as part of a national effort to educate consumers on the importance of medication adherence. Last year, UC won the National Challenge Award from Script Your Future for creating 12 new and innovative activities and resources, reaching over 6,000 consumers in the Charleston, West Virginia community. Student pharmacists at the University of Charleston will engage in a number of activities aimed at increasing medication adherence in Charleston, the Kanawha Valley and the state as a whole. At the end of the Challenge, select schools or colleges will be recognized nationally for their efforts to improve medication adherence. In 2013, the 18th Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. Regina Benjamin, presented the student winners with their awards at a ceremony in Washington, DC. To learn more about the campaign, visit  http://www.ScriptYourFuture.org . The winners of the Challenge will be announced later this spring.
