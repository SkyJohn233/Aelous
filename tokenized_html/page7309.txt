niapattenlooks skincare and science my review of muas matte liquid eyeliner with photos and comparisons i think i ve found it the eyeliner i have a love/hate relationship with liquid liner it looks great my eyes look more open and awake it lasts much better than other eye makeup products the right liquid liner will not end up all smudged under your eyes turning you into gollum i get nice comments when i wear it- you look surprisingly well rested i have a small baby who finds sleep a boring waste of time appearing well rested takes some considerable effort at the moment i need all the help i can get on the other hand liquid liner is fiddly and time consuming it makes me want to throw things most of the liners i ve tried are either impossible to apply or come off too easily losing a wing while you re out and about is devastating i can t get on with pens either- the colour always lacks punch i ve done a post about liquid liner check it out and l oreal superliner came out tops but i m not wholeheartedly in love with it you have to dip the brush back in the pot way too many times but it does stay on well i don t know why i was looking at mua eyeliner i think i liked the packaging it comes in a matte black tube it looks good considering it s only £2 i did what i usually do in these situations- i drew a line on my hand let it dry then tried to smudge it off woah it doesn t budge let s take it for a test drive the nib is one of those short fat affairs it holds quite a lot of liner so no endless redipping it dries an intense matte black here s a little doodle to show you the finish- then i put the mua liner to the test here s how it performed against my other liners- i wrote the brand names in each corresponding liquid liner the products consist of kiko artist signature pen collection extreme pen l oreal superliner bourjois clubbing and mac liquifast the bourjois and mac were really difficult to write with apologies for the messiness then i took a wet wipe and gave them a good rub this is how they fared- only l oreal mac and mua matte still standing the rest are gone without a trace then i gave my hand a really good scrub- the mua and the mac remain pretty much unscathed what a difference i wouldn t necessarily recommend the mac liquidlast despite its good performance in the test it s a bugger to remove and it costs £16 the mua liner is as easy to use as a liner can be still a bit of a fiddle but then it always is it didn t make me want to hurl it across the room so that s good after a day s wear it s still present and correct come evening time and comes off pretty easily with makeup remover i thoroughly recommend mua matte liquid eyeliner it cost just £2 it lasts the colour is intense and it s easy to use i would say this is the best liner i ve ever tried hands down mua matte liquid eyeliner 10/10 available from superdrug my blog review of lancôme grandiose bendable liquid eyeliner july 28 2016 in beauty a review of liquid eyeliners on the market in the uk march 9 2016 in beauty how do do 1960 s inspired halloween cat makeup- tutorial and product list boots contacted me to be a part of their feline fierce campaign and as excited as i felt to be contacted by such a big brand i was nervous in equal measure after all i m knocking on the back door… october 14 2018 in beauty i love mua as a brand they aren t even the cheap and cheerful you would think of they are genuine quality i prefer pens but that s mostly because of my sight loss… but shall definitely check this out great review xxx thanks sassy i m in love with collection too for cheapness thanks for the comment xx i had this eyeliner hateddd it the applicator was too hard and the eyeliner dried too quickly on it x no way the applicator is firm i didn t find it dried up maybe they ve changed the formula sorry you didn t like lucky it s only £2 x maybe i got a bad one hahah x you should take it back i ve got a rubbish one sort it out bloody marvellous post – i m heading out to buy one love the hand-doodle test new-look/readability improved site is great too xxx thanks behind the bite great to hear x jesus loved your little test mind if i maybe use it in my next review here on my blog read about why my eyeliner is better than yours i don t mind if you include a link to my blog i fancy getting one of those angled brushes anything to make things easier x loved your test what an awesome way to see which eyeliners are the most durable without applying and cleaning your eyes over and over again i use coconut oil as a makeup remover so i wonder how that would do in removing this eyeliner i ve never heard of mua-i wonder if they ship to the states x bloggerclubuk thanks for the comment i reckon coconut oil would work really well unfortunately they don t ship to usa at the moment thanks for checking out my post x i m a huge fan of liquid eyeliner and for £2 i will definitely be giving this one a go i do worry a little about how i would get it off though i use baby wipes to remove make-up but i don t think they d touch this thanks for linking up to bloggerclubuk debbie it would come off with a baby wipe maybe just add a bit of oil to help it along thanks for the comment x this site uses akismet to reduce spam learn how your comment data is processed enter your email address to subscribe to this blog
