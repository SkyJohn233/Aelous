Everlane Is Letting You Choose What You Pay on Hundreds of Sale Styles, Including Cashmere Choose What You Pay,  Men  and  Women  | Everlane Everlane’s  Choose What You Pay section  (which, for the unindoctrinated, allows shoppers to choose from three different, discounted price points for an item) is always a good source of savings on some of the brand’s coveted, stylish basics, but it’s usually pretty limited.
