2011 Water Quality Report Login Renew my Membership    Join Us Today 90-day Free Trial We are pleased to bring you the 2011 Water Quality Initiative Report. Results show that generally water quality remains very good across our region, however there continues to be some areas of concern. Please take the time to read the update on water quality in your area. Volunteers monitored Calcium concentration in our lakes for the first time this year. Calcium is important because it supports the development of certain aquatic organisms that feed on algae. Without these organisms, the amount of algae in our lakes may increase even if nutrients do not. The 2011 results form a baseline against which we will be able to measure changes in the future. The MLA will be working with our technical advisors and volunteers over the coming year on some specific actions to improve water quality. Watch our website and newsletter for more news about these actions, or contact the office to find out how you can become involved.  Revision February 2012:  Following publication of our final report, a significant mapping error in the Area Summary for Muskoka Sands (MSN) was brought to our attention. Sites 6 and 7 in the original version have been changed to Sites 1 and 2 respectively in the revised version.  Should you have any questions regarding the error, please do not hesitate to contact the MLA office at  info@mla.on.ca Copyright © 2019 Muskoka Lakes Association.
