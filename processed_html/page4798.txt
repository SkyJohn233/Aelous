Horizon-2   Student Projects from Middle East and Africa In this project I aimed to facilitate human life in space. This two-stage spacecraft carries more than 300 people in two prefabricated capsules that can be used on the moon. Since the capsules are produced on Earth, they speed up the process of space colonization. Capsules include 3 manipulators that can be used to carru supplies and energy storages. As the capsules are left behind on the moon, the return process in easier, faster and safer than normal space travels. 3D model of Horizon-2 includes 1.624 bodies which took about 50 hours to model. Also some components have joints with each other so the movements of the doors and manipulators can be examined in Fusion 360.  All models, assemblies and renders were created with Fusion 360.
