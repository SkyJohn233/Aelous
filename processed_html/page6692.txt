MAI CHAU ECOHOUSE in the Pom Coong village | Northern Vietnam Mai Chau Ecohouse in the Pom Coong village. Vietnam offers a number of sites suitable for  eco-tourism  and exploring the traditional way of life of ethnic people.  Homestay , exploring local cultures and customs, trekking in nature, cycling, tasting a local cuisine and not just that. One of such places in northern Vietnam is the city and district of the same name  Mai Chau . This small town and nearby villages in the neighborhood where most of the  Thai ethnics  live, offers a host of homestay accommodations, mostly a wooden hut built on stilts. The popularity of this place is known and because it is located only about  180 km from Hanoi , it is often visited, especially in the season. There are even smaller villas here, but in the nearby villages there are practically just only the  challets (wooden stilt houses) . Almost all of them are quite similar and offer virtually the same services as others. Sales of textiles, fabrics and accessories (yes there is really a lot), cultural performances, local cuisine, cycling, etc  You can also take look how to create traditional multicolored fabrics or buy them. One of the nearest villages at  Mai Chau   Pom Coong  is located just about 1 km from the center of the town. This village is such a gateway to other homestay accommodations and huts, which are all prepared and tailored (accommodation, food, wifi, water ) for  tourists and travelers . One of the first thing to see if you come from the town is  Mai Chau Ecohouse  (Khách sạn Mai Châu Ecohouse), next to the tiny little school. Mai Chau Ecohouse  consists of 4 larger typical  stilt huts  and now even a  smaller hotel , which according to the owner s information was built only on the instigation of foreign travelers who are looking for comfort, in my opinion this hotel a little disturbs the countryside. But maybe I understand, if come some a bit older travelers or people, this hotel can be suitable for them. Relaxation in hammock in Mai Chau Ecohouse. In my opinion, Mai Chau Ecohouse is  well located , right at the beginning of the village of  Pom Coong , so you can easily walk to the small town of Mai Chau (about 1 km) over the  rice fields  that are really very nice in the harvest time. You can also watch the everyday life and hard work of local farmers and villagers in the rice fields, but they take it as a standard life, they re just used to it. Some people might have asked if there is a  hot water, food, wifi, electricity, toilets , etc   Yes, everything is here and also in the nearby villages and huts. Mai Chau is not like a remote place in Ha Giang (some real homestay need not have electricity), but in Mai Chau, there is really almost everything. I was here in December for 5 days and the all services worked fine. I would like to highlight a  very tasty and good dinner , in the price I think about  $ 5 per person (it can change), it was a meal for almost 2 people. It is also possible to buy a breakfast, but I did not use them. Mai Chau Ecohouse and huts for accommodation. In December  I was in this place for 5 days and I have to say, mainly during the night it was a quite cold, it is not a place in the mountains it lies in the valley. However, ecohouse offers hot blankets and  comfortable sleeping mats  in the huts. Even though I was wearing a sweatshirt and trousers, the temperatures fell below 10 degrees. There will be another situation in the summer months, it will probably be quite hot. The  price for 1 day  and dinner was about  $ 15 and I had the whole room in the challet for myself (about 8-bed room in the cottage), because it was not a seson and there were only a few tourists. Even in Mai Chau Ecohouse you can see  cultural performances/dances  of Thai ethnic groups, as well as another ethnic groups such as the Hmongs. You can see this show probably once a week, when some local  Thai people  from nearby villages come here to show you their dance creations and you can dance with them personally. Such performances are also held at other nearby challets and villages. View from one of the huts in Mai Chau Ecohouse. If you visit Mai Chau, I recommend to  stay here at least for a while  (2-3 days). Mai Chau is a small but a little bit more visited place (mainly in the season or weekend), but some villages still keeps their cultural and ethnic character. I recommend to  rent a motorbike or bicycle  and explore this area on your own. This place is on the route if you travel from Ninh Binh to Son La or vice versa or you will be traveling near the  Hoa Binh lake . Approximately 40 km from here in the direction of Son La there is another interesting place with ethnic Hmong villages  Moc Chau .
