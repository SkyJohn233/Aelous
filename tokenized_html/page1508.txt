an easier method for constructing the hierarchical micro-/nano-structures on the surface of dental implants in the clinic is needed in this study three different titanium surfaces with microscale grooves width 0.5 x02013 1 1 x02013 1.5 and 1.5 x02013 2 x003bc m and nanoscale nanoparticles diameter 20 x02013 30 30 x02013 50 and 50 x02013 100 nm respectively were obtained by treatment with different concentrations of hydrofluoric acid hf and at different etching times 1 3 min 0.5 12 min and 1.5 12 min respectively denoted as groups hf1 hf2 and hf3 the biological response to the three different titanium surfaces was evaluated by in vitro human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell hbmmsc experiments and in vivo animal experiments the results showed that cell adhesion proliferation alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization of hbmmscs were increased in the hf3 group after the different surface implants were inserted into the distal femurs of 40 rats the bone x02013 implant contact in groups hf1 hf2 and hf3 was 33.17 x000b1 2.2 33.82 x000b1 3.42 and 41.04 x000b1 3.08 respectively moreover the maximal pullout force in groups hf1 hf2 and hf3 was 57.92 x000b1 2.88 57.83 x000b1 4.09 and 67.44 x000b1 6.14 n respectively the results showed that group hf3 with large micron grooves 1.5 x02013 2.0 x003bc m and large nanoparticles 50 x02013 100 nm showed the best bio-functionality for the hbmmsc response and osseointegration in animal experiments compared with other groups current trends in dental implant therapy include the use of endosseous dental implant surfaces embellished with hierarchical micro-/nano-structures for effective and rapid osseointegration 1 2 first from the biomechanical perspective the micron-structured surface allows the modeling of bone elastic behavior 3 which can provide flow channels for fluid flow 4 enhance molecular and cellular transport and induce shear stresses via fluid drag at cell surfaces nano-structured surface allows cells to orient in the groove direction resulting in cytoskeleton alignment and cell rearrangement along the nanoscale guidance cue 5 second from the physical perspective micron-structured surface can increase bone x02013 implant contact bic which is identified by measuring the physical interaction between rough implants and bone in pushout or torque removal assays 6 7 nano-structured surface nanocrystals nanofibers nanocomposites etc can imitate the natural extracellular matrix ecm 8 9 and has been widely studied in the field of regenerative medicine third from the molecular perspective micron-structured surface may involve surface signaling hypothesis for osteogenesis 10 x02013 13 nano-structured surface contains nanoscale cell receptors/mechanosensors to microscale signal transducers because of nanoscale adhesion-localized structures 14 hierarchical micro-/nano-structures may lead to more balanced enhancement of multiple cell functions such as morphology migration adhesion proliferation and differentiation 15 16 furthermore from a biomimetic perspective a hierarchical micro-/nano-structure may provide a more suitable surface topography for cell functions as it can better mimic the structure of the bone tissues composed of nano- micro- and macroscale building blocks 17 various combinations of hierarchical micro-/nano-structured surfaces are typically composed of microstructures including micropits 18 micropillars and microgrooves 19 as well as nanostructures such as nanoleaves nanoplates nanorods nanowires nanotubes and nanoparticles 16 20 21 micropits and micropillars are typically arranged in an organized manner isotropic rather than an unorganized manner anisotropic on the microgrooves 22 it has been reported that the microscopic bone properties of cancellous and cortical bone enable them to be more suitable for use with the anisotropic surface for interlocking 23 nanoleaves may provide a larger contact area for adherent cells compared to nanoplates however the production process is complicated 20 nanorods are typically used to limit the contact area between cells and a nanorod-patterned surface to eliminate cell adhesion although stem cells can survive for long periods of time on surfaces sparsely coated with sio 2 nanowires their high energy consumption is a disadvantage 24 nanotubules are promising candidates as drug-delivery systems for increasing the amounts of calcium and phosphorous on the surfaces 25 among these nanostructures nanoparticles have been widely applied because of the following advantages increasing integrin molecule clustering to enhance adhesion facilitating matrix flow by forming interconnected microporous structures and enabling easy fabrication of dense nano-arrays 26 x02013 28 recently numerous approaches including physical biological optical and chemical methods have been employed to fabricate nanoparticles with titanium surfaces to improve bic 26 29 physical methods such as the compaction of tio 2 nanoparticles yield surfaces with nanoscale grain boundaries 30 which conserves the chemistry of the surface among different topographies but are limited to linear and isotropic materials biological methods such as molecular self-assembly involve the spontaneous chemisorption and vertical close-packed positioning of molecules osteoinductive or cell-adhesive molecule onto specific substrata however the bond strength may be weak optical methods such as lithography typically rely on wavelength-specific dimensions to achieve appropriate nanoscale modifications however the approach is labor-intensive and requires considerable development prior to clinical translation 31 chemical methods involving acid-etching peroxidation alkali treatment anodization and nanoparticle deposition such as sol x02013 gel colloidal particle adsorption can impart nanoparticles to the surface and display strong physical interactions at the atomic-scale level 32 among these chemical methods acid etching with hydrofluoric acid hf has been used to create hierarchical micro-/nano-structures because of its high efficiency simple operation high volume of production and incorporation of the osteogenic element fluoride ion onto surfaces 33 x02013 35 numerous studies have reported that titanium surfaces treated with hf exhibit irregular rough hierarchical micro-/nano-structures but most studies utilized the method to form microgrooves on titanium surfaces to provide a greater bonding surface area 36 x02013 38 previous studies revealed that variations in acid concentrations and immersion time significantly affected these structures 36 37 however no studies have analyzed the fine structures of hierarchical micro-/nano-structures on the titanium surface etched by hf literature review and preliminary experiments revealed that gradient scales of hierarchical micro-/nano-structures can be formed by precisely controlling the etching conditions thus it is significant to determine an optimized scale for hierarchical micro-/nano-structures on the implant surface using hf etching to improve osseointegration in this study we determined three gradient scales of hierarchical micro-/nano-structures on titanium surfaces obtained using different hf concentrations and etching times in vitro experiments were performed to evaluate the biological response of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells hbmmscs to these titanium surfaces in vivo experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of titanium implants with three gradient

different scales of micro-/nano-structures of the 36 experimental group samples the nanoparticle arrays were randomly organized over these substrates we screened gradient scales of nanoparticles in the range of 20 x02013 100 nm and respective gradient scales of micron grooves from 36 experimental groups we identified three groups with gradient scales of micro-/nano-structures etched by hf under three different etching conditions thus we screened three gradient scales of hierarchical micro-/nano-structures from small to large at different hf concentrations and etching times 1 3 min 0.5 12 min 1.5 12 min from 36 experimental group samples macroscopic surfaces figure 1a showed that hf treatment visibly affected the titanium surfaces in all etched groups based on the change in surface brightness of the disks from polished control group to dull gray etched groups according to the sem at a magnification of x000d7 5,000 four groups presented micron-level changes the polished group as a control group exhibited some parallel grooves in the same direction as polishing however the etched groups showed nonuniform grooves in inconsistent directions in addition the density of the micron grooves on the surface of the group hf3 decreased by more than that of the two etched groups the depth and width of the micron grooves on the surface of the group hf3 exhibited larger values than the former two etched groups the widths of micron grooves for the three etched groups were 0.5 x02013 1 1 x02013 1.5 and 1.5 x02013 2 x003bc m respectively at a magnification of x000d7 50,000 only three etched groups exhibited nanoscale changes the etched groups showed an irregular shape of nanoparticles distributed in an unordered manner the diameters of these nanoparticles in the three etched groups were 20 x02013 30 30 x02013 50 and 50 x02013 100 nm afm revealed that the hf1 groups had a dense and small particle-like structure the group hf2 showed deep and steep mountain-like structures the group hf3 showed relatively flat and larger hill-like structures the control group showed no nano-level changes surface wettability was measured by determining the water contact angles figure 1b the etched groups exhibited high hydrophilicity compared to the control group in addition among the three treated groups the group hf3 showed the highest hydrophilic properties because of its minimum contact angles table 1 moreover eds table 2 confirmed that the fluoride contents on the surfaces of treated groups were 1.23 1.17 and 1.30 respectively however there were no significant differences in the surfaces of these treated groups as shown in figure 2 a magnification of x000d7 1,000 revealed a clear morphological difference in hbmmscs on the different titanium plates the cells on the etched groups spread over larger areas compared to cells in the control group among these etched groups the group hf3 showed slightly larger spreading areas than the other two etched groups moreover the cellular pseudopod on the group hf3 was larger than for the other two etched groups the cytoskeleton morphology of hbmmscs attached to sample surfaces was observed after 6 h of culture figure 2 the clsm images showed hbmmscs stained with fitc-phalloidin to label the actin cytoskeleton a larger number of microfilaments and stress fibers thicker bundles of filaments were observed in the three etched groups strong labeling was frequently observed along the cellular edge and within the filopodia in the control group the cells were extended with many filopodia but few cellular junctions were observed and most cells did not exhibit a well-developed cytoskeleton the actin bundles exhibited frequent haphazard orientation and few long stress fibers were visible however cells on the etched surfaces were polygonous in shape with abundant long lamellipodia and filopodia forming good intercellular junctions between adjacent cells and exhibiting more stress fibers and actin microfilaments than those on the control in addition cells with flatter extensions and junctions were observed on the group hf3 the number of adherent cells on the titanium samples at the three time points 30 60 and 120 min of incubation is shown in figure 3a at each interval the number of adherent cells on the etched groups was clearly higher than that on the control groups interestingly in each etched group there was no difference in the number of adherent cells following incubation for 30 and 120 min while at 60 min the number of adherent cells on the surface of group hf3 was significantly higher than for the other etched groups figure 3b p x0003c 0.05 as shown in figure 4 alp production in hbmmscs on all substrates occurred as early as 1 week after incubation and increased over time there were significant differences in alp production between the control group and etched groups at each time point there were no obvious differences in alp production among the three etched groups ecm mineralization was assessed by alizarin red staining at 7 and 14 days the etched groups induced the formation of abundant mineralization nodules that were larger than those in the control group calcium deposition indicated that the ecm mineralization levels in the group hf3 were significantly higher than those in the other two groups the gene expression of hbmmscs on the titanium surfaces was quantified by real-time pcr as shown in figure 5 in general the gene expression in cells on the titanium surfaces was time-dependent after 3 days of incubation the runx2 alp and ocn showed the highest expression in the etched groups however runx2 expression was higher in hf3 compared to the other two etched groups after culturing for 7 days the etched groups yielded higher expression for all genes except for alp compared to the other surfaces gene expression in the group hf3 was maintained at a high level over time runx2 alp and ocn showed much higher expression in the etched groups than in the control group the implants were etched by hf under the etching conditions described for the titanium plates these implant surfaces exhibited gradient scales of hierarchical micro-/nano-structures as described figure 6a the implants and osseointegration of peri-implant trabecular bones were observed in the undecalcified sections with methylene blue/acid fuchsin staining calcified bone in the stained slides was distinguished from other tissues by its characteristic color figure 6a bone tissue was stained bright pink and the implant was stained black in the slides one section from each sample was used for analysis and the results of histomorphometry were expressed as bic figure 6b three months after implantation bic in the control group and groups hf1 hf2 and hf3 was 22.46 x000b1 1.98 33.17 x000b1 2.2 33.82 x000b1 3.42 and 41.04 x000b1 3.08 respectively table 3 there was a statistically significant difference in bic between the control group and other etched groups moreover the group hf3 showed a statistically higher bic compared to the other two etched groups groups hf1 and hf2 showed insignificant differences in bic figure 6c shows the results for testing of the maximal pullout force of the four groups 12 weeks after implantation the pullout forces of the etched groups were significantly higher than in the control groups p x0003c 0.05 in the three treated groups although there was no significant difference in the groups hf1 and hf2 the group hf3 showed the highest maximum pullout force micro-/nano-structures are widely thought to promote osseointegration at the micron level the structure of an implant surface can increase the contact surface between the bone and implant and thus the biomechanical interlocking between the bone and implant 39 at the nano-level a more textured surface structure increases surface energy high surface energy increases the wettability to blood as well as binding of fibrin and matrix proteins this condition favors cell attachment and tissue healing particularly immediately after implantation which is important in the osseointegration process 28 in this study three gradient scales of hierarchical micro-/nano-structures were obtained by hf etching with different acid concentrations and etching times micro-/nano-structures can be fabricated using additive methods and subtractive methods additive methods typically use templates fabricated through titanium plasma-spraying electron-beam lithography molecular self-assembly and sol x02013 gel transformation techniques among others these methods provide more complex micro-/nano-structures and drugs can be coated onto the surface such as the molecular self-assembly method 40 and sub-10 nm length scale structure can be achieved such as electron-beam lithography 41 subtractive methods typically use templates fabricated through blasting peroxidation h 2 o 2 or acid oxidation and acid etching 42 these methods are of particular interest because of the following advantages loading of osteogenic drug and antibacterial element on surface promotion of cell ingrowth through porous channel on surface and adsorption of amino acid molecules 43 in these subtractive methods hf etching is widely used for implant modification 44 a highly concentrated pure aqueous solution of hf was first prepared in 1809 and hydrogen fluoride was first obtained at the end of the 18th century 45 46 the major applications of aqueous hf are as household and industrial products in the medical field hf etching can be used to modify implant surfaces due to the following advantages first random and irregular micro-/nano-structures can be obtained using hf without deliberate manipulation 35 the reason for this can be explained as follows the etching in hf readily removes the natural oxide from the surface and dissolves titanium and generates ti ion and f ion ti ion can be further oxidized by atmospheric oxygen or can be complexed by f ion this treatment induces a micro rough surface due to the preferential dissolution of the alpha phase of the biphasic alloy by hf 35 considering the ti x02013 al x02013 v alloy the alpha phase rich in al is covered by a more efficient passivation film since both ti and al occur in its formation while the beta phase rich in v is passivated by a simple tio 2 film a localized corrosion at the grain boundary between the alpha phase and beta one can be noticed causing surface beta crystal detachment and pitting effect 35 hf etching does not cause any variation of the surface morphology and typical nanostructure is undamaged on the crests and on the valleys of the thread 47 second osteogenic fluorine elements can also be loaded onto the surface by bonding of oxygen and ti to form tifxoh which can modulate osteogenesis by upregulating the expression levels of genes such as runx2 and bsp 13 48 third aqueous hf is also highly efficient of low cost simple to use in industrialization and shows a good clinical effect 33 our results demonstrate that hf3 group became more hydrophilic and exhibited markedly improved wettability a better understanding of the surface roughness and structure of modified titanium surfaces is a basic requirement for the discussion of wettability 49 the high-magnification sem images figure 1a also showed that similar nanoparticles were distributed in each experimental group and that the nanoparticles of the largest sizes were distributed in hf3 group afm three-dimensional images figure 1a showed that the nanoparticles of the largest sizes were distributed in hf3 group which indicates the largest surface roughness on hf3 group this surface structure increases surface energy resulting in the good wettability with a similar tendency the contact angles of the hf3 group were lowest thus surface hydrophilicity influences the adsorption of cell adhesion proteins containing arg x02013 gly x02013 asp rgd sequences and thus enhances the adhesion and spreading of osteoblast precursors on implant surfaces 50 that is a good explanation for the results of hbmmscs adhesion we found that the hierarchical micro-/nano-structures with micron groove widths of 1.5 x02013 2 x003bc m and nanoparticle diameters of approximately 50 x02013 100 x003bc m showed better osteogenic activity than the other two etched groups these results can be explained as follows first from the micro perspective a wide groove is beneficial for cell adhesion and high resistance to implantation friction 47 cells on the flat part of the substrate spread randomly while in the grooved part the cells are elongated it has been reported that the lamellipodia of cell edges preferentially adhere to the floor of 2.1 x003bc m-wide grooves 5 second from the nano perspective previous studies have shown that cell adhesion requires nanoscale adhesion-localized nanoparticles that change in response to integrin clustering 51 filopodia are fine structures their adhesion to a material surface depends on the increased density of nanoparticles at focal adhesion sites supporting evidence for our hypothesis is that if individual rgd ligands of adhesion-related particles were present at a density of 70 nm apart similarly to nanoparticles at a diameter of 70 nm mscs preferred to gather more individual integrins on the surface into mature adhesions 51 shen et al demonstrated that the spreading proliferation and differentiation of mscs could be greatly improved by hierarchical structures with large nanoparticles 80 nm at the cellular and molecular levels 27 there were some limitations to our study first it was difficult to avoid chemical effects induced by fluorine ion during modification of a titanium surface with hf however we found that the fluorine content was equivalent in the three etched groups second although osteogenic activity of the titanium surface was evaluated in vitro using hbmmscs and in vivo using rats effects of this surface must be evaluated in humans third three selected groups with gradient scales of hierarchical micro-/nano-structures and other etched groups may require further evaluation in addition fatigue resistance and corrosion resistance were not evaluated after hf etching further characterizations of the disks and screw should be performed and the mechanism underlying cell behavior changes on the three gradient micro-/nano-structure surfaces requires further analysis in summary three gradient scales of hierarchical micro-/nano-structures on titanium surfaces were obtained by hf treatment with different acid concentrations and etching times hierarchical micro-/nano-structures with large micron grooves 1.5 x02013 2 x003bc m and nanoparticles 50 x02013 100 nm enhanced cell behavior in vitro and promoted osteogenic activity in vivo indicating promise in clinical applications this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china number 81371186 and
