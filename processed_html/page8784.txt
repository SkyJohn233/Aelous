f(x)=g(x)+5 then on any interval [a,b] the area of the region between the graphs of f and g is? | Yahoo Answers If for all real numbers x, f(x) = g(x) + 5, then on any interval [a,b] the area of the region between the graphs of f and g is? 5 [ b - a ] The difference between f and g is f-g = (g+5)-g = 5, a constant.  Thus, the area is the same as a rectangle:  length*width = (b-a)*5. More formally: integral(f-g from a to b) =  integral(f from a to b)-integral(g from a to b) =  integral(g+5 from a to b) - integral(g from a to b) =  integral(g from a to b) + integral(5 from a to b) - integral(g from a to b) = 5*(b-a).
