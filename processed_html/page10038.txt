High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), or Sprint Interval Training (SIT) has a payoff like few other exercise programs. That s why it s at the core of popular workouts like P90X and CrossFit, and ranked No. 1 overall in the Worldwide Survey of Fitness Trends for 2018. Whether you re doing burpees or running sprints, this workout (which involves maximal effort exercise for 20 to 40 seconds, and then rest, in repetition) has no rival for burning off fat, while sculpting lean muscle   as well as boosting your endurance, coordination, and glucose metabolism. First developed for famed British middle distance runner Sebastian Coe back in the Seventies, it s quick, convenient, and there s no equipment required. I love it,  says local fitness enthusiast Sue Telfer.  It s not that stressful on your body, but it allows your heart rate to pick up. It s great for both gym rats wanting an extreme workout, and newcomers   allowing them to feel that high intensity for brief periods of time.  That energy level translates into making you feel good. Now, you re going to train harder. You re going to increase the intensity level of the workout,  she continues.  HIIT is going to make you feel better, and (losing weight is a fringe benefit of that). It s amazing,  agrees retired schoolteacher Steve Bator, who does HIIT three times a week for 22 minutes on a stationary bike   starting with  bursts  of 30 seconds, and building up to 90 seconds.  It feels like it completely restores you. You feel invigorated. It releases endorphins. LvlUP Athletics, in Clarkson, offers HIIT primarily through its regular  Tabata  classes   where you do 20 seconds on, rest for 10 seconds, and do eight repetitions, totaling four minutes.  The class we do is 45 minutes, with stretching at the end,  explains owner/trainer Sophie Allard.  There are different ways of doing it. Some people just do cardio, others do lunges the entire time, or bicep curls. You pick one exercise for four minutes. HIIT Training, for us it s good because we do smaller groups. When you get larger groups, you sort of lose the thread. And, it s more fun for clients to participate in a cardio (class), than just running on a treadmill. Plus, it s All Ages. We have a 65-year-old lady who does a class. We ve got newbies, and kids. I once did it with a broken foot,  she adds. While most everyone will enjoy the rush that comes with HIIT training, the real  jackpot is you continue to shed calories well after the workout -- due to the  after-burn effect , known as Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption.  This means you can knock off an early morning workout, then keep burning off calories while you re at the office! However HIIT, is not without its share of controversy.  While it will build up their stamina, some researchers question whether the average person can safely handle the more extreme nature of these workouts. A red flag popped up in 2012, when the Canadian Armed Forces issued a general order asking its personnel not to do HIIT Training, because it can be tied to a rare condition called  exertional rhabdomolysis , which can lead to severe kidney damage, even death. This condition sees the breakdown of skeletal muscle from extreme unaccustomed physical exertion. Symptoms include muscle pain, weakness, swelling, and dark, tea-coloured urine. But again this is rare. And by and large, the research indicates that with proper precautions HIIT is a safe, effective, and fun way to exercise. Experts advise new arrivals to start slowly and build up their HIIT workout over time, under the guidance of a professional trainer. Bator suggests that before attempting it,  You should develop some level of endurance, and definitely get checked out by your doctor for blood work, and a stress test.
