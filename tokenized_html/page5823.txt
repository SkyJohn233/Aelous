rubbish bags with cat litter are 'too heavy gazette colchester 7Â°c heavy bin bag refuse collectors have refused to pick up black bags because they are too heavy danny francis said for the second time his black bin bags have not been collected a note left on two out of three bags from the council says the reason was because the bags were too heavy mr francis of gilberd road colchester said the bags were weighty because they contained cat litter he added we recycle as much as we can and what can t be recycled goes in the black bags for normal bin collection the council website does not state any maximum weight his weighed his bags after coming home from work to find two of them still in the garden which were between 11kg and 17kg each he added i wondered how they were too heavy as my wife was able to lift them three bags have now been left to fester and create a health hazard subsequently i have had to dispose of these bags myself despite contacting the council on two occasions still nothing has been done the extra weight is due to the amount of cat litter we have to use for one of our cats who is seriously ill and uses the litter more frequently the council website states it is fine to dispose of cat litter in black bags yet they refuse to take them we try to spread the weight between the bags if my wife can t lift the bags then we reduce the weight a colchester council spokesman said there was not a weight limit but added it is more of a health and safety issue he said whilst cat litter is not recyclable and should go in black bags our advice remains to pet owners to please remember our collection crews backs and try not to make each bag too heavy given the sheer volume of waste material they encounter with crews on a black bag route lifting around 100,000kg each day our operatives are instructed as a matter of safety not to handle items which they consider too heavy to throw into the back of a refuse lorry we will be happy to return to collect the waste if the resident can reduce the weight of each bag last updated 31st december 1969 4:00 pm are you sure you want to delete this comment get involved with the news in your community this website and associated newspapers adhere to the independent press standards organisation 's editors code of practice if you have a complaint about the editorial content which relates to inaccuracy or intrusion then please contact the editor here if you are dissatisfied with the response provided you can contact ipso here copyright 2001-2019 this site is part of newsquest 's audited local newspaper network a gannett company newsquest media group ltd loudwater mill station road high wycombe buckinghamshire hp10 9ty 01676637 registered in england wales please be aware we use cookies and similar technologies to help our site work to understand how it is used and to personalise content and advertising it helps us continue to provide access to our content for free by clicking accept you agree to allow cookies to be placed you can manage your settings here and get more information via our privacy notice
