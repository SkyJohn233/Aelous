the average real rate of return of common stock ask an economist to define the real rate of return on common stock and chances are he will say the percentage gained or lost after adjusting earnings for inflation the rates of return on common stock and other investment products calculated by accounting solely for inflation are temporary earnings the judicious investor knows beyond the cutting reality of inflation lies brokerage fees and management expenses which eat into earnings lowering the real rate of return retained furthermore at the end of the tax year income zipped off to uncle sam 's coffers in the form of capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends negate additional gains due to the unpredictability of short-term views of the stock market analyzing one-year returns on common stock provides little in the way of beneficial insight to the average investor volatility in the markets at its most extreme can be easily understood by looking at the inflation-adjusted real rate of return for 1862 a whopping 66.6 percent and comparing that with the real return in 1931 a devastatingly dismal -38.6 percent based on isolated 12-month periods the rate of return varies from -12 percent to a positive 24 percent according to jeremy j. siegel finance professor at university of pennsylvania s wharton school in an august 2011 publication thornburg investment management based in santa fe new mexico cites returns based on the s p 500 index from the end of 1980 to the end of 2010 a 100 investment on december 31 1980 returned a nominal 10.71 percent through the end of 2010 real return at 5.23 percent after subtracting taxes expenses and inflation is less than half the nominal rate looked at in actual dollars gained makes the disparity evident the original 100 invested grows to 2,119 using only nominal return however once allowances are made for trading and management expenses inflation adjustment and taxes the real return becomes 462 the figures quoted above use earnings solely from the large-cap stocks indexed by the s p 500 small-cap stocks in the russell 2000 earned a real return of 4.97 percent over the same 30 years nominal return for russell 2000 small-caps was 10.04 percent nominal return on international stocks that mirror the msci eafe index was 9.70 percent with a real return of 4.54 percent held for the long term stocks earn more wealth for investors

san francisco chronicle and zacks among others the rate of return on an investment is the value of the investment plus gains the investment made throughout a given time period expressed as a fraction of the initial investment amount the realized rate of return more commonly referred to as the real rate of return are the gains the investment made offset by its losses and adjusted for inflation while the rate of return shows you the percentage of net gains you ll make for an investment in proportion to the investment cost the realized rate of return also accounts for inflation and other losses in making the calculation investors often use the terms rate of return and return on investment interchangeably calculating the rate of return is a simple way for investors to determine how much money their investments have earned since the time of purchase the most simple equation for calculating the rate of return is initial investment amount plus gains made from the investment minus costs divided by the cost of the investment at the time of purchase investors also calculate the rate of return to determine how long it will take the investment to earn back or return the initial principal investment amount consider an example in which you paid 10,000 for an investment that returned 1,000 in its first year at the end of the year your total investment value is 11,000 your rate of return is 11,000 10,000 10,000 or 10 percent at this rate of return it would take your investment 10 years to earn back your initial investment of 10,000 10,000 1,000 10 years if the same 10,000 investment returned 800 per year your rate of return is 10,800 10,000 10,000 8 percent in this case it would take your investment 12 years and six months to earn back your initial investment 10,000 800 12.5 years the realized rate of return employs the same financial concepts of the rate of return and but it also makes an adjustment for the dollar-depreciating nature of inflation consider the same 10,000 investment that earns 1,000 in the first year for a 10 percent rate of return factor an inflation rate of 3 percent your real rate of return is 7 percent with a real rate of return of 7 percent your yearly gain is 700 in this case it would take approximately 14 years and four months to earn back your initial principal investment of 10,000 to adjust for losses when calculating the rate of return and realized rate of return subtract the investment s losses from its gains in the example of the 10,000 investment at the end of year one your realized rate of return is 7 percent if you were to cash out your investment at the end of year one you would pocket an additional 700 on top of your 10,000 initial investment at the beginning of year two your investment is worth 10,700 at the end of year two your investment incurs losses of 500 and its value has dropped to 10,200 your realized rate of return drops to 2 percent sue-lynn carty has over five years experience as both a
