help authenticating win7 to ldap server ars technica openforum welcome to the ars openforum i have my nifty new synology box and i was hoping to make use of some of its non-storage features such as the built in ldap server but it is n't working quite how i expected from researching things ahead of time i know* i can not bind my win7 machines to the ldap domain but i was under the impression that i could still create users in ldap and then log in to the win7 machines with those credentials but i 'm running into some issues firstly since my win7 machines are not part of a domain just in a workgroup the user login screen does n't allow for users to do anything other than pick a local account i 've found methods to change this via the registry or through policy editor but that seems a bit hoop jumpy secondly i was hoping i could add ldap uses to the local administrators group on computer but the ldap domain is n't showing up as a searchable location just the local machine am i missing something likely and probably obvious this is all pretty new to me as opposed to the already built ad networks i grew up in the reason i 'm messing with all of this primarily is that we 'll be using the nas for our primary file share and would like to have some more granular security on the contained folders so would be using the standard windows acl stuff i think this would be far easier to control and maintain if it was based of ldap rather than just the local accounts on each users laptop sure if i do n't change anything users can connect to the share but they 'll then be prompted for different credentials than what they are logged in to their laptop with i 'd like to consolidate all that if i can so users to bring the hate you need samba4 for what you want to do so your pc can join the domain this guy has done just that but it 's pretty far into hacking territory also at least as of last year synology has turned off acl support in smb.conf so there 's no windows acl support actually as of about 4 minutes ago i got part of this working using a 3rd party authentication software called pgina i can now log in to my test laptop with a ldap user and based on that user 's ldap group memberships add the user into local groups ie i made a windowsadmin ldap group and pgina is configured to make any members of that group members of the local machine 's administrators group at login so i can log in/out now i just need to play around with how this works with share authentication but obviously i 'm still open to 'better ways of doing this or hearing what anyone has to say about pgina synology 's ldap ldap in general as used with windows etc ars technica 1998-2019 powered by phpbb and ars openforum powered by server central 2019 cond nast all rights reserved use of this
