biosorption of cu ii and pb ii ions from aqueous solution by natural spider silk sciencedirect sciencedirect aside from its excellent mechanical properties spider silk ss would offer an active surface for heavy metal interaction due to its rich protein structure the present study describes the potential use of natural ss as a sorbent of heavy metals from aqueous solutions single and multi-species biosorption experiments of heavy metals by natural ss were conducted using batch and column experiments the biosorption kinetics in general was found to follow the second-order rate expression and the experimental equilibrium biosorption data fitted reasonably well to freundlich isotherm from the freundlich isotherm the biosorption capacities of cu ii and pb ii ions onto ss were found as 0.20 and 0.007 mmol g –1 respectively the results showed a decrease in the extent of metal ion uptake with lowering the ph ► application of ss as a biomaterial for heavy metal biosorption was proposed ► ss can be used for preconcentration of environmental samples even at acidic medium ► sorption kinetics of the ss is fast enough and it is easily applied for column experiments ► the sorption capacities compete well with biomasses reported the potential risks of heavy metal pollution on the bio-environment have evoked intensive investigations over the past decade the quality control of drinking water is a topic of high relevance which is receiving a worldwide continuously growing consideration by institutions and research laboratories one of the popular techniques for the determination of heavy metal ions in water samples is the solid phase extraction zhang et al. 2006 soylak et al. 2003 the method is distinguished by its simplicity and rapidity in comparison with the other conventional techniques such as solvent extraction synthetic and natural sorbents have been used as solid phase extractor for the preconcentration and separation of heavy metal ions fu and wang 2011 kosobucki et al. 2008 tehrani et al. 2006 in addition biosorbents serve as effective and inexpensive support materials for solid phase extraction studies ofomaja et al. 2010 baytak and turker 2005 godlewska-zyłkiewicz 2004 biosorption refers to the ability of certain biomaterials to bind and concentrate heavy metals from even the most dilute aqueous solutions carvalho et al. 2001 demir and arisoy 2007 esposito et al. 2001 hawari and mulligan 2006 various biomaterials produced or harvested from natural resources or agricultural products mostly in metabolically inactive states have been used in the preconcentration or mainly for disposal of heavy metal effluents by biosorption these include microorganisms and lignocellulose biomaterials such as peat moss raw rice bran rice straw coconut husks waste coffee powder dried plant leaves etc cain et al. 2008 oliveira et al. 2005 orhan and buyukgungor 1993 among these biomaterials marine algae and peat moss have been studied extensively to remove heavy metals from contaminated effluents zümriye 1997 brown et al. 2000 however besides a strong metallic affinity the search for easily available sorbents has led to the investigation of materials of agricultural origin as potential metal sorbents pagnanelli et al. 2001 sheth and soni 2004 spiders spin silks from proteins secreted in specialized abdominal glands that vary in number and morphology across species the spider silk ss known as one of the strongest natural materials with a high toughness is a natural polymer made of repeated amino acid pattern and its primary structure the amino acid sequence has been optimized over millions of years as a result of biological evolution it is reported that the amino acid sequences of two different fibrous proteins fibroins build up the natural silk fibers seidel et al. 1998 the studies on the ss are generally focused on their excellent mechanical properties and gene sequence of natural ss rising et al. 2005 hayashi et al. 1999 recombinant ss lazaris et al. 2002 or synthetic ss fahnestock and bedzyk 1997 the rich amino acid structure of the natural ss provides great complexing ability metal coordination of the conh group in small peptides may occur through either carbonyl oxygen or deprotonated amide nitrogen depending on ph provided the metal is initially coordinated by the terminal amino group due to the unique physical properties and high temperature resistance natural ss can serve as a strong adsorbent even at rigorous conditions ss provides an easily obtained and non-hazardous material for heavy metal enrichment prior to their determination however no data is available about the heavy metal biosorption of the ss yet in the present paper the possible application of ss as a biomaterial for heavy metal biosorption for preconcentration purposes was proposed for the first time the ss samples were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy sem fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo gravimetric analysis tga and zeta meter the morphological analyses were carried out by using a philips xl30 sfeg and micro tech polar 10 sputter coater prior to sem analysis the samples were coated with gold particles functional groups of ss were identified by ftir analysis ftir measurement of ss treated with 3.0 m hcl was made using perkin elmer pyris ftir spectrophotometer with a pike miracle zirconium attenuated total reflection accessory in the spectral region 650–4000 cm −1 the zeta potential of ss was measured using a zeta meter 3.0+ zeta meter inc. equipped with a microprocessor unit having molybdenum anode and platinum cathode the unit automatically calculates the electrophoretic mobility of the particles and converts it to the zeta potential a sample of 0.01 g of the sorbent was placed in 50.0 ml distilled water and an aliquot taken from to measure the zeta potential the average of 15 measurements was taken to represent the measured potential the applied voltage during the measurements was generally varied in the range of 20–70 mv thermal decomposition study of ss was carried out by using perkin elmer diamond tg/dta analyzer a flame atomic absorption spectrometer faas varian 220 ss equipped with air–acetylene flame was used for the determination of cadmium 228.8 nm chromium 357.9 nm copper 324.8 nm and lead 217.0 nm under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric icp-ms measurements were performed by agilent 7500ce ph adjustment and measurements were made by using wtw 330i ph meter heidolph rotamax 120 shaker was used in batch experiments ismatec reglo analog 2/12 peristaltic pump and tygon 07 mhll i.d 1.14 mm tubing were utilized for the propulsion of the carrier stream for column experiments all reagents used were of analytical grade all solutions were prepared with ultra pure water 18.2 mω cm −1 obtained from a millipore milli-q gradient water purification system analytical grade nitrate salts of metal ions namely cd ii cr iii cu ii pb ii were used to prepare stock solutions with a concentration of 1000 mg l −1 the sample solutions were then prepared at the required concentrations by serial dilution with ultra pure water prior to the addition of the sorbent the ph of the solutions was adjusted to be in the range of 1.0–6.0 by the addition of either 0.1 m hclo 4 or 0.1 m naoh natural ss samples of pholcus species were collected from local area after washing thoroughly with distilled water the ss samples were treated with 50 ml 3 m hcl in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min for the removal of any organic and metallic impurities already adsorbed on the material this process was repeated twice to ensure the elimination of any impurities on the ss samples the silk was then filtered and washed with ultrapure water to remove the acid and was dried at room temperature batch experiments were carried out in a 100 ml screw capped plastic bottle placed on a roller operating at a speed of 50 rpm at ambient temperatures for this purpose 100 mg of the ss was added into 20 ml of the solution at the required ph after a certain contact time the suspension was filtered and the metallic ion content was analyzed by icp-ms. desorption studied were carried out in 20 ml of 0.2 m hcl solutions and the metal ion content was determined by either faas or icp-ms. desorption efficiency was calculated in terms of amount of the released metal ions as the percentage of total amount of metal ions sorbed by the silk in the column studies 0.2500 g of ss was mixed with pvc dust particle size 0.25 mm at 5 m/m for the ease of flow the mixture was tightly packed into a 15 cm glass body column 5 mm i.d. another column was also prepared for controlling any biosorption tendency of the metal ions studied on the supporting material a 2-stop tygon mhll tubing was used to connect the outlet and inlet tips of the column to a peristaltic pump preset on a flow rate of 1.0 ml min −1 the biosorption percentage was calculated as follows where c 0 and c 1 are the metal concentrations in the sample solution before and after treatment respectively 1 biosorption percentage c 0 c 1 c 0 × 100 biosorption percentage c 0 c 1 c 0 × 100 typical sem images of ss samples as collected together with those rinsed with water and those treated with 3 m hcl solutions can be seen in fig 1 a–c several other acids were tested and it was observed that nitric acid has badly affected the fibers of the silk therefore further studies were conducted with 3 m hcl treated ss samples fig 1 characterization of the ss samples a–c sem images of untreated and treated ss samples with b water and c 3 m hcl 20,000× and d ftir spectrum of the latter and e the change of zeta potential with ph ftir spectrum of ss contains various bands related to different chemical and structural features of the ss protein fig 1 d the bands at 707 1233 1516 and 1633 cm −1 are characteristics of amide groups of amino acids the peaks at 1030 cm −1 can be attributed either to the backbone stretching of polyglycine structure and or hydroxyproline c–o stretching coupled with bending vibrations in the helical structure of ss protein the ftir spectrum also displayed strong peaks at 3288 and 1051 cm −1 both attributed to the presence of hydroxyl groups and probably to the serine content of ss protein the zeta potential measurements fig 1 e were carried out as a function of ph and the pzc of the sorbent was determined in the acidic range 1.0 ph 2.3 positive values of zeta potential are observed for the protonated sorbent i.e nh 3 –chrcooh the zeta potential becomes zero at ph 2.3 and then the sorbent displays a negative charge at higher phs as expected high temperature resistance of the ss samples were proven by the tga analysis and no decomposition was observed until 200 °c the ph of the solution has a significant effect on the heavy metal uptake since it controls the extent of surface protonation of the sorbent and the degree of ionization the ph adjustments are usually preferred by adding either hclo 4 or naoh solutions for avoiding any interaction with metal ions for ease of use the optimal phs were determined by using columns and 25 ml aliquots of mixed standard solutions 0.4 mg l −1 were pumped through the columns then the concentration of the metal ions in the outlet stream was measured by means of icp-ms fig 2 shows that very high biosorption percentages were obtained at ph 3 media for the metal ions studied this coincides with the pzc values being 2.3 similar results have been obtained for complexation of metal ions with functional groups of amino acids liang and yang 2010 in acidic media ph 2.3 the active sites of the sorbent such as carboxyl and amine groups are protonated and therefore no complexation was observed when the ph was above 2.3 the carboxyl groups become negatively charged and the amino group would carry a partial positive charge metal ions can approach to these groups and subsequently protons could be released by the amino groups further experiments were carried out at ph 5.0 fig 2 variation of cd ii cr iii cu ii and pb ii metal ion sorption on the ss as a function of ph biosorption affinities of the metal ions were also determined for multi-species biosorption systems with column process for this purpose ss and pvc columns were conditioned with a solution having ph of 5.0 and was then loaded with a standard solution mixture of metal ions cd ii cu ii cr iii and pb ii prepared at a relatively high concentration 5.0 mg l −1 10 ml aliquots of the metal solution collected from the outlet of the columns were analyzed and the metal ion concentrations obtained were used for the calculation of biosorption percentages as described above these calculated values were plotted against the loading volume of mixed standard solution fig 3 the dynamic biosorption selectivity of the ss for heavy metals was in the order cu ii pb ii ≫ cd ii cr iii interpreting the overall data the neutral complex of cr iii ion with acetate ac crac 3 at the given ph results in low affinity values as the ss shows higher affinities for cu ii and pb ii ions further experiments were focused on their biosorption characteristics fig 3 sorption percentages of 5.0 mg/l of cd ii cr iii cu ii and pb ii ions in ○ pvc and ● ss column at ph 5.0 and 1 ml min −1 flow rate the effect of ss dose on cu ii and pb ii biosorption was investigated with batch experiments the results showed an increase in the extent of biosorption of cu ii and pb ii ions as the ss amount increases until the dosage reaches up to 0.06 g sorbent the increase in biosorption is rationalized by the increase in available surface area of the sorbent as illustrated in fig 4 a the optimum sorbent dosages that can be used for cu ii and pb ii biosorption are 0.04 and 0.06 g respectively in addition a higher biosorption percentage 99 was obtained for copper compared to that of lead 95 fig 4 effect of a sorbent dose on the sorption of cu ii and pb ii ions for both ions at adsorption time 24 h b contact time on the sorption of cu ii and pb ii ions on 0.0100 g of ss cu ii pb ii 1.0 mg l −1 20 ml solution t 25 °c ph 5 the effect of the agitation time on the biosorption efficiency is shown in fig 4 b according to the figure cu ii and pb ii ions appear to reach the biosorption equilibrium in about 30 min of contact with the sorbent which implies fast biosorption steps and reflects ease of accessibility of the sorbate ions to biosorption sites in order to determine the rate the order and the rate constant of sorption three kinetic models namely pseudo-first-order lagergren 1898 pseudo-second-order ho and mckay 1998a ho and mckay 1998b ho and mckay 1999 ho and mckay 2000 and weber and morris 1963 models were tested the pseudo-first-order rate equation is given as lagergren 1898 ho and mckay 1998a ho and mckay 1998b 2 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where q t and q e are the amounts of metal ions sorbed mg g −1 at a time t and at equilibrium respectively and k 1 is the rate constant min −1 the pseudo-second-order kinetic model has the following form ho and mckay 1998a ho and mckay 1998b ho and mckay 1999 ho and mckay 2000 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k 2 g mg −1 min −1 is the rate constant the pseudo second-order kinetic model requires a rate-limiting step which may consist of chemisorption and the diffusion processes ho and mckay 1999 to elucidate whether the sorption process is controlled by bulk diffusion or intraparticle diffusion the weber and morris eq 4 was utilized the model is expressed as follows weber and morris 1963 kumar et al. 2009 4 q t k ip t 1 2 q t k ip t 1 2 where k ip is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant according to this model if sorption of a solute is controlled by the intraparticle diffusion process the plot of q t versus t 1/2 gives a straight line the kinetic experimental data and the constants related to above equations are summarized in fig 5 and table 1 respectively according to the results the pseudo-second-order model correlated better with the experimental data which is reflected by the higher correlation coefficients r 2 0.9998 and 0.9999 for cu ii and pb ii respectively in comparison to those of the pseudo-first-order kinetic model r 2 0.8630 and 0.8399 for cu ii and pb ii respectively and the weber and morris model r 2 0.4940 and 0.3318 for cu ii and pb ii respectively fig 5 a pseudo-first-order b pseudo-second-order and c weber and morris model fitting to kinetics of the metal sorption by the ss table 1 the sorption kinetic parameters for the three kinetic models the reasons for the rate-limiting step required for the model include external mass transport across the boundary layer surrounding the particle and diffusional mass transfer within the internal structure of the sorbent matrix by the surface or a pore or a branched pore and sorption at surface sites such as chemisorption or physical sorption ho and mckay 1998b considering the morphology of the sorbent the extent of the sorption is expected to be controlled by the bulk diffusion external mass transport there are four sequential steps in the sorption of metals onto porous and granular media 1 diffusion through a bulk solution 2 film diffusion 3 intraparticle diffusion and 4 sorption onto a solid surface kumar et al. 2009 if intraparticle or pore diffusion is involved in the sorption of metals the relationship between the sorbed amount of metals and square root of time would be linear however as shown in fig 5 c and table 1 the rate-limiting step is not governed by pore diffusion as the relationship for cu ii and pb ii was not linear this suggest that the main-limiting step is likely the biosorption onto the solid surface for the sorption of cu ii and pb ii on the ss for pb ii and cu ii distinctly differed regions are observed in the plots the first part may be governed by the initial intraparticle transport of metals controlled by the surface diffusion process while the next part may be controlled by pore diffusion kumar et al. 2009 sorption capacity of the ss for cu ii and pb ii were calculated from the pseudo-second-order model being 18.87 mg g −1 0.30 mmol g −1 and 2.53 mg g −1 0.012 mmol g −1 respectively an equilibrium sorption isotherm describes the interactive behavior between the metal ion and the sorbent over a given range of concentrations at a certain temperature in this study two of the most commonly used isotherm equations have been employed namely the freundlich and langmuir equilibrium isotherms the freundlich expression is basically an empirical model which is based on sorption onto a heterogeneous surface the linearized form of the freundlich isotherm freundlich 1906 is given by eq 5 5 log q e log k f 1 n log c e log q e log k f 1 n log c e where q e mg g −1 is the amount of cu ii or pb ii sorbed per unit weight of ss at equilibrium c e mg l −1 is the equilibrium liquid concentration of cu ii or pb ii ions k f mg g −1 is a constant related with sorption capacity and 1/ n is the freundlich constant indicating sorption intensity and linearity according to isotherm theory sorption conditions can be considered favorable if the 1/ n value is higher than 1 langmuir equation initially derived from kinetic considerations was based on the assumption that there are a definite and energetically equivalent number of sorption sites on the sorbent surface the binding of sorbates to the sorption sites can be either chemical or physical but it must be sufficiently strong to prevent displacement of sorbates on neighboring sites dąbrowski 2001 the most widely used linearized form of langmuir equation langmuir 1916 is rendered as eq 6 6 c e q e c e q 1 qb c e q e c e q 1 qb where q mg g −1 is the maximum sorption at monolayer c e mg l −1 is the equilibrium concentration of cu ii or pb ii q e mg g −1 is the amount of cu ii or pb ii sorbed per unit weight of ss at equilibrium concentration the langmuir constant b ml mg −1 is related to the affinity of binding sites and is related to the energy of sorption the obtained results of the freundlich and langmuir isotherm fits are given in table 2 from the freundlich isotherm sorption capacities of the ss were found as 12.73 mg g −1 0.20 mmol g −1 for cu ii and 1.39 mg g −1 0.007 mmol g −1 for pb ii these values are comparable with the capacity values given above and calculated from the pseudo-second-order model table 2 sorption constants for the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the change of ph with biosorption was monitored by column biosorption process the column extraction process was utilized for handling the samples with larger volume at closed system for achieving higher concentration factors and for combining the proposed methodology to a suitable detection system individual standard solutions of cu ii and pb ii 20.0 mg l −1 in ph 5 at unbuffered media were loaded to ss column at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min −1 and the metal ion concentrations in the effluent were determined fig 6 shows the post-column concentration profile of cu ii and pb ii ions versus the loading volume of standard solutions with initial concentration of 20.0 mg l −1 as can be seen in the figure the sharp rise in the concentration coincides to the decrease in the medium ph fig 6 changes in ph and concentration as a function of loading volume for cu ii and pb ii solutions during the sorption on the ss column as each metal ion solution is propelled through the column the sorption progressed comprehensively but not completely therefore the metal ion exchange with the hydrogen ions continues and the ph of the effluent reaches at ph 4.0 with very small increase desorption of heavy metal ions from the loaded ss with 0.2 m of hcl solution was performed with batch experiment after known concentrations of metal ions were loaded to ss at optimal ph contact time and dosage spider silk rinsed with ultrapure water it was noted that all of the heavy metals sorbed on the ss could be desorbed easily by solution for one minute contact time with almost 100 efficiency the rapidness of the process suggests that h has a higher competitive capacity than the heavy metal ions under low ph condition ss can serve as an interesting biosorbent for cu ii and pb ii ions the amount of metal ions sorbed depends on the sorbent dosage contact time and ph the decrease in the ph of the solution shows that the ss having a large number of acidic functional groups at the surface the biosorption percentages were found maximum at ph 3 the experimental data fitted well with the freundlich isotherm since the sorption kinetics of the ss is fast enough it is easily applied for column experiments further studies will include the results of preconcentration of heavy metals in ss packed column and their subsequent determination with a suitable transducer this study was supported by tubitak and ege university scientific research project
