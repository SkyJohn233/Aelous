I tried remove all my node_modules files and reinstalled again. I did ng clean too. But no luck. ERROR in Can't resolve all parameters for provideLocationStrategy in F:/On-Going Code/MGM/MGMWeb/node_modules/@angular/router/src/router_module.d.ts: ([object Object], ?, [object Object]).

It seems like you are missing an import somewhere. Is it working correctly when not doing a prod build or serving? @deebloo   yes my code is working correctly when I doing ng build or ng serve.  I am able to run the code properly. The time I get error is when I do ng build --prod. Attached please find screenshot for the ng serve. @NgModule ({ declarations: [ ], imports: [ ], providers: [ { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }], bootstrap: [] }) @deebloo   here is my app.module.ts file. I generated my angular app with ng cli version 1.0.0-beta.28. When I try to execute  ng build --prod  I'm getting this error: @papaiatis  I get the error for the project in which I am using providers: [ { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }] . Are you using the same in your project ? Sorry, my bad. I changed the "version" in angular-cli.json because, I though it is my application's version. Any update I am still facing the same issue. Some module was giving error. I  removed and check each module which was giving an error. Had the same problem, turned out a class was written as an ' @Injectable ()' but was used as a normal class. Therefore the builder crashed during optimising (I guess). This issue has been automatically locked due to inactivity. Please file a new issue if you are encountering a similar or related problem.
