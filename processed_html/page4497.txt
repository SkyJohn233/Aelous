Zombie Trap | Plants vs. Zombies Wiki | Fandom Zombie Trap  is the twentieth and last  mini-game  in the  Nintendo DSiWare  version of  Plants vs. Zombies . To win the level, the player must trap 35  zombies  in seven cages by using brains as bait.  When Zombie Trap is displayed on the mini-games menu,  Crazy Dave  will tell the player their record for the greatest number of zombies the player caught at once.  Bungee Zombies  sometimes drop zombies right in front of your house, but fortunately, they can still attract them with the brains before they go inside.
