mac unable to switch between speaker and headphone outputs steinberg support when using cubase or other steinberg asio hosts with one of the latest mac models it is not possible to switch between the built-in speaker and the headphones on the fly by simply connecting a headphone in the host two built-in audio options are available instead of the previous one the latest mac models from 2018 contain a built-in audio sub-system that is different from prior intel hda high definition audio architecture in macs built-in audio functions are handled by a new component so that the built-in audio hardware is now 'looking different to audio apps running on the system among other things it provides an independent built-in speaker and headphone output selection as a feature which can not be used correctly by our asio hosts at the moment until we come up with a permanent solution we suggest to create an aggregate device in the audio midi setup applications utilities see this link for details the newly created aggregate device can then be selected in cubase/nuendo under studio ▸ studio setup ▸ vst audio system ▸ asio driver 0 comments article is closed for comments
