Annick Goutal is the eponymous fragrance line founded by Annick Goutal in 1981. A model and former pianist, she discovered her passion for perfume while procuring fragrance for a facial cream she was creating. It soon overtook her, and she gave up her modeling career and studied perfumery instead. She was inspired by her daughter Camille, who she trained to be a world-class perfumer in her own right. Although Goutal passed away in 1999, Camille Goutal continues to run her mother’s business.  All products are original, authentic name brands. We do not sell knockoffs or imitations.

She went into the skin cream business with a friend and instinctively felt they were missing two things, fragrance and packaging. Read more about  Annick Goutal Fantastic store!
