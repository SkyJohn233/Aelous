For the third year in a row, Hi-Wire Brewing will be releasing 10W-40 Imperial Stout (8% ABV) brewed with coffee, chocolate, and vanilla. With notes of dark chocolate, fresh vanilla, and roasted coffee beans, this big decadent stout is full-bodied, sweet, and creamy with a smooth finish. From Asheville’s own French Broad Chocolates, the cocoa nibs are fresh and rounded out by milk sugar and Madagascar vanilla beans. Organic Dynamite Roasting Company coffee accentuates the cocoa and adds slight roast to balance out the vanilla in this pastry stout. 10W-40 will be available in 4-packs of 16 oz cans and will see limited distribution beginning November 17th at the brewery’s Stout Bout Beer Festival at their Big Top Production Facility.

Available in 4-packs of 16oz cans, this beer will see limited distribution beginning Friday, November 9th. Hi-Wire Brewing will be releasing Peach Sour from their Sour  &  Wild Ale program on Saturday, November 24th at 12pm from both of their taprooms.
