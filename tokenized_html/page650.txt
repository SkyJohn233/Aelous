differences from the beta to the finished version katawashoujo this post made me curious about the differences from the beta to the finished game can someone maybe list the major differences between the the first draft and the final script in the beta shizune x27 s path is completely different it really diverges around act 3 while on its own it is better than what x27 s in the game it doesn x27 t match the tone of everything else so it x27 s pretty clear why it got cut read it if you have the time know that it is much more more depressing than what is in the final product emi x27 s art is of significantly lower quality no real objections to what they changed there i don x27 t know much though about how her route changed hanako x27 s route involves a slightly more crazy and desperate hanako what made it into the final product is a lot more believable even if it is less interesting in a way tl dr shizune x27 s path changed the most i x27 d suggest reading it there are minor differences everywhere else but i don x27 t think they are that major for most of the changes i heard about it x27 s quite graspable why they changed shizune x27 s path for example is hellishly depressing in the final game once you step back and consider what you can infer about shizune x27 s character from the incomplete information given hell if i x27 d need someone to make that worse x27 i x27 m sorta curious too although i think at the same time i do not want to know ah well difficult ya i wan na know everything there is to know about ks but at the same time i seeing how it became what it is makes me think i will lose some of my immersion so i had to curiosity got the better of me read up about the shizune beta story i agree with kevinturnermovie that it really didn x27 t fit the tone of the game and now that i got the intelligent part of this post out of the way strong class= _12fooeddl7j_rgmqn0sneu what the strong i can x27 t even cry about this my brain is not done processing the mix of feelings of just how horrible that is versus how it wasn x27 t the actual final version and for good reason was not sued and my favourite character in the game and and then that x27 s the good ending and then in the bad ending and fuck it if that had been in the final game considering i had shizune x27 s bad ending the first time i played i would have stopped i mean it i found it difficult enough to go on as is after lots of crying over the bad ending but that beta script wow *breathes* ofc i realize it only appears this horrible to me because i contextualize it against the current game trying to change the story of the current characters as presented in the game and as evolving with in the game to the beta x27 s plot so in other words i reckon if i had played that in the final game it would probably have had strong class= _12fooeddl7j_rgmqn0sneu less strong emotional impact on me but still since my brain can x27 t help interpret it with the characters i know from the release wow fuck but disregarding the emotional stuff i think the final shizune version is better adding emotions the other one would simply not have fit horrible as it was i can see why they changed it it wouldn x27 t have worked it was definitely built to be an emotional pit of a script but it wasn x27 t relateable no one knows anyone who had this happen to them katawa shoujo x27 s strength is how easily the girls their demons and hisao x27 s weaknesses reflect in us or the people we know shizune x27 s beta script didn x27 t work like that it was a tragedy in 4 acts one worse than the other but it was just that a tragedy to quote emi these things happen it would have made me sad to read but i doubt it would have shaken me with emotions like her final script does.
