limits differential calculus siyavula we think you are located in south africa is this correct we use this information to present the correct curriculum and to personalise content to better meet the needs of our users calculus is one of the central branches of mathematics and was developed from algebra and geometry it is built on the concept of limits which will be discussed in this chapter calculus consists of two related ideas differential calculus and integral calculus we will only be dealing with differential calculus in this chapter and will explore how it can be used to solve optimisation problems and finding rates of change zeno born about 490 bc was a philosopher of southern italy who is famous for his paradoxes a paradox is a statement that seems contradictory and yet may be true one of zeno 's paradoxes can be summarised as achilles and a tortoise agree to a race but the tortoise is unhappy because achilles is very fast so the tortoise asks achilles for a head start achilles agrees to give the tortoise a \text 1 000 \text m head start does achilles overtake the tortoise to solve this problem we start by writing where achilles will overtake the tortoise when both of them have covered the same distance if we assume that achilles runs at \text 2 \text m.s -1 and the tortoise runs at \text 0,25 \text m.s -1 then this means that achilles will overtake the tortoise at a time calculated as however zeno looked at it as follows achilles takes t=\frac \text 1 000 \text m \text 2 \text m.s -1 \text 500 \text s to travel the \text 1 000 \text m head start that he gave the tortoise however in these \text 500 \text s the tortoise has travelled a further x \text 500 \text s \times \text 0,25 \text m.s -1 \text 125 \text m achilles then takes another t=\frac \text 125 \text m \text 2 \text m.s -1 \text 62,5 \text s to travel the \text 125 \text m in these \text 62,5 \text s the tortoise travels a further x \text 62,5 \text s \times \text 0,25 \text m.s -1 \text 15,625 \text m zeno saw that achilles would always get closer and closer but would n't actually overtake the tortoise so what does zeno achilles and the tortoise have to do with calculus consider our earlier studies of sequences and series we know that the sequence 0 \frac 1 2 \frac 2 3 \frac 3 4 \frac 4 5 \ldots\ can be defined by the expression t n =1-\frac 1 n and that the terms get closer to \text 1 as n\ gets larger similarly the sequence 1 \frac 1 2 \frac 1 3 \frac 1 4 \frac 1 5 \ldots\ can be defined by the expression t n =\frac 1 n and the terms get closer to \text 0 as n\ gets larger we have also seen that an infinite geometric series can have a finite sum where a\ is the first term of the series and r\ is the common ratio we see that there are some functions where the value of the function gets close to or approaches a certain value as the number of terms increases consider the function the numerator of the function can be factorised as then we can cancel the x+6\ from numerator and denominator and we are left with however we are only able to cancel the x+6\ term if x\ne -6\ if x=-6\ then the denominator becomes \text 0 and the function is not defined this means that the domain of the function does not include x=-6\ but we can examine what happens to the values for y\ as x\ gets closer to -\text 6 the list of values shows that as x\ gets closer to -\text 6 y\ gets closer and closer to -\text 8 x\ y=\frac \left x+6\right \left x-2\right x+6 -\text 9 -\text 11 -\text 8 -\text 10 -\text 7 -\text 9 -\text 6,5 -\text 8,5 -\text 6,4 -\text 8,4 -\text

-\text 5,6 -\text 7,6 -\text 5,5 -\text 7,5 -\text 5 -\text 7 -\text 4 -\text 6 -\text 3 -\text 5 the graph of this function is shown below the graph is a straight line with slope \text 1 and y\ -intercept -\text 2 but with a hole at x=-6\ as x\ approaches -\text 6 from the left the y\ -value approaches -\text 8 and as x\ approaches -\text 6 from the right the y\ -value approaches -\text 8 since the function approaches the same y\ -value from the left and from the right the limit exists we can now introduce new notation for the function y=\frac \left x+6\right \left x-2\right x+6 we can write this is read the limit of \frac \left x+6\right \left x-2\right x+6 as x\ tends to -\text 6 from both the left and the right is equal to -\text 8 if f\left x\right =x+1\ determine f\left -\text

\text 0,02 \right f\left \text 0,03 \right f\left \text 0,04 \right f\left \text 0,05 \right f\left \text 0,1 \right what do you notice about the value of f\left x\right as x\ gets closer and closer to \text 0 write the following using limit notation as x\ gets close to \text 1 the value of the function y=x+2\ approaches \text 3 this is written as this is illustrated in the diagram below we can also have the situation where a function tends to a different limit depending on whether x\ approaches from the left or the right as x\to 0\ from the left f x approaches -\text 2 as x\to 0\ from the right f x approaches \text 2 the limit for x\ approaching \text 0 from the left is and for x\ approaching \text 0 from the right where 0^ means x\ approaches zero from the left and 0^ means x\ approaches zero from the right therefore since f x does not approach the same value from both sides we can conclude that the limit as x\ tends to zero does not exist as x\ tends to \text 0 from the left the function approaches \text 2 and as x\ tends to \text 0 from the right the function approaches \text 2 since the function approaches the same value from both sides the limit as x\ tends to \text 0 exists and is equal to \text 2 video 28vg determine illustrate answers graphically we can not simplify further and there are no terms to cancel determine the following and illustrate the answer graphically factorise the numerator as x \to 10\ the denominator x 10 \to 0\ therefore the expression is not defined for x=10\ since division by zero is not permitted video 28ym sign up to get

function is not defined at x 4\ the limit as x\ tends to \text 4 does exist and is equal to \text 7 \begin align* \lim_ x \to 2 \left 3x+\dfrac 1 3x \right =6+\dfrac 1 6 \\ \frac 37 6 \end align* even though the function is not defined at h 0\ the limit as h\ tends to \text 0 does exist and is equal to \text 3 even though the function is not defined at h 1\ the limit as h\ tends to \text 1 does exist and is equal to \text 3 note that the function is not defined at x 3\ but the limit as x\ tends to \text 3 does exist and is equal to \frac \sqrt 3 6 average gradient in grade 11 we learnt that the average gradient between any two points on a curve is given by the gradient of the straight line that passes through both points we also looked at the gradient at a single point on a curve and saw that it was the gradient of the tangent to the curve at the given point in this section we learn how to determine the gradient of the tangent let us consider finding the gradient of a tangent t\ to a curve with equation y=f\left x\right at a given point p\ we know how to calculate the average gradient between two points on a curve but we need two points the problem now is that we only have one point namely p\ to get around the problem we first consider a secant a straight line that intersects a curve at two or more points to the curve that passes through point p\left x_ p y_ p \right and another point on the curve q \left x_ q y_ q \right where q\ is an arbitrary distance from p\ we can determine the average gradient of the curve between the two points if we let the x\ -coordinate of p\ be a\ then the y\ -coordinate is f\left a\right similarly if the x\ -coordinate of q\ is a h\ then the y\ -coordinate is f\left a h\right we can now calculate the average gradient as gradient at a point imagine that q\ moves along the curve getting closer and closer to p\ the secant line approaches the tangent line as its limiting position this means that the average gradient of the secant approaches the gradient of the tangent to the curve at p\ we see that as point q\ approaches point p\ h\ gets closer to \text 0 if point q\ lies on point p\ then h 0\ and the formula for average gradient is undefined we use our knowledge of limits to let h\ tend towards \text 0 to determine the gradient of the tangent to the curve at point p\ given g\left x\right =3 x 2 determine the gradient of the curve at the point x=-1\ we need to find the gradient of the curve at x=-1\ therefore we let a -1\ notice that we only take the limit once we have removed h\ from the denominator the gradient of the curve g\left x\right =3 x 2 at x=-1\ is -\text 6 given the function f\left x\right =2 x 2 -5x\ determine the gradient of the tangent to the curve at the point x=2\ we need to find the gradient of the tangent to the curve at x=2\ therefore we let a 2\ the gradient of the tangent to the curve f\left x\right =2 x 2 -5x\ at x=2\ is \text 3 determine the gradient of k x -x^ 3 2x 1\ at the point x=1\ let a 1\ the gradient of k x -x^ 3 2x 1\ at x=1\ is -\text 1 sign up to get a head start on bursary and career opportunities use siyavula practice to get the best marks possible given f x -x^ 2
