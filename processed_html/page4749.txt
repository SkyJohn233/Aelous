U of C head Elizabeth Cannon says $8.1M office upgrade needed | CBC News The University of Calgary &# x27;s president is defending the decision to spend millions of dollars to renovate her office and the space used by other executives. Students and faculty have criticized the  $8 million expenditure  on the administration building after deep provincial funding cuts. The U of C &# x27;s operating budget was slashed by $41 million and the capital budget by $6 million in March. But despite the cuts, president Elizabeth Cannon says the upgrades are necessary. “The money was in the university budget to be able to spend those dollars. In addition to the over $160 million we are spending on campus this year to upgrade classrooms and other student and faculty spaces. " The U of C &# x27;s board of governors approved the renovations last December, before the cuts came, Cannon added. “Absolutely did not impact the operating budget of the university, did not impact a student experience or impact the number of faculty or staff we have on campus. " Cannon made the comments at an event to announce a new multimillion-dollar donation to the University &# x27;s Haskayne School of Business.  With files from the CBC &# x27;s Kyle Bakx To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada &# x27;s online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).
