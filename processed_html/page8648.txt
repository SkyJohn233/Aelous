[–] IdRatherBeLurking 42 points 43 points 44 points 1 year ago (4 children) Not certain why anyone is surprised or disappointed- this has been the likely case since the announcement. [–] LostInTheVoid_ 62 points 63 points 64 points 1 year ago (2 children) Not surprised but I am still disappointed. [–] IdRatherBeLurking 12 points 13 points 14 points 1 year ago (1 child) I mean, we ' d all love 1-episode-per-chapter, but it ' s understandable that it ' s only 12 episodes for the first season. [–] Hwilkes32 18 points 19 points 20 points 1 year ago (0 children) This has been rumored to be multiple seasons too so not sure why it’d be a bad thing to get multiple 12 episode seasons [–] hasnain1720 4 points 5 points 6 points 1 year ago (0 children) yup [–] pandaaxul 39 points 40 points 41 points 1 year ago (5 children) Why are we here just to suffer  [–] N1ghtW1ng7 21 points 22 points 23 points 1 year ago (3 children) Everynight, I can feel character development.

Why they keep doin this stupid shit [–] naijaboy18 23 points 24 points 25 points 1 year ago (0 children) It’s actually the tv network and shueisha that have the  most say when deciding the episode count. Don’t blame pierrot for everything 🙄 [–] Z4K187 4 points 5 points 6 points 1 year ago (0 children) The studio doesn ' t decide the number of episodes. How many times does this have to be repeated here in this sub? [–] LostInTheVoid_ 82 points 83 points 84 points 1 year ago (3 children) GG no :Re  [–] Igaluk_7 11 points 12 points 13 points 1 year ago (0 children) Amazing  [–] MasterAdventZero [ S ] 7 points 8 points 9 points 1 year ago (0 children) Exactly [–] [deleted] 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago (0 children) Too soon, bro [–] Corstarkk 16 points 17 points 18 points 1 year ago (0 children) Well rip [–] BlackGoat240 44 points 45 points 46 points 1 year ago (2 children) We skipping character development and only look at the action scenes again? Tokyo Ghoul is a shounen anime [–] moon_sadness 8 points 9 points 10 points 1 year ago (1 child) Sadly, I think they will focus on that. [–] _KingCrimson_ 3 points 4 points 5 points 1 year ago (0 children) Funnily enough they rush the action scenes too.  [–] hasnain1720 10 points 11 points 12 points 1 year ago (0 children) Can ' t say im surprised lol [–] dixwins 10 points 11 points 12 points 1 year ago (0 children) well maybe this would work if they had 40 mins allocated per episode [–] WinterSoldier16 16 points 17 points 18 points 1 year ago (0 children) Well that effectively killed any hype I had for the anime. URGH.  [–] Bradythenarwhal 6 points 7 points 8 points 1 year ago (0 children) FeelsBadMan [–] ProteusXIII 5 points 6 points 7 points 1 year ago (1 child) Tf? The opening makes it seem like they’re planning on covering up to the Tsukiyama arc. just how much are they going to cut to be able to that??? [–] MasterAdventZero [ S ] 4 points 5 points 6 points 1 year ago (0 children) Seeing that it ' s adapting 5 Volumes.....A Lot of Content, Not Surprisingly  [–] SezyFazes 5 points 6 points 7 points 1 year ago (1 child) I hope this is an april fool joke :( [–] MasterAdventZero [ S ] 5 points 6 points 7 points 1 year ago (0 children) It ' s April 3rd, right now.....so unfortunately not even close....  [–] BornR3STLESS 4 points 5 points 6 points 1 year ago (0 children) This isn’t surprising whatsoever. In fact, doesn’t even feel like news.  [–] adri0907 12 points 13 points 14 points 1 year ago (1 child) They haven ' t understood yet that more than twelve episodes are required to adapt well all the stuff and emotions Tokyo Ghoul: re provides?! It looks obvious, isn ' t it? Tokyo Ghoul: re anime could be a real masterpiece and Pierrot studio will surely ruin it. [–] naijaboy18 8 points 9 points 10 points 1 year ago (0 children) And once again; people don’t realize that it’s the tv networks and manga publishers such as shueisha are the ones that decide whether it’s 12 or 24 episodes. Unless it’s an original in-house anime; studios don’t have as much say as people think. [–] Wahab12 9 points 10 points 11 points 1 year ago (0 children) Im crying rn  [–] phat_retard445 11 points 12 points 13 points 1 year ago (2 children) Chap 125 animated is all I want  [–] MasterAdventZero [ S ] 3 points 4 points 5 points 1 year ago (1 child) I doubt they ' ll do that [–] marinprofesorpreda 20 points 21 points 22 points 1 year ago (0 children) I doubt they ' ll do that I ' ll complain on the Internet if they don ' t [–] marinprofesorpreda 8 points 9 points 10 points 1 year ago (4 children) I don ' t get why that ' s disappointing, as long as they translate every panel into video and it only takes them 12 episodes and they don ' t miss anything important, what ' s the deal? Assuming they can get everything in, more episodes would just mean filler. Do you want to see Kaneki boil potatoes for a whole episode? I don ' t. [–] Megumin7 4 points 5 points 6 points 1 year ago (0 children) Judging from the opening, they will be adapting 50+ chapters. That ' s way too much for 12 episodes because they can ' t fit all the important details of these chapters into 12 episodes. Plus it will be pretty rushed. [–] MasterAdventZero [ S ] 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago (0 children) I would pay to see that [–] N1ghtW1ng7 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago (1 child) It’s not possible to fit all the important things into a 21 minuet per episode, 12 episode long series. The whole thing will have a runtime of roughly 4 hours and 20 minuets.  [–] marinprofesorpreda 5 points 6 points 7 points 1 year ago (0 children) You forget the manga isn ' t all talk, battle scenes go much faster in video than in manga and there ' s a LOT of battle. [–] dokkkanyeaze 3 points 4 points 5 points 1 year ago (0 children) Oh. [–] ImMainlyHereForTG 2 points 3 points 4 points 1 year ago (0 children) It baffels me how some are suprised about this. [–] Edgelord09 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago (0 children) Not surprised, wasn ' t even a bit hyped when they announced the anime, oh well atleast it will promote Tokyo ghoul to a wider audience. [–] xgameboyy 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago (0 children) : ' )))))))) [–] Kirito_Alsufi 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago (0 children) I don ' t think so I mean really this will barley touch the important things on the manga  [–] OneEyedKing_ 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago (2 children) They could have announced this on April fools. [–] MasterAdventZero [ S ] 2 points 3 points 4 points 1 year ago (1 child) They probably thought  " Let ' s screw them here and now, Muhahahaha... " [–] OneEyedKing_ 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago (0 children) After watching the first ep, they totally thought that. [–] lpopo4lyfe 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago (0 children) Well the disappointment begins. Tokyo Ghoul will never have a proper anime. Studio Pierrot gets the last laugh. When is Tokyo Ghoul: Root :Re coming? 😐 [–] newsNotice 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago (1 child) The opening showed stuff pretty later in the manga. RIP [–] MasterAdventZero [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago (0 children) Try explaining that to anime only viewers [–] LionelNaff [ &# x1F370; ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago (3 children) they ' re probably stopping at reaper Sasaki or before his reveal i think [–] NobushiAkira 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago (2 children) Hope not, that should at least be 24 eps [–] LionelNaff [ &# x1F370; ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago (1 child) it ' s in chapter 70 ish when reaper was revealed, no? if they ' re going 6 chapters an episode then we ' ll reach it. [–] NobushiAkira 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago (0 children) Welp I only hope every episode isn’t 6ch then haha  [–] SpideyAB 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago (1 child) pleasebebetterthanseason2 pleasebebetterthanseason2 pleasebebetterthanseason2 pleasebebetterthanseason2 pleasebebettertha.... [–] Majora-98 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago (0 children) That ' s not very hard to accomplish. [–] oredaoree 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago (0 children) I don ' t get the disappointment, are people thinking this is going to have an original ending and end :re with one cour? The first episode just came out lol They are probably not organized enough to do more than one cour at once and are playing it safe. There are a lot of factors at play such as budget, sponsors and working out TV schedules. I don ' t remember people being this antsy over the episode count when TG season 1 aired. [–] AnduinHellscream 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago (3 children) And then garbage like bnha and blaxk clover get 1-2chap/ episode, and actual good manga cant get proper adaptations... [–] MasterAdventZero [ S ] 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago (2 children) Dude, My Hero Academia was awesome [–] AnduinHellscream 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago (1 child) ye...no [–] MasterAdventZero [ S ] 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago (0 children) - hard slap in the face - Boi [–] FujinR4iJin 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago (0 children) So it ' s likely it will rush through the story, take a different path or wont even scratch the surface... [–] HydraBubble 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago (0 children) Tbh I ' m fine with how the whole first episode played out they wanted to get people hooked on the anime and they couldn ' t really do that until the fight with serpent it would have been kinda lame if they ended the first episode on the candy ghoul and i see people saying things like  " oh man re: ' s anime is gonna be rushed as fuck we saw a certain fight in the op when a lot of anime have things in the first opening not covered in the first arc / season for example fma:B steins ; gate guilty crown eureka 7 etc i ' ll hold out hope till they get to the fight in the the op then ill be mildly upset but i will still probably enjoy it for what it is unless they litterally take turns throwing up on it like they did with the animation in the shachi fight in root a [–] DGB_ 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago (0 children) Why god why god do i gotta suffer Posts are automatically archived after 6 months.
