dry skin that had sprung up on her children george two and isla nine months the retail assistant claims that despite trying a long list of lotions and creams breast milk is the only thing that has managed to calm their symptoms explaining how her husband ashley 29 a retail manager helped give the youngsters their weekly baths she said i would recommend it because it is a safe and easy way to help your baby s skin some people might be a bit squeamish about it but it is 100 per cent natural and we really enjoyed doing it. lizzie told how george arrived into the world perfectly healthy in december 2015 but when he was just a few weeks old she spotted some patches of dry skin on his stomach initially she tried to combat the problem – since confirmed as eczema which causes the skin to become red cracked and dry – with lotions and creams but none seemed to work so like many mums she turned to social media for advice i m in some mums groups and when i asked about it lots of members had tried breast milk baths and recommended them she explained my midwife suggested it too and when i was looking online it constantly came up in searches. then when george was eight weeks old lizzie washed him in breast milk for the first time it worked really quickly she said from there i did it weekly i found it gave him super soft skin every time i breastfed both kids and would express and freeze an extra supply for the baths i would use around 6oz 177ml a time just added to plain warm bath water and swirl it in turning the water a soft white colour occasionally i d add some lavender oil for a particularly relaxing bath at bedtime. lizzie turned to her breast milk to help with both of her babies eczema source pa real life then when her second child isla was born in september last year lizzie soon noticed the infant suffered with the same skin complaint as her brother having been breastfeeding her anyway the young mum immediately decided to start giving her baths too i did it weekly when isla was a newborn she said then as my milk supply decreased i started to do it every fortnight or so it really helped with her skin and i knew there were none of the harsh chemicals that can be in some bubble baths it s 100 per cent natural i also felt it was a nice way to continue with the breastfeeding journey it was a really special thing to share together. occasionally lizzie adds some lavender oil and flowers for a particularly relaxing bath at bedtime source pa real life as isla reached six months lizzie s milk supply began to drop and the tot had to be supplemented with formula feeds to ensure she got enough food unfortunately that led to the end of our breastfeeding journey said lizzie isla preferred the bottle and we tried everything like drinking more water drinking oat milk and eating lactation cookies which are filled with milk boosting ingredients like flaxseed and nuts – but we couldn t get my milk supply back up i had a little bit of frozen milk left and we were able to give her one last bath at the end of april i added some flowers for her last one and took some pictures so we could treasure the memories she loved them i think it was calming for her to be in my milk i always found her much more chilled after a milk bath than any other and i think helped with our bond – although she did try to eat the flowers on her last one. this is a
