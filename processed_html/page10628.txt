Carol Marine's Painting a Day: Casual Negligence As always love the brushstrokes. My son use to do parkour....and he would jump from one building to the next. These were flat roofs - one story building. Fortunately he was caught....but the little acrobatics could lead into bigger challenges.  I must say  " Eat Sleep and Paint! " Really very good painting and anyone will impress. Cheers :-)) Never. Gets. Old. xxoo
