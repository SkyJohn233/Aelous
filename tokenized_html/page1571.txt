occam 's razor tv tropes follow tv tropes http //tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/occamsrazor go to also called occam 's razor also listed by our good friends at rational wiki is an epistemological razor a logical principle that is used in deductive reasoning to evaluate theories it is named for the 14th-century franciscan friar and scholastic philosopher william of ockham who was a particularly assiduous applier and proponent of the law of parsimony although by no means the first to describe or postulate it it is often used to evaluate the usefulness of a theory its main tenet is that entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity it can be summed up with the phrase when you hear hoofbeats think horses not unicorns most theories have a foundation of underlying premises the aforementioned entities all of which need to be true for the theory itself to be true occam 's razor suggests believing the theory with the fewest underlying premises the aforementioned not multiplied beyond necessity example there have been theories that ancient astronauts built the egyptian pyramids instead of humans for this to be true we 'd need the following givens the more normal theory only requires that you can probably guess which theory occam would agree with and why in short when trying to examine an incident to figure out why it happened a simple answer involving the commonplace and reasonable is more likely to be correct note more likely not always for decades doctors presumed that people got stomach ulcers because of stress and bad diet as this was the simplest explanation at the time thus they encouraged people to reduce the conditions that caused them to be exposed to stress and to eat a bland diet then it was discovered that bacteria were the true cause of most stomach ulcers meaning stress and diet had little to do with whether or not you got an ulcer the previous treatments though reasonable were also wrong occam 's razor is the bane of conspiracy theorists everywhere since conspiracies usually rest on a lot of shaky assumptions for example the apollo moon landings which a good percentage in the single figures believe was hoaxed often people will find evidence that the landings could never have taken place but it rests on the arguments that the us government after that you 'd think that the simplest explanation was to you know actually send people there that mitchell and webb look has a brilliant series of sketches on this idea including the moon landing the razor is commonly misinterpreted as saying the simplest theory is the best. or even worse the simplest theory is always right. this is not correct in real life unless it is the simpler of two theories which make predictions with identical degrees of accuracy all other aspects of the theory have to be equal before simplicity is taken into account it also requires that all the data are accounted for newtonian physics are simpler than modern theories and were sufficient to take man to the moon but with all due respect to the man sir isaac simply could not explain all the data eventually collected especially since a lot of the offending material had not been collected when principia mathematica was published this required some other smart man namely albert einstein to formulate more complex theories particularly relativity note einstein explicitly made this point himself when he said that ideas should be kept as simple as possible but not simpler it should however be noted that since einsteinian physics make very little difference to results at macroscopic scales or with objects travelling at non-relativistic speeds and often the difference they do make is so small as to amount to false precision based on the initial variables the razor would still support using the newtonian equations for such calculations which is why we do so another very common mistake is to summon up the razor in a debate over a point that is entirely moot in order to add weight to a particular argument this usage is entirely fallacious as the razor does nothing more than recommend the hypothesis that makes the fewest new assumptions it is not a magical tool that points to the right answer in a lab it will be used hundreds or thousands of times with each and every one of the chosen hypothesis being rigorously tested before a correct answer is found in a debate the razor will be used once and will invariably choose the user 's answer as the 'right one funny that another problem thrown up in such situations is the scramble to determine whose theory is simplest and thus which one benefits from the application of the razor unfortunately thinking that occam 's razor is a magic tool for finding the right answer is not restricted to online debates it is also an altogether too common reason for medical misdiagnosis while not every condition is worthy of dr. house who actually declared occam 's razor to be a fallacy the whole point of his department was to handle weird cases where the simple answer already failed doctors have something of a tendency to default to the most likely diagnosis and may ignore evidence to the contrary particularly if they are tired or busy this means that doctors sometimes refuse to diagnose or even look for diseases such as meningitis sometimes with deadly results always remember occam 's razor is a guideline not a rule be careful of facts that are subjective in nature or may not be fully established the inverse of this is arkham 's razor where the most bizarre solution is most likely to be the correct one
