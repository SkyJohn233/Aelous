The second group is through Roll 20. My problem is that the maps are all on PDF and I can´t copy and put them in Roll 20! I have got by on the maps made by other people all the way up to Maiden, Mother, Crone but the very nice man who made them stopped making them at this point! Is there a way to take maps from a pdf and put them on roll 20? Or has someone else been nice enough to make maps somewhere online for Maiden, Mother, Crone? I really don´t relish the idea of having to draw the frankly massive maiden, mother and crone dungeons free style on roll 20! Thanks. It's a subject that comes up every once in a while on these boards. You can find a few threads with the forum search. Here is one that may help you. Thanks! It seems it´s not just me with this problem. I was trying to use them off the Interactive Maps that ironically are far less interactive than the ones in the adventure pdf. Thanks again.
