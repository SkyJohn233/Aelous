Rihanna fans tell Chris Brown to  ' back off '  as he comments on Instagram | Metro News 135.6 m  shares Chris Brown has openly spoken about his attack on his ex girlfriend Rihanna. However, despite him admitting to assaulting the popstar, he is still trying to win her over by commenting sweet nothings (or something like that) on her Instagram. The Umbrella songstress took to the social media site to promote a sale on her lingerie line for  Black Friday . Sharing a picture of her wearing some red Fenty pants, she wrote in the caption: ‘We getting NAUGHTY-not-NICE this season! ‘@savagexfenty just dropped The Ultimate Gift Guide to help you shop gifts for everybody in ya life !! Hit up SavageX.com to get 50% off everything for a limited time!’ The 30-year-old could be seen sprawled out on a bed while she matched her underwear with some black stockings and heels. And as fans commented on how ‘amazing’ she looked, Chris also snatched up the opportunity to share his thoughts too. Writing in the comments, he shared a little ’embarrassed’ emoji face – and fans were sent into meltdown. Rihanna’s followers were quick to call the singer out, and told the 29-year-old to ‘back off.’ One wrote: ‘why would @chrisbrownofficial do that?’ Another added: ‘He want that old thang back.’ Someone else questioned: ‘@chrisbrownofficial what are you doing here still?’ In 2009, the With You singer was found guilty of felony assault after he physically assaulted Rihanna on the night before the Grammys. A picture obtained by TMZ showing Rihanna’s facial injuries stunned the world, with the incident ending Chris’s career for several years (although he somehow made a chart comeback). In his documentary Chris Brown: Welcome to My Life the singer claimed that at the Clive Davis pre-Grammys party, a woman that he had sex with prior to his and Rihanna’s relationship showed up to the same party, upsetting Riri.
