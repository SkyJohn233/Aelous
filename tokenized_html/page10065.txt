go too trendy or out there the idea of a bright blue or hot pink garage door might excite you but flash-forward a year or two and think about how you ll feel will you still love the bright color or will you wish you d chosen something a little tamer over-the-top bold colors can also have an adverse effect on the value and curb appeal of your home you want people to be impressed by your color schemes not wondering what was he/she thinking do feel free to choose more than one accent color no rule says you must choose one main color and one accent color for the exterior of your home having two or three accent colors that all work together might be the better option for example you might have trim that s a cream color and a garage door that s a deep chocolate brown don t make your garage the focal point even if you want to draw attention to your garage door you don t want it to be the feature people are drawn to when they come up to your house it s better to call the most attention to your front door and hope that garage door is a nice complement not the star of the show do stick to one color like an overly bright bold color painting your garage door more than one color can date it and turn off potential buyers if you re stuck between two colors it s better to pick the most complementary or coordinating shade don t match your front door to the garage door since you typically want the front door to be the showstopper and attention-grabber of your home s exterior it s best not to choose a garage door that s the same color as your front door you especially want to pick a different color for the garage if your front door is a bright and bold color like purple or red if you re not replacing an older garage door but want to breathe new life into a tired or dated garage one option is to paint the door sometimes a fresh coat of paint is all it takes to update a garage door that was previously looking shabby and worse for wear painting a garage door does require a bit of prep and planning it isn t the type of project you can wake up and start suddenly depending on drying time it might take an entire weekend for you to paint a two-car garage door the material of your door might influence the type of paint you use on it usually an exterior latex paint is appropriate for either metal or wooden garage doors depending on the age or condition of an aluminum door you might need to strip the paint off entirely deep clean the door and prime and paint it if rubbing the door gently leaves a trail of powder on your palm you should consider stripping the paint then adding new coats of primer and paint certain seasons and weather conditions are best suited for painting outdoors if it s going to be very humid or if rain is in the forecast forget about painting that day not only will it be an unpleasant experience but it will take forever for the paint to dry between coats the ideal temperature for painting your garage door is 75 degrees or cooler but warmer than 50 degrees humidity should be low too it s also a good idea to either paint in an area that doesn t get direct sunlight or to wait until the sun isn t shining directly on your garage door a cloudy but warm day is just right since you might wake up to a rainstorm or a surprise heatwave on the day you d planned on painting it s a good idea to allow for some wiggle room in your plans don t put off painting your garage door until the weekend before an open house for example preparing your garage door before you paint does two things first it helps the new paint adhere to the surface better so that it s less likely to chip or peel off also it helps the new paint last longer even if you re not thoroughly stripping the door of paint before you begin you ll still want to give it a good cleaning use a wire brush or scrubber to scrape away any rust spots or chipping paint if your door is wood you ll want to sand it down to remove any unevenness before you paint once blemishes are gone and the surface of the door is smooth give it a cleaning you can use an all-purpose spray or soap and water to wipe down the door afterwards rinse it off with a hose or with a clean wet towel let the door dry completely before you move on tape off any areas you aren t going to paint such the trim and handles before you start painting if the door has glass windows add tape around their borders to keep the glass clean how you paint the door itself depends on its style if your door has inset panels the rectangles you often see on garage doors you ll want to use a brush to paint those first you can then paint the raised areas known as the stiles with a roller brush here s a quick rundown of the steps that will typically be involved in painting a garage door keep in mind that if your garage door is flat or doesn t have any paneling you use just use a paint roller and paint it like you would a wall apply the paint using w or m strokes making sure to dip the roller in the paint tray as it dries out you might also consider spray-painting your garage door which can make the project move more quickly figuring out how to use the sprayer to create an even coat can be tricky though if you re not sure of your painting abilities it s probably better to stick with the good old paint brush and roller usually you won t need to buy a great deal of paint if you re only painting a garage door even if you end up needing two or three coats of paint to cover up a dark color underneath one gallon of paint and a gallon container of primer should be sufficient if you re ready to give your
