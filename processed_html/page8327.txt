Current Resident : &# xA0; Old Greenwich is an incredible community  &# x2014; the absolute best in Connecticut. Safe, picturesque with highly regarded schools, Old Greenwich is an absolute treasure for those raising a family.

Real estate in town tends to range from $1.5M to around $8M making it a very expensive place to live, however, the personal and family-oriented benefits entirely outweigh the costs.

Getting to the nearest highway Can be problematic as there is always traffic on the road leading to the highway.  Otherwise, A wonderful place to raise a family Read  55 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I moved to Weatogue two years ago from Central Jersey. When my husband was medically retired from the military we wanted a nice quiet place to raise our 5 kids in a great neighborhood with a great school district. We found the perfect home where two houses down is the townline of Avon and Weatogue. It ' s perfect enough to feel like you ' re taking a walk through the woods yet down the road there is a strip of restaurants, shopping centers and walk-in clinics. My husband is 80% disabled and the thought of loud noises can be overwhelming for him. Here, in Weatogue, my backyard is a wooded area where we see wildlife from our kitchen window. You wouldn ' t even know there ' s a busy road a half mile away. I ' m very thankful to have moved here! Read  4 Reviews Parent : &# xA0; My parents and my husband ' s parents were also born in the town of Greenwich so we have deep roots here.  We have family throughout the town and I love raising my kids near their cousins and grandparents.  We enjoy what the town has to offer in the way of sports and leisure activities.  The downside is that it is expensive to live here and many people have lots of money. Read  6 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; The schools are excellent! Staples High School is a great school and colleges know that! This is the reason I moved here and it was worth it. The beach is very pretty, although after 13 years I &# x2019;m not as excited by it! There is a mix of people... some nice and some spoiled/arrogant, so find your people. The town is safe, people leave their doors unlocked (although I never would). Main Street is fun and the restaurants are pretty good. Overall, I moved here for the kids and it was worth it. Now that I &# x2019;m getting older, I &# x2019;m ready to live in a place that &# x2019;s warm all year! Read  38 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; New Canaan is an amazing community driven town with things to do for everyone!  The volunteer opportunities are boundless and offer ways for everyone to get involved and make everyone feel they can be a part of an amazing community.  There are many family focused, elderly focused, new resident focused, child  &  teen focused activities and one doesn ' t have to look far to become involved.  The schools are top notch; the public places are beautifully maintained; the library  &  YMCA are top notch, town parks  &  pool are beautiful; there are art exhibits, parades, gatherings, pop up parks, broadway like shows at the high school, amazing restaurants and shops in the walkable downtown district and truly something for everyone! Read  33 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Simsbury is a great small suburban town located north of Hartford. Simsbury offers great local businesses, as well as very fun daily activities. With the Farmington river running straight through the town, many water activities such as paddle boarding, kayaking, canoeing, etc. are very popular. Simsbury also has a very strong public school system, and is ranked very highly among the nations schools. Read  69 Reviews Former Resident : &# xA0; Ridgefield is an upper middle class town in Fairfield County. Living in a town like Ridgefield comes with many positives. World class school system, a safe town center with little to no crime. Also the convenience to lower Westchester and New York City makes Ridgefield a very desirable place to live. Ridgefield is a family town, so to be single in Ridgefield is not that enjoyable. Ridgefield falls in line with surrounding towns such as New Canaan, Wilton and Westport. As you could imagine your bank account needs to fall in line as well. The pressures of wealth and status does not escape you in Ridgefield even though Ridgefield seems to be a more well rounded town. Ridgefield may give the effect of being snobby and pretentious but hey its Connecticut! Read  106 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; The best place to live in CT - coming froma lifelong CT resident. Upscale town, dead center of CT.  Great things to do in your backyard. Outstanding restaurants- you will have your dining standards lifted when you dine out in WeHa. Great schools - our public schools are like the private schools of others.  Town services, people, everything. A great town for a family! Town is well run, and your property holds its value. Only complaint is the taxes, but with taxes comes exclusivity. Keeps the bar of entry a bit higher - and the quality of residents higher as well. Read  147 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; It ' s a quiet town with what seems to be a lot of wealthy residents in the area. One thing that is clear though is that the public high school - Greenwich High school - is a very well developed structure in this area. The school is bigger than most and has a diverse set of classes and faculty that really does help with the student ' s growth. There ' s so many classes that a student can choose from that it could honestly be said that the school caters to everyone ' s needs. Read  1 Review Current Resident : &# xA0; I moved from the Lake Hills section of Fairfield to Southport about 13 years ago, and I love it here! There is a great sense of community and it feels like you are back in time when you enter the Southport Historic District. Everything is walking or biking distance away, which is a great plus. The restaurant scene is very nice with the Artisan and the Gray Goose representing the posh side of Southport. Southport cares a lot about the environment and nature, with Southport Park being a great little destination, and there is an ecological restoration taking place east of Pease Ave, South of Mill Hill Terrace, and north of I-95. Read  1 Review Current Resident : &# xA0; Awesome community!  Community is very diverse and accepting across  ALL demographics.   Schools are like a private education.  Educators are some of the best in the nation! Although an expensive town to live, proud to be a resident. Quiet relative to events with the Memorial Fair as the big event of the year. Great for families , seniors and LGBTQ.  Small town center that provides all the necessities without a far drive when needed.  If you can make this town your home, you won ' t be disappointed, Read  19 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; West Simsbury is a quaint, generally quiet burrow of the town of Simsbury. The burrow of West Simsbury is 10 minutes from Simsbury downtown at its farther point, where there is a cute single-story downtown area on its main street, and well-attended events held often throughout the year, from bar-hosted trivia nights, to Summer concerts drawing thousands of attendees. West Simsbury is owned and governed by the town of Simsbury. Simsbury ' s public school system is excellent, and is ranked highly in the state, with exceptional access to elective technical, science, and college-accredited courses. There are many parks in town with access to public sports fields and complexes, jungle-gyms, forest hiking areas, and a downtown dog park. There are half-a-dozen bars in the downtown area,  which support the tame local nightlife, and easy access to route 44 in Avon, with 20 minute driving access to Hartford, where a more exciting nightlife is available. Read  8 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Darien is the best! I love living here because the schools are great, the restaurants are great. Waterfront property! This place is epic.. Everyone is very nice and chill. The real estate is very nice. We love the vibe. Read  35 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; The town of Woodbridge is a small and relatively quiet place to live with a suburban atmosphere. Based on my own experience as a student in the local schools and through interviews I recently held with town community providers for a class assignment, I am certain that Woodbridge has a great public school system. In addition, there is a great expanse of family engagement opportunities available for town residents. This includes weekly craft activities in the town center, a community farm which offers free workshops to learn gardening, and summer concerts on the town green throughout the summer. Overall, I would determine the town of Woodbridge is a well connected community and a safe place to live. Read  16 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I ' ve lived here my whole life and it is one of the prettiest places on earth. I grew up blueberry picking at Carini ' s and eating apple fritters at our festival every October. While it is expensive, the education is on the same level as a private school. I am so incredibly lucky I was raised here and could grow up in such a beautiful town. As the years have gone by, the town has definitely lost some charm (due to over development) but I am still so grateful to call it home. Read  62 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; As a resident of the town of Wilton, I want to start off by saying I have advanced through Wilton ' s school system and have received a top tier education (top 10 in Connecticut). There are roughly 270-350 kids in each grade, with a great teacher-pupil ratio. We also have one of the best Special Needs programs in Connecticut, which helps students conquer their learning disability. Wilton is extremely safe, you can see young kids attending movies, grabbing a snack at Starbucks, or just walking around our beautifully manicured town. Wilton has many highly accredited restaurants that people from other towns (and states!) travel for. Wilton is extremely close to amazing cities like Norwalk, Stamford, and NYC. Living in a densely populated area (top 4 in the country), you really don ' t feel that here. It truly is its own paradise. You can drive 3 hours north for skiing, or drive to the beaches of the Hamptons or Cape Cod for a weekend trip. Wilton can be whatever you want it to be! Read  31 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Greenwich is by far the best place to live in the NYC metro area.  Dramatically lower taxes, relaxing beaches (islands too) multiple Audubon preserves for hiking, excellent Greenwich management of facilities.   Recommendations: Take the beautiful drive on Round Hill Road, Lake Avenue, Clapboard Ridge Road, North Street - these roads are understandably called the Golden Triangle - nothing like this residential area, every home has estate like grounds surrounded with timeless stonewalls.    Formal dining:  L ' Escalier  and Harvest Wine Bar  Casual /Family Dining: Meli Melo and Beach House . If visiting during the day don ' t miss seeing Tod ' s Point, you will instantly feel like you are on a vacation far from NYC (but you are only a 50 minute train ride away). Read  70 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Everything in my opinion about Farmington is perfect! The schools are amazing and even the  " night life " . With Unionville Center here, there are restaurants and other places to go and spend time in. There are great little league teams and other types of sports to help develop the youth. Read  55 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I love living in Orange, Connecticut. The school system is great and Amity Regional High School is a Blue Ribbon School.  Eventhough it is in Woodbridge, Connecticut the town ' s of Bethany, Orange and Woodbridge students attend. The neighborhood I live in is quiet and very safe. The Boston Post Road is located in Orange and some other cities and towns. The Post Road has everything you need for your shopping needs. Also, one of my favorite places in Orange is the Old Tavern Baseball fields. I have played baseball on all of the fields. Read  42 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I ' ve lived in Madison all my life.  I ' ve been afforded a quality education and many opportunities to pursue my interests, as well as pursue new interests.  Madison is a lovely, safe shoreline community whose residents embody a true sense of  " community " .   Neighbors help neighbors whether it is in time of crisis or serving on multiple committees, boards, or town activities and programs for the betterment of Madison.  I have been blessed to call Madison my home and intend to return to raise my own family, as my parents chose to do; both having grown up here themselves. Read  29 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Very good place to live because it is so close to the center of town where everything is happening. The stores in the center are great and the food places are fun to hang around in. 10/10 great neighborhood as well. Read  1 Review Current Resident : &# xA0; We love the (relative) diversity, higher level of social awareness, walkability, food, access to nature. There is still a bit of  " gold coast "  that you have to roll your eyes at, but for the most part there ' s a lot of really good people. We went from late-20s young professionals to 30s parents of a young child during our four years so far in Fairfield. Both experiences were/have been great.  Each neighborhood in Fairfield has a really distinct personality, so I would do some additional research to see what neighborhood fits for you. We love that we can WALK to 6 parks/playgrounds, 5 beaches, hiking trails, fishing, a library that rivals some children ' s museums, national-act concerts,  &  the train to NYC or New Haven. At the same time, we have our own driveway and backyard where I can garden  &  have a bonfire with friends over without imposing on neighbors. The town amenities  &  services are great, much better than other area towns- tax $ actually worth it. Read  91 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Tarifville is a wonderful town. It it wonderfully quiet and has great parks and recreational areas to visit. I used to live in the city and this was a refreshing change! Read  1 Review Current Resident : &# xA0; Love the school system! The community is relaxed.  Residents place a high value on the natural environment.  You can hike for 60 miles on open space and be to the best malls and dining within 15 minutes. 60 minutes door to door drive to mid-town, or you can take the train from Redding station going direct to grand central in peak hours. Takes a little longer but I read a book, or the morning paper, or get ahead on my email.  So worth it!
