temperature influence of nonionic polyethylene oxide and anionic polyacrylamide on flocculation and dewatering behavior of kaolinite dispersions sciencedirect sciencedirect nonionic polyethylene oxide peo and anionic polyacrylamide pam flocculation of kaolinite dispersions has been investigated at ph 7.5 in the temperature range 20–60 °c the surface chemistry zeta potential particle interactions shear yield stress and dewatering behavior were also examined an increase in the magnitude of zeta potential of kaolinite particles in the absence of flocculant and at a fixed peo and pam concentration with increasing temperature was observed the zeta potential behavior of the flocculated particles indicated a decrease in the adsorbed polymer layer thickness while at the same time however the adsorbed polymer density showed a significant increase with increasing temperature these results suggest that polymer adsorption was accompanied by temperature-influenced conformation changes the hydrodynamic diameter and supernatant solution viscosity of both polymers decreased with increasing temperature consistent with a change in polymer–solvent interactions and conformation prior to adsorption the analysis of the free energy δ g ads of adsorption showed a strong temperature dependence and the adsorption process to be more entropically than enthalpically driven the polymer conformation change and increased negative charge at the kaolinite particle surface with increasing temperature resulted in decreased polymer bridging and flocculation performance consequently the shear yield stress and the rate and the extent of dewatering consolidation of the pulp decreased significantly at higher temperatures 40 °c the temperature effect was more pronounced in the presence of peo than pam with 40 and 20 °c indicated as the optima for enhanced performance of the latter and former flocculants respectively the results demonstrate that a temperature-induced conformation change together with polymer structure type plays an important role in flocculation and dewatering behavior of kaolinite dispersions flocculant-assisted thickening processes are commonly used in the minerals industry for the dewatering of kaolinite and other clay mineral waste tailings but these are far from being efficient high settling rates e.g. 1–10 m/h are typically achieved for kaolinite and mixed mineral oxide tails with the aid of polyelectrolytes however this good settling behavior is invariably accompanied by space-filling flocs and thickener underflow tails of characteristically low solid loadings e.g. 20–30 wt 1 2 3 several studies have shown that conventional polymeric flocculants such as high-molecular-weight nonionic and ionic polyacrylamides pam and to a limited extent unconventional nonionic polyethylene oxide peo may be used to readily dewater kaolinite and other clay mineral tailings 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 flocculation with pam however leads to space-filling flocs with low-compaction behavior the failure to achieve a high solid density during thickening of kaolinite dispersions may be attributed to several physical and chemical factors that affect the conformation and adsorption of polymeric flocculants hence the flocculation and dewatering behavior 10 11 12 13 14 15 these factors include flocculant characteristics such as molecular weight charge density functionality dosage and dilution and slurry properties such as ph ionic strength temperature the presence of simple and hydrolyzable metal ions particle surface area size zeta potential and solid concentration 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 an effective flocculant for a given dewatering application must be of the right molecular weight and charge density and contain functional groups that are predisposed to interact favorably with specific sites on the particle surface for given dispersion conditions including temperature furthermore it must also have an extended and flexible elastic configuration in the solution to achieve better particle bridging and to produce flocs capable of withstanding moderate shear forces without rupturing 1 8 19 21 22 23 the use of shear-sensitive polymers e.g. high-molecular-weight peo has been of considerable interest in recent years due to their ability to produce thickened tails of solid loadings significantly greater than those achieved with conventional flocculants e.g. pam under moderate shear conditions 11 12 23 24 25 26 peo is perceived as a flexible polymer with a structure described as a random coil and can change conformation dynamically in solution 27 28 the size of the coil is dependent upon the solvent quality which in turn is dependent on temperature concentration and molecular architecture of the polymer molecule the initial contact between particles occurs through loops and tails which suggest that the configurations of the polymer prior to and after adsorption are important the number and size of these polymer loops and tails will determine the flocculation efficiency and hence the settling rates and consolidation of kaolinite dispersions while the influence of physicochemical factors such as polymer structure type molecular weight charge density dilution solution ph and mechanical effects on flocculation and dewatering are well researched and documented the knowledge available in the literature on the influence of temperature is very limited 29 30 several of the reported studies 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 on the influence of temperature on flocculation and dewatering process indicate mixed or conflicting results according to some studies 31 32 33 34 35 enhanced flocculation of mineral dispersions such as kaolinite alumina and tio 2 occurred upon increasing temperature using peo and pam flocculants binner and murfin 36 who studied the flocculation and dewatering of alumina particles with polyacrylate observed an increase in settling rates with increasing temperature up to 45 °c which then decreased with a further increase of temperature on the other hand the studies by mohtadi and rao 37 showed that temperature did not have any noticeable effect on the flocculation of kaolinite and smectite dispersions using nonionic polymers and polyelectrolytes in the temperature range 1–20 °c a noticeable decrease of particle zeta potential with decreasing temperature was however observed temperature is thus a process variable of central importance in the dewatering of mineral dispersions as it can have a profound impact on the interactions between both mineral particles and polymer in aqueous media to date it appears that no conclusive information on how temperature affects the conformation and adsorption of a nonionic peo or anionic pam particle zeta potentials and the flocculation and dewaterability of kaolinite particles has been reported the main aim of this work therefore was to investigate the effect of temperature on the conformation and adsorption of nonionic peo and anionic pam flocculants flocculation of colloidally stable kaolinite dispersions and how this impacts on surface chemistry shear yield stress and dewatering behavior the temperature range studied was 20–60 °c as this is the range mostly encountered in clay mineral tailings treatment in industry the investigations were performed at a constant ph of 7.5 and flocculant concentration range of 0–1000 g/ton kaolinite solid colloidal-size kaolinite particles k15gm 99 pure quartz and mica 1 commercial minerals australia were used in this work the particle density and bet 39 surface area were 2.60 kg dm −3 and 24.8 m 2 g −1 respectively the median particle diameter of kaolinite particles was found to be 2.80 μm by laser diffraction a na-acrylate carboxyl-substituted polyacrylamide copolymer flocculant 30 mol anionically charged nalco australia with an average molecular weight of 2.7×10 6 was used nonionic polyethylene oxide snf australia with an average molecular weight of 2.5×10 6 was also used the chemical structures of the two polymers are shown in fig 1 average polymer particle size in solution determined at ph 7.5 and 20 °c by dynamic light scattering analysis as hydrodynamic diameter was found to be ∼ 326 ∼ 326 and 449 nm for peo and pam respectively fresh 0.1 wt polymer working solutions used were prepared daily by diluting a previously prepared 1 wt stock solution stored at room temperature analytical grade kno 3 was used to increase solution ionic strength while high-purity potassium hydroxide and nitric acid bdh australia were used to control the dispersion ph all solutions and dispersions were prepared with milli-q water surface tension 72.8 mn m −1 specific conductivity 0.5 0.5 μs cm −1 at ph 5.6 and 20 °c fig 1 structure of a nonionic polyethylene oxide peo a and a na-acrylate carboxyl-substituted anionic polyacrylamide copolymer pam b kaolinite dispersions of 8 wt solid were prepared at ph 7.5 by thoroughly mixing a known mass of kaolinite particles with a known mass of 10 −3 m kno 3 solution at an agitation speed of 250 rpm for 1 h. for each test 500 cm 3 of fresh well-mixed slurry equilibrated at 20–60 °c for 30 min was transferred to a 500 cm 3 graduated glass cylinder for flocculant addition to perform flocculation and settling tests a known volume of 0.1 wt peo or pam polymer solution was added in a single step to an 8 wt solid slurry using a syringe and mixed by moving a perforated disc plunger up and down eight times to ensure that the suspension was well homogenized and the dispersion level was visually checked all tests were carried out at ph 7.5 and isothermally at temperatures in the range 20.0–60.0±0.1 °c using a thermostatically controlled water bath the initial settling rates of the flocculated suspension was determined by recording the time taken for the mud line solid–liquid interface in the 500 cm 3 cylinder to pass between the 450 cm 3 and 350 cm 3 marks over a distance of ∼ 5.5 ∼ 5.5 cm the flocculated suspension was allowed to stand quiescently for a period of 24 h and the consolidated bed volume recorded after settling the presedimented slurries were agitated using a four-blade impeller for 5 min at 250 rpm for further consolidation the bed height was measured again after 1 h to investigate the effect of shear on final sediment bed consolidation a batch depletion method was used for determining polymer adsorption isotherms at different temperatures the adsorption measurements were conducted in 20 cm 3 vials by adding a known concentration of the flocculant to 20 cm 3 of kaolinite dispersion of 8 wt solid equilibrated either at 20 40 or 60 °c the suspension was agitated by a thermostatically controlled reciprocating water bath paton industries australia model rw 1812 for 24 h for equilibrium to be reached a 10 cm 3 aliquot of the dispersion was then removed and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min the pam solution concentration was determined by complexation using the starch–triiodide method 40 the method involves bromine oxidation of the amide functional groups with the removal of excess bromine with sodium formate the amide oxidation product converts iodide ion to iodine and is measured as a starch–triiodide complex determined using a cary 5 uv–vis spectrophotometer varian instruments operating at a wavelength of 600 nm the residual peo concentration in the supernatant was determined using the tannic acid method 41 particle zeta potential ζ was determined from dynamic mobility measurements made with an acoustosizer colloidal dynamics inc. australia the measurements were carried out on agitated suspensions 8 w/w of kaolinite particles dispersed in 10 −2 m kno 3 the 10 −2 m kno 3 was used to avoid the effect of anomalous surface conductance on the zeta potential which can be present in kaolinite clay systems at very low electrolyte concentrations 42 a thermostatically controlled water bath connected to the conditioning vessel x27 s water jacket was used to maintain a constant temperature calibrations using k 4 siw 12 o 40 were performed once a day prior to zeta potential analysis depending on the state or flow behavior e.g. low or high yield stress of the flocculated dispersion agitation rates between 500 and 2000 rpm were used the conductivity temperature and ph were continuously monitored in situ using probes attached to the instrument when a nonionic polymer is adsorbed on a particle surface a displacement of the shear plane takes place with respect to its position in the absence of the adsorbed polymer this displacement is dependent upon the thickness of the adsorbed polymer layer 43 the decrease in zeta potential may be related to the shift in the shear plane which corresponds to the hydrodynamic thickness of the adsorbed polymer layer δ and is calculated for nonionic polymers e.g. peo using the expression 43 1 tanh zeζ 2 4kt tanh zeζ 1 4kte κ δ −δ tanh zeζ 2 4kt tanh zeζ 1 4kte κ δ −δ where ζ 1 and ζ 2 are the particle zeta potentials in the presence and absence of polymer respectively z is valency of ions in the double layer δ is the adsorbed layer thickness k is the boltzmann constant t is the absolute temperature 1/ κ is the debye length e is the electron charge and δ is the thickness of the stern plane fleer 44 and fleer et al 45 estimated a value of 0.4 nm for δ at an ionic strength of 0.001 m and a similar approach has been adopted in the present calculation as the ionic strengths are comparable this method is satisfactory when measurements are performed in indifferent electrolyte solutions several studies 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 have used this approach to determine the layer thickness of nonionic homo- and copolymers adsorbed at solid–liquid and liquid–liquid interfaces it is assumed that the shear plane displacement is the only effect the adsorbed polymer has on the double layer properties and that the ion distribution in the double layer does not alter upon polymer adsorption as this approach is unsuitable for adsorbed polyelectrolytes only the adsorbed layer thickness of peo was determined in the present work using eq 1 the rheological shear yield stress measurements which provided an indication of the particle interactions in kaolinite dispersions were performed with respect to slurry interfacial chemistry the yield stress was directly measured using the vane technique 53 54 the advantage of the vane technique is that it eliminates slip usually encountered with the cuvette concentric cylinder technique when dealing with highly structured dispersions the 8 wt solid dispersions used in the zeta potential and settling tests were too dilute to give meaningful rheological data hence only the flocculated kaolinite dispersion of 28 wt solid content was used in yield stress analysis the vane was immersed in the flocculated kaolinite dispersions and rotated at a low and constant rate of 0.2 rpm a thermostatted water-jacketed vessel connected to a temperature-controlled water bath maintained a constant temperature the volume of the sample used was 100 cm 3 the length radius and blade thickness of the vane used were 30.17 25.02 and 0.55 mm respectively the flocculant solution flow properties and polymer molecular conformation were probed by investigating the absolute viscosity as a function of temperature the viscosity was measured using an ubbelohde-type capillary viscometer canon instrument usa type oc with a calibration constant of 0.002749 mm 2 s −2 peo and pam concentrations of 0.1 wt were used as this corresponded to the initial polymer solution concentration used in flocculation refractive indices ri of the solutions were measured in triplicate using an abbe high accuracy 60/ed refractometer bellingham and stanley england with temperature control to within ± 0.1 ± 0.1 °c the precision of the refractive index determination was ± 0.0001 ± 0.0001 the ri data were used for polymer hydrodynamic size estimation carried out by dynamic light scattering dls analysis lexel model 95 argon ion laser brookhaven photomultiplier at 20–60 °c all dls measurements were performed at a concentration of 0.05 wt polymer this dilute concentration was used because the resulting interparticle spacing is so large that the polymer molecule interactions are minimized 55 furthermore this concentration is close to polymer concentration observed upon addition of a known volume of 0.1 wt to a 500 cm 3 pulp to give 500 g ton/solid a high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope fesem philips xl30 was used to examine the kaolinite floc structures formed at 500 g flocculant/ton solid before and after shear at different temperatures samples were analyzed after rapid vitrification to avoid drying which can cause internal structure rearrangement or modification to vitrify them microgram size slurry samples were placed in copper rivets 7 mm length of two rivets joined together and 1 mm internal diameter using a small microsyringe the rivets were then mounted onto a cryogenic transfer rod and very rapidly plunged ∼ 2 ∼ 2 m s −1 into liquid propane that was cooled by submersion in liquid nitrogen to solidify and arrest all supramolecular motion the vitrified samples were transferred to and kept in a liquid-nitrogen-cooled specimen stage of the fesem the samples were fractured under vacuum by breaking off the top rivet the vitrified water was then removed by sublimation at a temperature of −90 °c avoiding local melting by excessive temperature rises after 5 min at this temperature the stage temperature was lowered again to approximately −180 °c to stop any further sublimation the samples were then coated with platinum to a thickness of 3 nm using a high-resolution sputter coater they were subsequently analyzed at an accelerating voltage in the range 5–10 kv fig 2 shows the zeta potential of kaolinite particles at 8 wt solid content and 10 −2 m kno 3 electrolyte and as a function of peo a and pam b concentration and at temperatures 20 40 and 60 °c at ph 7.5 in the absence of flocculant the zeta potential became more negative from −30 to −34 to −46 mv with increasing temperature a finding which is in good agreement of previous studies 37 38 fig 2 electrokinetic zeta potential of kaolinite in 10 −2 m kno 3 at 8 wt solids as a function of peo a and pam b concentration and temperature 20 ● 40 ○ and 60 °c ▾ at ph 7.5 in the presence of both peo and pam the magnitude of the zeta potential decreased with increasing polymer concentration however the decrease was more dramatic with peo than pam the reduction in zeta potential is attributed to the effect of the shift in the plane of shear away from the particle surface 43 for pam which is 30 anionically charged the small decrease in zeta potential with increasing flocculant concentration may be due to a shift in the position of plane shear due to the adsorbed layer being offset by an increase in charge around the particles of the negatively charged carboxyl groups of the polymer peo appears to adsorb more onto kaolinite particles than pam at all temperatures a finding which is strongly supported by the adsorption data below the adsorbed layer thickness as a function of temperature and peo concentrations calculated according to eq 1 is shown in fig 3 the layer thickness decreased with increasing temperature consistent with the zeta potential data the adsorption density of peo a and pam b at ph 7.5 as a function of equilibrium polymer concentration in solution and at temperatures 20 40 and 60 °c is shown in fig 4 the polymer adsorption increased steadily with increasing equilibrium concentration until a plateau was reached for each temperature the maximum adsorption density of pam was lower than peo at similar temperatures it appears that the negatively charged coo − pendant of the pam reduced its adsorption onto the negatively charged particles the observed adsorption densities are significantly lower than those reported for other flocculated systems such as peo and sio 2 moo 3 and v 2 o 5 particles 26 ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose and sio 2 52 and polysaccharide and talc 50 fig 3 adsorbed layer thickness as a function of peo concentration and temperature 20 ● 40 ○ and 60 °c ▾ at ph 7.5 fig 4 adsorption isotherm of peo a and pam b as a function of temperature 20 ○ 40 ● and 60 °c ▾ at ph 7.5 and 10 −3 m kno 3 according to polymer adsorption theory 29 an increase in adsorption density with increasing temperature is expected since the flory–huggins interaction parameter χ which relates to the enthalpy of mixing for both peo and pam and solvency increases with increasing temperature 49 a decrease in solvency as temperature increases is indicated hence the adsorption density increased these results are however inconsistent with the adsorbed layer thickness or zeta potential data all adsorption isotherms for peo and pam onto kaolinite particles at all different temperatures were fitted to the langmuir adsorption isotherm model 58 given by 2 c eq x/m 1 k x/m max c eq x/m max c eq x/m 1 k x/m max c eq x/m max where c eq mg dm −3 is the equilibrium solution concentration of polymer x is the amount of polymer adsorbed mg dm −3 m is the total solid particle surface area per unit volume m 2 dm −3 k is the langmuir adsorption constant dm 3 mg −1 and x m max is the maximum amount of polymer adsorbed per unit solid surface area a linear relationship should be obtained when c eq x m is plotted against c eq the assumptions made for the derivation of eq 2 are that the solute flocculant and solvent water have equal molecular cross-sectional surface areas there is no net solute–solvent interaction in the surface or bulk phases and the adsorption process is reversible it is acknowledged that these assumptions may not be fully justified in the case of polymer adsorption the langmuirian treatment of the low affinity adsorption process of the present work allows a direct and consistent semiquantitative comparison to be made between peo and pam adsorption thermodynamics in the manner of recent flocculation studies of talc 50 silica 52 and hematite 62 dispersions consequently useful mechanistic information relating to the exact contributions of entropic and enthalpic effects has emerged it is pertinent to note that more sophisticated models 29 58 exist for quantitative treatment of the polymer adsorption process but they are not readily intractable in the terms of the present experimentally measured variables for deconvoluting the adsorption thermodynamics the values of k and x m max can be determined respectively from the intercept and gradient of such a plot a plot of c eq x m as a function of c eq for peo a and pam b at three different temperatures is shown in figs 5a and 5b respectively and clearly conforms to a langmuir type of adsorption as depicted by the linearity of the plots values of k x m max and δ max are given in table 1 for comparison a significant variation is seen in the k and x m max values which are observed to increase while δ max decreased with increasing temperature it is clearly evident that more polymer was adsorbed at 60 than at 40 or 20 °c k represents the affinity of the polymers for a particular particle surface and may be related to the gibbs free energy of adsorption δ g ads j mol −1 as 3 δ g ads =−rt ln k δ g ads =−rt ln k 4 δ g ads δ h ads −t δ s ads δ g ads δ h ads −t δ s ads where r is the general gas constant

mol −1 changes for peo and pam adsorption was made determined from the intercept and gradient of the straight line respectively it is assumed that both parameters are independent of temperature over the range studied 45 fig 5 langmuir plot of the adsorption of peo a and pam b at temperature 20 ● 40 ○ and 60 °c ▾ at ph 7.5 table 1 the calculated values of x m max k and δ max for the adsorption of peo a and pam b onto kaolinite at ph 7.5 at various temperatures fig 6 plot of δ g ads for peo ● and pam ○ as a function of temperature the estimated parameters δ h ads − t δ s ads and δ g ads for peo a and pam b are shown in table 2 the δ g ads values are found to be negative increasing in magnitude with increasing temperature and of similar order of magnitude to the free energy of formation of 1 mole of hydrogen bonds −20.9 kj mol −1 55 the data not only indicate that the adsorption of peo and pam onto kaolinite is not only more favorable at elevated temperatures but also suggest that the adsorption process is dominated by entropic rather than enthalpic effects since δ h ads −t δ s ads δ h ads −t δ s ads table 2 thermodynamic parameters for peo a and pam b adsorption onto kaolinite at ph 7.5 the viscosity and polymer hydrodynamic size diameter of the peo and pam solutions measured as a function of temperature relate to solvency and polymer conformation prior to adsorption onto kaolinite particle surface it is evident from fig 7 for the viscosity data of a 0.1 wt polymer solution that the solvent quality as determined by water–polymer and polymer–polymer interactions was significantly affected by temperature the viscosity decreased markedly with increasing temperature and this is believed to be due to a breakdown of polymer–water hydrogen bond interactions and concomitant changes of polymer molecular conformation the polymer chains may be considered more expanded in space due to stronger water–polymer interactions via hydrogen bonding at the lower temperature range 20–40 °c hence a higher viscosity resulted with the disruption of the water–polymer hydrogen bonds at higher temperatures the polymer–polymer interactions became more favored and led to the formation of a more coiled or contracted conformation this is clearly shown by the average hydrodynamic size of the polymer units in fig 8 below fig 7 absolute viscosity of 0.1 wt peo ● and pam ○ concentration as a function of temperature fig 8 hydrodynamic size of polymer units in solution at 0.05 wt peo ● and pam ○ as a function of temperature in the temperature range 20–40 °c the hydrodynamic diameter of both peo and pam were substantially constant thereafter it decreased sharply as the temperature was further increased fig 8 this observation is consistent with a good solvent prevailing at 20–40 °c and the polymer chains are more solvated to a larger size than at a higher temperature where a more tightly coiled chain results from a poor solvent at similar molecular weights and concentrations pam has a higher hydrodynamic size than peo this may be due to the fact that the anionic charge of the pam molecules substantially facilitated polymer chain expansion and enhanced the effective hydrodynamic volume in solution the shear yield stress which is diagnostic of the floc strength may be considered as a measure of the maximum force per unit area that the floc can withstand before rupturing it is related to the total energy e sep required to separate the flocs into single units by the following expression 59 60 61 5 τ b =3φ s n e sep 8πr 3 τ b =3φ s n e sep 8πr 3 where φ s is the volume fraction of the primary particles in the dispersion n is the average number of contacts per particle in the floc i.e. the coordination number assumed to be 12 for a face-centered cubic arrangement and r is the radius of the primary particles the effect of temperature on shear yield stress and energy of separation floc strength at 500 g peo or pam/ton solid and 28 wt solid kaolinite dispersions is shown in fig 9 a decrease in shear yield stress and energy of separation with increasing temperature was observed consistent with other studies 57 involving tio 2 dispersions the plot of e sep as a function of flocculant concentration was similar to that of τ b with e sep decreasing from 1200 to 260 kt for peo and 1000 to 200 kt for pam as the temperature increased thus the presence of peo resulted in stronger particle interactions than did pam the lower yield stress observed at higher temperatures 40 °c is believed to be due to the polymer conformation changes and reduced hydrogen bonding that occurred and led to weakened polymer-mediated interparticle bridging forces fig 9 bingham shear yield stress and energy of separation of 28 wt kaolinite flocculated with 500 g/ton solids peo ● and pam ○ concentration as a function of temperature at ph 7.5 and 10 −3 m kno 3 the initial settling rates of 8 wt solid kaolinite slurry shown as a function of temperature indicate a strong temperature dependence fig 10 a slight increase in flocculation performance and hence settling rates was observed as the suspension temperature was increased up to 40 °c for peo however beyond 40 °c the settling rates decreased significantly previous studies 34 showed that increasing temperature from 25 to 95 °c increased flocculation performance and settling rates of coal particles using peo upon flocculation with pam the initial settling rates decreased monotonically with temperature in the range 20–60 °c additionally peo produced higher settling rates than did pam and this may be attributed to differences in the polymer structure-related characteristics e.g. charge and conformation the settling behavior of flocculated kaolinite dispersions suggests that an optimum temperature exists for enhanced flocculation with peo shown to be around 40 °c this observation is in good agreement with other studies of polyacrylate-flocculated alumina dispersions 36 it was reported that a further increase in temperature beyond 45 °c hindered the settling behavior considerably the decrease in settling rates with increasing temperature for both flocculants may be explained in terms of conformation changes as well as weakened hydrogen bonding resulting from increased particle charge improved dewatering behavior was achieved at 500 g flocculant/ton kaolinite which gives adsorption densities ∼ 50 ∼ 50 of saturation coverage values fig 10 initial settling rates of 8 wt solid kaolinite dispersions flocculated at 500 g peo ● and pam ○ /ton solid as a function of temperature at ph 7.5 and 10 −3 m kno 3 the polymer conformational changes also had a strong impact on the sediment solid content as indicated by the data in fig 11 before and after shear at 250 rpm for 5 min and a polymer concentration of 500 g/ton solid a much better consolidation is observed at a temperature of 20–40 °c for peo and 20 °c for pam in comparison with 60 °c without shear upon agitation the peo-flocculated slurries showed a dramatic improvement in consolidation at 20–40 °c which decreased thereafter as the temperature was further increased to 60 °c however for pam no significant improvement in consolidation was observed before and after shear the flocs formed were mostly destroyed upon moderate shearing fig 11 sediment solid content of kaolinite as a function of temperature flocculated at 500 g/ton solid peo before ● and after shear ○ and pam before ▾ and after shear ▿ at ph 7.5 and 10 −3 m kno 3 for peo large flocs which coalesced and densified into a single mass upon shearing resulted the dense flocs could be hand-squeezed like a sponge into a paste consistency causing further removal of the supernatant it appears that in the temperature range 20–40 °c for peo the stretched and dangling polymer flexible chain bridges the small flocs to larger flocs compacting the flocs further and thus more water is excluded this behavior highlights the exceptional flexible characteristics of peo which facilitate the formation of compressible flocs capable of withstanding moderate shear forces growing denser without rupturing the flocs formed beyond 40 °c were easily destroyed upon shearing and could not be compacted by squeezing the decrease in pulp consolidation behavior with increase in temperature is consistent with the conformation changes that occurred sem micrographs of floc structures of the kaolinite flocculated at 500 g peo or pam/ton solid of at varying temperatures before and after shear are shown in fig 12 fig 13 respectively a more compacted floc structure of peo flocculated slurries produced at 20 and 40 than at 60 °c is clearly evident the flocs produced at 20–40 °c were denser aggregates and less prone to breakage upon shear while at 60 °c the floc structure was more fragile and open with large voids of trapped supernatant for the pam flocculated slurries the floc structures were more open and less compact in comparison with peo at all temperatures as the temperature was increased the floc structures became more open with larger voids which upon shear were easily destroyed fig 12 scanning electron micrographs of kaolinite dispersions flocculated at 500 g/ton solid peo at ph 7.5 and 10 −3 m kno 3 before shear and after shear at different temperatures fig 13 scanning electron micrographs of kaolinite dispersions flocculated at 500 g/ton solid pam at ph 7.5 and 10 −3 m kno 3 before shear and after shear at different temperatures the present study has revealed that the adsorption of peo and pam on kaolinite surfaces and the subsequent flocculation and dewatering processes were greatly dependent upon the dispersion temperature temperature had a profound effect on the particle zeta potential polymer adsorbed layer thickness and adsorption density and the shear yield stress settling rates and consolidation of the kaolinite dispersions the zeta potential of unflocculated kaolinite particles became more negative with increasing temperature indicative of increased deprotonation of silanol and aluminol surface groups which may be ascribed to partial dissolution of the kaolinite particles the reduction in zeta potential in the presence of polymer coupled with the polymer-structure-dependent adsorbed layer thicknesses and densities provided useful insight into the conformation of peo and pam in order to fully elucidate the influence of temperature it is important to understand the underlying polymer adsorption and conformation mechanisms the conformation of a polymer in bulk solution or at the particle–solution interface is dependent upon the polymer–solvent interactions which may be defined in terms of the flory–huggins parameter χ 29 the amount of polymer adsorbed as a function of temperature was found to be at odds with the adsorbed layer thickness δ and zeta potential data there was a collapse from an expanded to a more compact polymer structure as the polymer solution or flocculated dispersion temperature was increased from 40 to 60 °c the increased adsorbed amount accompanied by a marked decrease in adsorbed layer thickness with increasing temperature may be attributed to a decrease in solvency which in turn influenced the polymer conformation 44 when χ 0.5 the polymer will be extended in a good solvent resulting in a higher δ as opposed to the condition of poor solvency χ 0.5 where it will be in a more contracted state an expanded polymer conformation which prevailed in a good solvent at a lower temperature 40 40 °c changing to a more compact one in a poor solvent as the temperature is increased up to 60 °c is depicted in fig 14 similar polymer conformation behavior has been reported for ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose adsorption onto silica 52 and peo onto kaolinite dispersions in the presence of a sodium sulfate 31 the observed trend is however contrary to the findings of other studies 56 57 which reported a decrease in nonionic polyacrylamide adsorption molecular weight of ∼1.2×10 6 onto kaolinite with increasing temperature fig 14 schematic illustration of a possible conformation for the adsorbed peo and pam at the kaolinite–solution interface at temperatures a 20–40 °c peo and 20 °c pam and b 60 °c peo and 20 °c pam the temperature influenced conformation change in solution as reflected by polymer hydrodynamic size solution viscosity and adsorption data are in good agreement with the flocculated pulp dewatering and rheological behavior in a good solvent more loops and tails were available at greater adsorbed polymer layer thickness facilitating effective interparticle bridging consequently better flocculation performance leading to higher settling rates and greater sediment consolidation occurred at 20–40 °c with increasing temperature collapse of the stretched and dangling polymer chain with fewer loops and tails but more trains which occurred and resulted in less effective bridging with poor dewatering behavior as a consequence of the polymer conformation change and concomitant reduction in polymer bridging forces the flocculated pulp yield stress decreased with increasing temperature the higher pulp yield stress produced by peo indicates its greater enhancement of particle interactions leading to more strongly networked flocs than those produced by pam the results demonstrate that the strength of aggregates formed in flocculated kaolinite dispersions is strongly temperature and polymer structure dependent analysis of flocculant adsorption thermodynamics indicated that entropic effects were more dominant than enthalpic effects in the adsorption mechanism this may be rationalized in terms of the loss of polymer translational freedom upon polymer adsorption only partially offsets the large entropy gain from the release of bound hydration water around the polymer chains and at the particle surface similar findings have been made for guar gum adsorbing onto talc 50 with increasing suspension temperature the brønsted acid sites at the kaolinite particle surfaces decreased as indicated by the zeta potential which increased i.e. became more negative and this also mitigated interactions with the lewis base functional groups of peo co and pam ocnh 2 for adsorption consequently the nonionic peo showed a stronger temperature-mediated effect than the 30 anionically charged pam the results show that temperature plays a pivotal role in the interactions between high-molecular-weight polymeric flocculants peo and pam and kaolinite with a marked impact on pulp rheology and dewatering behavior the conformation change that was produced by temperature variation resulted in a significant reduction in settling rates and consolidation the findings exemplify how the effect of temperature is of significant importance during tailings treatment in flocculant-assisted thickening processes as used in the minerals industry where substantial thickener temperature variations occur from summer to winter the outcomes demonstrate that it is possible to control the flocculation performance and the dewaterability of mineral waste tailings by controlling pulp temperature the influence of temperature on peo and pam flocculant adsorption interfacial chemistry particle interactions and dewatering behavior of kaolinite dispersions has been investigated temperature had a pronounced effect on the magnitude of zeta potential of kaolinite particles which increased sharply at a fixed peo and pam concentration with increasing temperature reflecting a decrease in the adsorbed layer thicknesses the adsorbed amount of peo and pam was found to increase with increasing temperature suggesting a reduction in solvency of the polymer good flocculation performance and dewatering behavior was achieved at 500 g flocculant/ton kaolinite which gives adsorption densities well below saturation coverage hydrodynamic diameter and solution viscosity of both polymers decreased with increasing temperature consistent with a reduced polymer–solvent interactions and a more contracted polymer conformation the adsorption data showed that the free energy of polymer adsorption was strongly temperature-dependent and that peo and pam adsorption onto kaolinite particles entropically dominated rather than enthalpically driven the dispersion shear yield stress decreased with increasing temperature reflecting reduced interparticle bridging forces the results indicate that with increasing the dispersion temperature from 20–40 to 60 °c a change from a expanded to a contracted polymer conformation occurred consequently higher settling rates and greater consolidation of the dispersions were observed at a lower temperature range 20–40 °c where an expanded polymer conformation was preferred the temperature influence was more pronounced in the presence of nonionic peo rather than anionic pam the temperature-mediated polymer conformation change which occurred together with polymer-structure type plays a predominant role in the flocculation and dewatering behavior of kaolinite dispersions
