considered in detail ita no 225/hyd/2012 ay 2002-03 3 in this assessment year assessee had originally filed returnof income and consequent to the notice u/s 153a filed returnadmitting the same loss of rs 1,01,187/- as originally returned.even though there were search and seizure operations as seenfrom the assessment orders passed there seems to be noincriminating material in the search identified and seized eventhough certain documents pertaining to quantity 's details detailsof sales and certain transactions with the parties at jabalpur nagpur and hyderabad etc. were seized and listed as a specificreference in para 3 of the order under the head 'seized material asseen from the order s there is no correlation with those seizeddocuments with reference to any of the specific issues consideredby the ao when enquired in the course of arguments ld.counsel admitted that those details are not incriminating butneither assessee nor ao bothered to examine about thesedocuments the only issue taken up by the ao is with reference to m/s balaji steel rolling mills pvt ltd. 4 m/s balaji steel rolling industriesunaccounted production based on the electricity consumption ofthe unit ao in the course of assessment noticed that assesseehad adopted a modus operandi of introducing cash in substantialamounts during the financial year as advances and offering themas income under the head 'other income at the end of the year asadvances forfeited ao noted down in para 5 of the order theextent of advances so forfeited totaling to rs 9,19,35,000/- eventhough assessee offered on these amounts as incomes underregular returns and not as a consequence of search ao was of theview that assessee could not substantiate from whom theadvances were received he was of the opinion that assesseemight be producing the steel ingots outside the books of accountsand proceeds are introduced as advances in the books ofaccounts therefore he undertook an exercise of analyzing theconsumption of power recorded in units in the years 2000-01 to2006-07 based on the enquiries conducted with m/s spongeiron india ltd. and also on the expertise of a technical officerdeputed by that company the ao came to an opinion that averageconsumption for production of one ton of ms ingots is generallyabout 800 850 kwh he also opined that as far as presentoperations are concerned the consumption may be about 1100 -1200 per kwh per ton of ingots considering assessee 's businessoperations on obtaining the information from central powerdistribution company limited and taking the consumption in ay.2000-01 as the basis 1260 kwh per ton of ingot ao arrived atsuppressed production of 2,028 tons out of 59,24,297 kwh unitsof power consumed assessee has shown production of 2,673 tonsin the books of accounts whereas ao arrived at possibleproduction at 4,701 tons after arriving at the possibleproduction ao gave credit for the raw-material that may be m/s balaji steel rolling mills pvt ltd. 5

whilereferring to certain paras in the report it was submitted that'while in most of the cases marshalling of evidence acquired fromthe investigation does not prove enough for the tribunal or thecourse to uphold the allegation of clandestine removal in few casesthe allegations have survived due to systematic investigation by m/s balaji steel rolling mills pvt ltd. 7 m/s balaji steel rolling industriessome very hard working officers of the department then hereferred to the findings in the said case to submit that forproduction of one metric ton of mild steel ingots the averagepower consumption would be in the range of 555 kwh 1026kwh as per the scientific studies conducted by iit kanpur itwas submitted that in this case also the ao has examined theissue meticulously and arrived at the suppressed production andcit a was not correct in deleting the same 6 ld counsel for assessee however relied on the order of thecit a and submitted that 6.1 coming to the legal grounds it was submitted that theassessments have been completed u/s 143 1 from assessmentyears 2000-01 to 2004-05 and since no scrutiny was undertaken these assessments could not get abated on the

confirmed bythe hon'ble bombay high court in the case of cit vs. continentalwarehousing corporation nhava sheva ltd in ita no 523 of2013 dt.21-04-2015 it is further submitted that even thoughhon'ble jurisdictional high court in the case of gopal lalbhadruka vs. dcit 346 itr 106 ap has upheld the additions in spite of not having incriminating material ld counselsubmitted that the co-ordinate bench at bombay in the case ofacit vs. jayendra p. jhaveri 65 sot 118 mumbai uro hasheld that where re-assessments made by the ao u/s 153awithout any incriminating material being found during searchaction are not in accordance with law and consequently returned/original assessments which acquired finality are to bereiterated apart from the legal principles ld counsel alsoreferred to the orders passed by the central excise authoritieswhich are also relied before the cit a to submit that there is nosuppressed production or suppressed sales as per the centralexcise/sales tax authorities it was submitted that order of thecit a is to be upheld 7 we have considered the rival contentions and perused andorders of the authorities as can be seen from the orders of theao even though it refers to certain documents which areimpounded seized no adverse view was taken about the contentstherein the order does not speak of any incriminating nature ofthe said documents the only issue which ao has adjudicated isthe high consumption of electricity in assessee 's case as per theaverage norm of an ideal business situation the powerconsumption would be around 800 1000 kwh on which there m/s balaji steel rolling mills pvt ltd. 9 m/s balaji steel rolling industriesare various studies but is it possible to determine theunaccounted production on the basis of the ideal consumption ofpower in an ideal unit generally in the market various cars aresold with the projection of 20 to 23 kms per liter of mileage but onroad conditions it is everybody 's experience that car does notgiven more than 10 to 12 kms mileage per liter there is a lot ofvariation between ideal test conditions and actual businessconditions it was assessee 's explanation that high powerconsumption was a result of in view of this it was submitted that consumption of power ishigh ao has taken sufficient pains in referring the matter to thechairman and managing director of sponge iron india ltd. andalso being examined by a technical officer of the said company but there is a disclaimer by the company itself that thosestatements made by the technical officer is based on his personalexperiences and can not be used adversely that it self takes awaythe basis of ao 's working not only that ao himself accepts thatassessee 's consumption of 1,260 kwh is on the basis of theproduction figures as shown in ay 2001-02 he has taken thatyear as basis for arriving at the production in all the impugnedassessment years including the later year of 2006-07 to 2008-09 post search on the same basis he has not considered theobjections raised by assessee at all moreover as explained byassessee 's counsel and also considered the ld cit a the various m/s balaji steel rolling mills pvt ltd. 10 m/s balaji steel rolling industriesshow cause notices issued by the excise department have beenmore or less settled in favour of assessee and no adverse view canbe taken on the basis of the show cause notices it has no bearingon the sales figures of assessee as there is no case of centralexcise for any suppressed production even though ld dr reliedon the central excise case press note before us it is a case by thecentral excise department for suppressed production on ameticulous enquiry by the officer which was upheld by thetribunal in this case in spite of conducting search and seizureoperations no incriminating material was found as seen from theorder in ita no 1555/hyd/2011 which will be considered later inthis order ld cit a while upholding the addition in that year gave credit to the amount of advances forfeited and shown as'income which revenue has accepted and has not contested ifthe same stand is taken assessee 's income offered by way offorfeiture of advances is to the extent of rs 1,49,60,000/-whereas the addition made was only rs 1,06,80,527/- in view ofthat also there is no scope for any addition being made in thepresent case as rightly contended by the ld counsel books ofaccounts were not rejected the addition made by the ao ispurely on the basis of estimation of power consumption andsupposedly suppressed production can not be sustained in theabsence of any evidence on record keeping these aspects in mind we uphold the order of the ld cit a and reject the revenue'sgrounds in the result this appeal is dismissed ita nos 226 to 230/hyd/2012 8 the facts being same except amounts involved in the aboveappeals we uphold the orders of the cit a and reject therevenue 's contentions m/s balaji steel rolling mills pvt ltd. 11 m/s balaji steel rolling industries 9 in the results appeals in ita nos 225 to 230/hyd/2012 aredismissed m/s balaji steel rolling industries 10 as seen from various appeals revenue has completedassessments of this firm using the company pan number only inay.2008-09 the correct pan number is used in these appealsalso similar to the one which ao passed in the appeals of m/s.balaji steel rolling mills pvt ltd. above the ao estimated thesuppressed production on similar lines ld cit a afterconsidering assessee 's submissions deleted the addition more orless on the similar reasons as stated above for the sake ofrecord in ay 2001-02 ao made an addition of rs 30,91,330/-by arriving at the suppressed income while determining the powerconsumption for production of one ton of 'flats and rods inassessee 's business at 200 kwh after recording that the sisterconcern in ay 2000-01 consumed only 132 kwh per ton he alsoallowed burning loss of 12 for the purpose of determiningrequisite raw-material since electricity was already debited to thep l a/c the suppressed consumption of raw-material was givenset off against the suppressed sales of production and a nominalconsumption of store items on consumption of 2,83,573/- unitsof power ao arrived at surplus production at 1,212 tons anddetermined the income at rs 30,91,330/- ld cit a vide orderdt 14-03-2011 deleted the same by stating as under 5.1 with regard to making addition by the ao on the basis ofpower consumption for production quantifying the sales afterallowing certain expenses towards cost of raw materials theappellant has submitted as under while completing the assessment without any evidence on record theassessing officer determined production on the basis of electricityconsumption without appreciating the fact that the appellant 's mill is a smallunit and is labour oriented consisting of very old outdated machinery.consumption of electricity depends on so many factors such as maintenanceof electrical equipment irregular supply of electricity power shutdown fluctuation in power and quality and quantity of raw material the assessingofficer compared the power consumption with reference to the sponge ironindia limited a public sector undertaking which is modernized and fullyequipped automatic unit the production of finished goods depends onvarious factors such as quality and quantity of raw material and climaticconditions the production of appellant 's unit is subject to levy of excise dutyand the officials of the excise department visit the factory premises every nowand then and keep watch on removal of goods and payment of excise duty andthey also come for audit of production and payment of duty on removal ofgoods sales tax assessments have been completed for all the above assessmentyears and no discrepancy has been noticed in the reported turnover there isno evidence with the department to prove that the appellant had manufacturedcertain goods and removed them other than what has been declared properexcise registers have been maintained the information obtained from thetechnical officer can not be relied on for the simple reason that the chairman-cum-managing director of the said company has specifically stated in hiscommunication to the department as under please note that information furnished by our officer is basedon his individual knowledge views expressed and it can not betaken is an authority for any purpose as it may differ from thepoint of view of other technical officer in other words the managing director of the sponge iron india ltd. is not sure about the actual consumption of unit for manufacturingof foods as the appellant already stated herein above consumptionof electricity depends upon the various factors since the appellant'sunit is a labour oriented negligence and laziness of the labourers slow work tactics temperature in summer which makes humanbeing partly lazy unworkable and supply of power with frequentinterruption all these cause consumption of electricity therefore the figure for arriving the production on the basis of electricityconsumption is not correct and proper method specially whengoods are subject to levy of excise and sales tax the ao has not m/s balaji steel rolling mills pvt ltd. 13 m/s balaji steel rolling industriesfound any deficiency or discrepancy in the books of ale and has notrejected them the appellant has placed reliance on the following case laws i n. rajpullaiah vs dcto kurnool and another 73 itr 224 ap ii st.terasa 's oil mill vs state of kerala reported in itr 365 kerala iii dcit vs royal marwar tobacco product p ltd. reported in ahmd.tribunal reported in 29 sot 53 ahd uro without prejudice to the above contention it is submitted that onthe page-6 of the assessment order the assessing officer hasobserved as under the sums introduced camouflaged as advance is sham source from thesuppressed trading receipts introduced to meet the basis recorded expenditure therefore the assessing officer ought to have given credit againstthe estimated income in respect of his own observation which hehas made in respect of amount forfeited and offered as income bythe appellant 5.2 i have considered the submissions made by the appellant gonethrough the order of the assessing officer it is a fact that theappellant is a small-scale unit existing for the last many years themachinery was very old and power consumption is heavy it is truethat consumption of electricity depends on so many factors such asmaintenance of electrical equipment irregular supply of electricity power shutdown fluctuation in power and quality and quantity ofraw material etc it is also a fact that the ao has compared thepower consumption with reference to the sponge iron india limited a public sector undertaking that is modernized and fully equipped1utomatic unit and thus comparison is ill founded as it has givenabsurd results moreover production of appellant 's unit is .subjectto check by excise and sales tax authorities the officials of thosedepartments visit now and then keep a watch on production and removal of finished products and conduct inspection whenever it isfelt necessary finally they make assessments who have notfound out any discrepancies in production and sales thus theadditions made by the ao for all the impugned assessment yearswith out any material has to be presumed based on surmises andguess work and for such additions there is no place in search andseizure assessments thus i do not have any hesitation indirecting the ao to delete the additions made for all the assessmentyears under challenge m/s balaji steel rolling mills pvt ltd. 14 m/s balaji steel rolling industries 11 after considering the rival contentions and perusing theorders of the authorities we do not see any reason to interfere withthe order of the cit a in all the impugned years the additionbeing similar the reasons given above in the case of m/s balajisteel rolling mills pvt ltd. will equally apply here in view of thedetailed reasons stated above we do not see any reason toconsider the revenue 's grounds in the result orders of the cit a are upheld and all the appeals in ita nos 862 to 868/hyd/2012are dismissed ita no 1367/hyd/2014 12 this order was passed by the cit a on 19-05-2014 whereinld cit a deleted the addition of rs 35,97,380/- by giving thefollowing reasons 06.3 on a consideration of the facts of the case for the asst year2000-01 it is seen that in the instant case the estimation ofsuppressed income is based only on the working done by theassessing officer after considering the power consumed forproduction which led him to the conclusion that such powerconsumption must have been made for higher production whichwas not disclosed by the appellant however even if the powerconsumption was on a higher side it is seen that the hon'blesupreme court in their judgement dated 31-1-2011 in the case ofcommissioner of central excise meerut vs. r.a casting p ltdhave opined that electricity consumption can not be taken to be areliable basis for estimating the production of a particular unit.citing the said decision the hon'ble chandigarh bench of the itatin the case of arora alloys ltd vs. ito ita no.78jcsdj2012 dated1-3-2012 have opined that the reason for the above view is thatconsumption for electricity depends upon various recrors ike typeand quality of scrap used number of break downs quality oflabour/supervisory staff diligence of management etc accordingly in the said case the hon'ble itat held that the ao 's action inestimating the production of the assessee company on the basis ofalleged excessive consumption of electricity is erroneous andfallacious it is seen that a similar view has been taken by thehon'ble ahmedabad bench of the itat in the case of easternenterprises vs. acit ita no.352/ahd/2010 dated 15-6-2012 also wherein they opined that the consumption of electricity mayrise due to hundreds of factors and therefore no addition isjustified 06.4 it is clear that in the present case apart from estimatingproduction on the basis of excessive consumption of electricity determined on comparison with the consumption figures of a largepublic sector undertaking the assessing officer has not been ableto bring on record any other evidence to support his conclusionregarding unaccounted production following the decisions of thehon'ble itat cited above and also the appellate orders passed bythe cit a guntur and cit a -i hyderabad on identical facts andcircumstances in the appellant 's own case for asst years 2001-02to 2007-08 and asst.year 2008-09 it is held that there is nojustifiable basis for the addition on account of suppressed income ofrs.35,97,380/- in the asst.year 2000-01 and the said addition isdeleted and the ground raised on this issue is decided in favour ofthe appellant m/s balaji steel rolling mills pvt ltd. 16 m/s balaji steel rolling industries12.1 since facts are similar and action of the ao is also similar we do not see any reason to interfere with the order of the cit a for the detailed reasons stated above in the above revenueappeals there is no justifiable basis for making the addition andhence the same was correctly deleted by the ld.cit a in theresult this appeal is dismissed ita no 27/hyd/2013 13 in this case also the ao considered the earlier years ordersas a basis and arrived at the suppressed income atrs 40,75,988/- ld cit a vide his order dt 25-10-2012 deletedthe same by stating as under 14 after considering the rival contentions we do not see anyreason to uphold the revenue 's grounds for the detailed reasons m/s balaji steel rolling mills pvt ltd. 17 m/s balaji steel rolling industriesgiven above we agree with the order of the cit a that there is nobasis for making any addition accordingly the grounds arerejected in the result this appeal revenue is dismissed 15 one contention of the ld counsel in all the revenue appealsis that the additions can not be made in the proceedings u/s 153awhen there is no incriminating material he relied on the specialbench decision of all cargo global logistics ltd. vs. dcit 137itd 287 sb supra and also co-ordinate bench at bombay inthe case of acit vs. jayendra p. jhaveri 65 sot 118 mumbai uro supra however in view of the jurisdictional high courtjudgment in the case of gopal lal bhadruka vs. dcit 346 itr106 ap supra we are of the opinion that ao can take intoconsideration the material other than that available during thesearch and seizure operations for making an assessment of theundisclosed income of assessee on legal principles of abatementof assessments in some years even though there is merit inassessee 's contentions with reference to the proceedings u/s 153afor some of the impugned assessment years we find no reason togive any adjudication on this issue as the deletions made by thecit a on merits were upheld as there is no material at all to makethe additions in view of the confirmation of the cit a 's order inthe above appeals there is no need to adjudicate the legal groundsraised by assessee which are in support of the cit a 's order foracademic reasons m/s balaji steel rolling mills pvt ltd. assessee 's appeal in ita no 1555/hyd/2011 16 this appeal is by assessee is against the order of the cit a -i hyderabad dt 26-07-2011 as can be seen from the above m/s balaji steel rolling mills pvt ltd. 18 m/s balaji steel rolling industriesappeals of revenue three different cit a s have upheld assessee'scontentions and deleted additions whereas in this assessmentyear ld cit a confirmed the addition so made by stating thefollowing reasons had the advance received by the appellant being genuine the appellant would have produced the details of the payers for further verification the appellant failed to do so therefore i hold that m/s balaji steel rolling mills pvt ltd. 19 m/s balaji steel rolling industriesthere was no infirmity on the part of the ao in computing thesuppressed production which is fortified from the accounting entriesin the appellant 's books as other income being advance forfeited.the ao has scientifically worked out the suppressed productionand the suppressed income therefrom in fact the ao has also givencredit for the consumption of raw material that would have goneinto the suppressed production he has also given credit forexpenditure of rs.12 lakhs which in view is quite reasonable sincethe usual expenditure has already been booked by the appellantand debited to p l a/c even the burning loss at 10 allowed bythe ao is reasonable in fact in the case of srj peety steels whichis relied on by the appellant it is found that the burning lossreported in that case was as low as 1.73 to 2.46 accordingly the burning loss of 10 as allowed by the ao is definitelyreasonable and no interference is called for 04.1 the appellant has also relied on the decisions in the case ofroyal marwar tobacco products and in the case of srj peety steelsreferred to above in my view the case laws are distinguishablesince the main issue in those cases was whether the assessmentu/s 153a can be completed without any incriminating material onhand the assessment in the case under consideration wascompleted u/s 143 3 and not u/s 153a/153c further theassessing officer has heavily relied on the fact that the appellantitself has introduced cash in its books in the form of advanceforfeited which appellant also in a way agrees that it is salereceipts from sales not materialized thus the case laws relied onby the appellant is not squarely applicable in its case thus considering the totality of fact i confirm the method of computationof income arising out of suppressed production at rs.2,16 l1,739/-as worked out by the ao 05.0 the appellant contends that the expenditure incurred forsuppressed production is on the low side and needs revision nofurther explanation has been filed by the appellant as to how theexpenditure allowed by the ao over and above the normalexpenditure booked by the appellant in its books of etc is on thelower side as discussed earlier the ao has allowed 10 burningloss in addition to expenditure of 12 lakhs while working out thesuppressed income in view thereof i hold that the expenditureallowed by the ao is reasonable and does not call for anyinterference m/s balaji steel rolling mills pvt ltd. 20 m/s balaji steel rolling industries 17 this assessment is outside the search period ao has takenup the scrutiny u/s 143 3 however instead of examining thebooks of accounts of this year as seen from the assessment order ao listed out the so called seized material show cause noticesissued by the central excise authorities and the amounts offeredas incomes upto ay 2007-08 by way of forfeiture of advances inthe order and on similar lines arrived at the suppressed income atrs 2,16,11,739/- ld cit a as seen from the above order upheld the contentions of the ao for the reasons stated by him.however he has directed the ao to give credit to the other incomeadmitted by assessee in the books of accounts 18 after considering the rival contentions we do not see anyreason to uphold the order of the cit a and ao on the issue asin all the years decided above the addition is made on the basis ofthe presumptions and surmises without there being any evidenceleave alone any incriminating material order can not be upheldwhich was based on presumptions and surmises assessee'sobjections with reference to books of accounts have not beenrejected there is no incriminating material the report of spongeiron india ltd. can not be taken as basis has to be upheld asvalid since the assessment is not u/s 153a the legal objectionsraised by assessee are not applicable to the impugned assessmentyear but there is no evidence at all with ao and all otherauthorities like central excise and sales tax authorities have notmade out any case of surplus production or suppressed sales inthe absence of any evidence on record ao 's action can not beupheld there are no justifiable reasons for making the addition 19 to sum-up all the revenue appeals are dismissed andassessee 's appeal is
