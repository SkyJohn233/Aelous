Bright Energy Brighter Energy focuses on solar energy development for commercial, agricultural, and industrial customers with a deep understanding of the development process and how to maximize energy cost saving by optimizing project design, equipment selection, and project management. For customers who prefer third-party ownership with guaranteed savings, Brighter Energy works with a development partner who will fully finance and build the project so that the client pays only for the electricity produced at a fixed rate under a long-term power purchase agreement or lease structure. Brighter Energy currently has over 10 MW of solar projects in this category with interconnection agreements and ready for construction. To maximize savings for customers who prefer the benefits of owning their solar energy facilities, Brighter Energy has secured multiple USDA REAP grants for rural small business and agricultural producers. Let Brighter Energy use their experience and skills to evaluate whether solar energy can reduce your company’s electrical cost and environmental impact.
