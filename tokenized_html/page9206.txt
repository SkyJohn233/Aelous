rating american gods season 1 odin exposed a crazy leprechaun and a dead wife photo acquired courtesy of starz/ american gods photo acquired courtesy of starz/ american gods watching american gods first season was interesting because of the non-traditional storytelling a number of episodes began with the telling of an old god s story and usually in how they arrived in america which was also in the book sometimes we followed wednesday and shadow s journey other times we took a break to either showcase a character s backstory yet it didn t feel like it was enough perhaps that s not a terrible place to be but wanting more after this season finale actually left me disappointed let s take a look at what worked and what didn t in the first season of american gods fantastic acting the acting on american gods was top-notch from gillian anderson s terrific portrayals of four different iconic figures to ian mcshane s confusing and mysterious rendition of wednesday or better known as the god odin the acting was phenomenal you also can t forget about pablo schreiber s mad sweeney the rambunctious leprechaun filled with guilt or emily browning who plays a great dead wife the actors have made what is a little bit of confusing world fun and intriguing with the type of ensemble cast that american gods employs it could be difficult to get lost in the mix but each god has managed to make their time on-screen memorable departing from the novel american gods is not exact when it comes to adapting gaiman s novel and it works the show s writers have added new characters and filled in bigger back stories considering the novel was told from shadow s point of view it s been great to step outside of that window to get characters fleshed out there have been some characters that we only meet for a moment in the novel but play a bigger role on the show so far it has worked vulcan was new but poignant giving us something tangible in relation to the american gun culture his death was also used to manipulate easter ostara into fighting for the old god s. the additions/subtractions made a positive impact photo acquired courtesy of starz/ american gods unsatisfied ending we spent a full season eight episodes talking about a war between new and old gods a war is brewing but we never get to see it in fact wednesday and shadow have yet to make it to wisconsin where the battle is supposed to take place you couldn t really even call the ending a cliffhanger instead it felt like there were supposed to be more episodes on the way but we have to wait about a year to for season 2 according to deadline but at least we are getting a season 2 uneven storytelling the first season was a bit uneven we were introduced to characters only to never hear from them again perhaps they ll make an appearance for the war in season 2 there was a lot going on in season 1 sometimes a bit too much i am not sure if the season needed more or less episodes but eight didn t feel like the right number while wednesday and shadow spent much of the time traveling and meeting gods not much actually happened hopefully this means that next season will be filled with a bit more action and less of wednesday having to convince other gods to join his side let us know what you think about the first season of american gods in the comments by sooz by nivea serrao by disha mashelkar by sooz
