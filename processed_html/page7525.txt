Is Jolteon or Ampharos the better electric type Pokemon? | Yahoo Answers Please tell me which is better. I &# x27;m wondering which one I should train for my pokemon pearl game. And please don &# x27;t tell me I should choose Jolteon if I want this and I should choose Ampharos if I want that. I already know the pros and cons to each one. I &# x27;m looking for specific opinions. Also, please tell me which moves you would teach the pokemon you think I should train. By base stats: Jolteon: HP = 65 ATK = 65 DEF = 60 SP.ATK = 110 SP.DEF = 95 SPD = 130 TOTAL = 525 Ampharos HP = 90 ATK = 75 DEF = 75 SP.ATK = 115 SP.DEF = 90 SPD = 55 TOTAL = 500 Therefore: HP, ATK, DEF, SP.ATK Jolteon  <  Ampharos SP.DEF, SPEED, TOTAL Jolteon  >  Ampharos BY TIER: Jolteon  - OU (OverUsed) Ampharos - NU (NeverUsed) -_- Movesets: Jolteon  >  Ampharos Conclusion: I therefore conclude that you must prefer Jolteon than Ampharos. Though Ampharos has higher stats that Jolt, Jolt is more powerful in terms of movesets. Just use the highly recommended movesets for this. Well, hope I helped! Good Luck! [: BTW, for movesets, check out here: http://www.smogon.com/dp/pokemon/jolteon Lol I havent played Pokemon in a year.  But I believe that Jolteon is better.  Why?  It is because it has WAY better speed than Ampharos, and better Special Attack.  But the downside of Jolteon is that it doesn &# x27;t have good defense, special defense, or HP.  Jolteon can defeat a lot of types.  It can use dig to beat rock types and electric types.  It can use double kick to beat rock and ice types.  Pin Missile to beat psychic types.  And thunder moves to beat water.  So its obvious Jolteon is the better choice. idk wich is btr now because im 15 and i hadnt played pkmn for 9 yrs now but jolteon was way better back then
