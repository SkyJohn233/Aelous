racing games the 40 best games on android right now stuff namco s racer sits at the midpoint between asphalt 8 s demented arcade larks and real racing s overly earnest simulation leanings like its coin-op ancestors though ridge racer is still all about barreling along at insane speeds and having fun â€” you just have to work at success a bit more than in asphalt here driving like a total idiot will likely mean you ll lose a race instead you should only drive like a part-time maniac slipstreaming the opposition drifting through bends and boosting past rivals it looks great sounds suitably meaty controls really well and even the iap s subdued enough that the game won t constantly be doing wheelspins on your bank account download ridge racer slipstream a love letter to classic 1990s arcade racers horizon chase channels lotus turbo esprit challenge and top gear fusing them with a decidedly modern take on old-school visuals the result is an intoxicating and vibrant blast through 73 tracks located in 32 cities around the globe realism s broadly ignored in favour of speed as you battle from the back of the grid every time just like in the old days bumping rivals aside to try for the chequered flag the difficulty curve s smooth the soundtrack s head-noddingly cheesy and the game is fast you re basically dead inside if you don t plonk down the 200 bucks for the full-game unlock once you ve bested the initial handful of free tracks download horizon chase there are two ways to approach racing games you can try to recreate reality pretend you re crafting a simulation and make all of the tracks very grey or you can just go crazy asphalt takes the latter route having you zoom at breakneck speeds around ludicrous hyper-real city courses which occasionally catapult your car into the air in a manner that is totally not acceptable under your insurance plan the fast drift-happy racing is lots of fun and although the game s rather keen to relentlessly provide opportunities to convert real cash to in-game virtual cash there s not really any need to do so download asphalt 8 airborne imagine that little bird in tiny wings was a massive show-off on a bmx and that s more or less pumped bmx 3 you belt along increasingly insane tracks that would give any health and safety professional pause for thought pumping up slopes and then soaring into the air at that point it s all about the stunts and the not-crashing the former requires cunning flicks on a virtual joypad and taps of a spin button the latter s all down to timing and not being a ham-fisted buffoon when your little biker s ten metres in the air upside-down and about to discover how cruel gravity can be download pumped bmx 3 although not nearly as ramshackle as the excellent first entry in the series reckless racing 3 is a superb slice of overhead racing for reasons best known to the competitors you blaze around dodgy looking airports abandoned nuclear plants with neon waste worryingly spilled everywhere and serene mountaintop villages visually the game s a treat and although the physics is lightweight the handling s fine once you ve clocked it mostly though reckless succeeds due to its smart track design and in not taking anything that seriously and if there was ever a question about its sense of humour the game includes a gymkhana mode where you coax your car around complex courses like it was a metal horse download reckless racing 3
