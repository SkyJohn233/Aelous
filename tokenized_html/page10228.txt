link objective to investigate potential effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion csii compared with multiple daily injections mdi on glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus t1dm study design meta‐analysis and systematic review of randomized control studies rcts the electronic databases medline cochrane library and embase were searched through october 2007 results six rcts involving 165 participants with t1dm met our predefined inclusion criteria combined data from all trials showed that the csii group compared with the mdi group experienced a significant reduction in the level of glycosylated hemoglobin the pooled weighted mean difference wmd was −0.24 95 confidence interval 95 ci −0.41 to −0.07 p 0.001 with a fixed model and remained significant in the random effect model this effect was reached by slightly decreasing insulin requirement three rcts n 74 wmd −0.22 iu/kg/d 95 ci −0.31 to −0.14 p 0.001 no differences in the incidences of ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemic events were found conclusions in short‐term insulin therapy csii compared with mdi is a more effective form of metabolic control and allows reducing the daily insulin requirement yet no conclusions have been made so far whether this effect holds in later years these results should be approached with caution because of the methodological limitations of the analyzed studies the diabetes control and complications trial 1 provided conclusive evidence that strict glycemic control reduces the development and progression of late complications in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus t1dm optimal metabolic control requires replacement therapy that mimics the insulin profile seen in non‐diabetic people as closely as possible this form of insulin treatment also referred to as basal to bolus therapy can be administered with multiple daily injections mdi or with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion csii the latter treatment is a relevant therapeutic option in toddlers and preschool‐aged children 2 5 as well as in adolescents and adults with t1dm 6 7 the high precision of modern insulin pumps flexibility and easier adaptation of insulin dosing for current physiological needs enable to reduce the risk of severe hypoglycemia in children with t1dm 8 10 and improve glycemic control in adults 11 12 three meta‐analyses 13 15 published over the past 5 yr have shown the impact of csii therapy on metabolic control compared with mdi all confirmed that csii significantly improves the reduction in the glycosylated hemoglobin hba1c value they include trials of different study designs randomized and non‐randomized trials cohort studies and observational studies in addition different age‐groups 13 14 and patients with t1dm type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes 14 moreover all of them included studies published more than 5 yr ago and were not dedicated to the pediatric age‐group 13 15 no analysis is currently available with the results of randomized control trials rcts conducted in children with t1dm comparing the effect of csii with mdi on metabolic control as well as the safety and side effects of this treatment the aim of our study was therefore to investigate the potential effects of csii compared with mdi on glycemic control in children with t1dm we included parallel rcts or randomized crossover studies comparing csii therapy with mdi with a minimum 8‐wk study duration participants were children adolescents and young adults aged 1–21 yr with t1dm and minimum duration of diabetes of 3 months the primary outcome measure was glycemic control which was designated by the value of hba1c after the third month and the end of the study the secondary outcome measures were as follows a change in hba1c from baseline until the end of the study total insulin dose per kilogram per day at the end of the study severe hypoglycemia rates diabetic ketoacidosis rates therapy discontinuation rates z‐score body mass index bmi at the end of the study and quality of life qol in addition to these outcomes we made an a priori decision to extract other data reported by investigators if they were found to be relevant for this review the following electronic databases were systematically searched for relevant studies medline 1966–january 2007 the cochrane database of systematic reviews issue 4 2006 and the cochrane controlled trials register issue 4 2006 embase 1980–january 2007 this search was updated in october 2007 furthermore reference lists from original studies and review articles were identified no limit was imposed regarding the language of publication but certain publication types i.e. letters to the editor abstracts and communications from scientific meetings minutes of scientific meetings were excluded the text‐word terms and mesh headings used were diabetes diabetes mellitus type 1 insulin‐dependent diabetes insulin continuous subcutaneous infusion continuous subcutaneous injection csii pump therapy intensive insulin therapy multiple daily injections mdi flexible multiple daily insulin fmdi msi children child* newborn infant* teenagers teenag* adolescent* titles and abstracts identified in accordance with the search strategy described above were screened independently by two reviewers all potentially relevant articles were retained and full texts of the studies were examined to determine which of them satisfied the inclusion criteria data extraction was carried out independently by all reviewers using standard data extractions only studies published in the form of complete peer‐reviewed publications were included in addition to the electronic search we checked out cross‐references from the original articles and reviews in the case of studies in which results were expressed in figures but not in numbers we contacted the authors for clarification we contacted multiple authors 16 20 and finally two researches answered our queries 18 20 data from crossover studies for both periods were combined as both arms were separated by a 2‐wk run‐in washout period carryover as an effect of treatment during the first period in these two studies was minimized discrepancies between the reviewers were resolved by discussion the reviewers independently but without disregarding the authorship or the journal of publication assessed the quality of studies meeting the inclusion criteria the use of the following strategies associated with good quality studies was assessed i allocation concealment ii blinding of investigators iii participants iv outcome assessors and data analysts yes/no and v comprehensive follow‐up allocation concealment was considered adequate when the randomization method used did not allow the investigator or participants to identify or influence the intervention group before eligible participants were enrolled in the study however the quality of allocation concealment was considered unclear when randomization was used but no information about the method was available and inadequate when inappropriate methods of randomization e.g. alternate medical record numbers unsealed envelopes and tossing the coin were used with regard to the intention‐to‐treat itt analysis a yes answer meant that the authors had specifically reported undertaking this type of analysis and/or that our own study confirmed it was the case conversely a no answer meant that authors did not report the use of an itt analysis and/or that we could not confirm its use at study assessment to evaluate the completeness of patient follow‐up we determined the percentage of participants excluded or lost to follow‐up the data were analyzed using review manager 4.2.10 version date 13 november 2006 the cochrane collaboration the weighted mean difference wmd between the treatment and the control groups was selected to represent the difference in continuous outcomes because of a limited amount of data we did not test for publication bias the difference between study groups was considered significant when the p value was 0.05 or when the 95 confidence interval 95 ci for wmd did not exceed 0 equivalent to p 0.05 the weight given to each study was based on variance inversion we assessed heterogeneity between trials using the chi‐squared test and i 2 which represents the percentage of total variations between studies that are attributed to heterogeneity rather than chance we initially selected eight articles 16 23 table 1 summarizes the characteristics of trials qualified for review six rcts 17 19 21 23 involving 165 participants 81 in the experimental group and 84 in the control group met our predefined inclusion criteria the two remaining studies were excluded 16 20 in brief one study was excluded because it was not rct the second excluded trial was rct but performed in children and adults and input data for children were not analyzed separately the mean age of participants varied from 1.7 to 21 yr the duration of the intervention ranged from 6 to 12 months two studies were crossover trials 19 20 the trials differed in methodological quality table 1 three trials used an adequate method of generating the randomization scheme the method used in the remaining four trials was unclear all trials were described as open‐label trials an adequate description of itt analysis was provided in only two rcts all trials included an adequate number of participants in the final analysis all six rcts 17 19 21 23 provided data on glycemic control described by the hba1c value at the end of the study in one study 17 data were available only in graphs and with no response to our request for crude data they could not be pooled in the meta‐analysis the pooled results of five trials n 136 showed a significant lower hba1c value in group treated with csii compared with mdi group wmd −0.24 95 ci −0.41 to −0.07 p 0.001 fig 1 the studies that qualified for

deviation score sds or percentile for age we could not pool the results for a meta‐analysis dimeglio et al n 37 did not observed significant difference between groups in bmi percentile for age at the end of the study 18 in contrast weintrob et al 22 found a significantly higher bmi sds in the group treated with mdi compared with patients treated with csii one rct n 23 mean difference 0.35 ± 0.83

hypoglycemic episodes were established based on continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring as well as self‐monitoring of blood glucose wilson et al 17 dimeglio et al 18 doyle et al 19 and weintrob et al 22 analyses found less episodes of severe hypoglycemia sh with csii than with mdi 4 vs. 10 two episodes of ketoacidosis were reported by fox et al 21 and doyle et al 19 in the csii group and no dka

satisfaction with treatment and psychoemotional condition of the parents were assessed in four rcts n 98 17 19 21 22 table 2 because of differences in the age and maturity of the study subjects as well as the various forms of diabetes qol questionnaires used the results were analyzed separately in one of the studies no description of the tool used to assess the qol was provided in the study by weintrob et al 22 a comparison of results at the end of the study showed a significantly higher level of satisfaction with treatment in patients treated with csii this was the only study to provide the total score for both groups at the end of the study 30.6 ± 3.7 vs. 21.9 ± 3.8 p 0.001 without any significant difference in the impact worry or satisfaction subscales wilson et al 17 noticed an improvement in qol from baseline until the end of the study in the group treated with csii compared with the mdi group δdqol −0.24 ± 0.25 vs. −0.08 ± 0.19 p 0.03 but they did not compare the two groups at the end of the observation only fox et al 21 assessed qol separately for the father and the mother the authors found that the mothers of patients on mdi reported a greater impact of diabetes on the family life than those of patients on pumps moreover the fathers of children in the mdi group reported significantly higher scores on the stress index the total score was not provided in this study no difference in the pediatric diabetes qol between the two groups was reported in doyle et al 19 study the modified for youth the diabetes qol questionnaire was implemented which was filled out by the half of the study population there was no difference in total scores investigators in two rcts n 41 reported that all participants opted for continuation of the pump therapy at the end of the study 17 21 in the dimeglio et al 18 study 19 of 20 families continued the csii treatment weintrob et al 22 reported that 16 of 23 patients from both the control and the experimental groups decided to switch to pumps the principal conclusion from this meta‐analysis is that csii is more effective than mdi in getting lower value of the hba1c in children with t1dm this difference of hba1c was 0.24 but it was statistically relevant findings were stable with both fixed and random effect models this effect of lower hba1c with csii than with mdi was observed at 3 months of study duration as well as at the end of intervention interestingly only one 19 of the six rcts analyzed separately showed a significantly lower hba1c in csii group compared with mdi group other potential benefits of the csii therapy included a relatively low compared with the control insulin requirement without any tendency toward changes in bmi 18 19 22 patients who had received csii therapy compared with patients on mdi had low rate of ketoacidosis severe hypoglycemic events and also had improved qol the results of presented meta‐analysis is consistent with the consensus statement from the european society for paediatric endocrinology espe the lawson wilkins pediatric endocrine society and the international society for pediatric and adolescent diabetes ispad concerning csii in children with t1dm presented by phillip et al 24 the performed meta‐analysis adds category a evidence into this recommendation all trials suffered from limited sample sizes moreover methodological limitations included unclear randomization methods and lack of itt analysis an additional limitation is the lack of data concerning standard deviations in hba1c changes in one study 17 hba1c values were only presented on a graph and consequently had to be excluded from this analysis moreover in spite of direct requests some authors failed to provide the required information because of differences in the presentation of body weight bmi z‐score bmi sds and bmi in percentile for age and gender we could not meta‐analyze the impact of the intervention on growth or development the lack of a standard qol questionnaire for the parents of preschool children made it difficult to carry out an objective assessment three studies 17 18 21 were conducted in young children but with different questionnaires furthermore the measured outcomes were not presented in all studies making it difficult to analyze the data this included for example poor presentation of data about insulin doses or physical development moreover studies included in this analysis were conducted for no longer than 12 months most of them were carried out for period of 3 or 6 months although this meta‐analysis shows a better metabolic control regarding the value of hba1c with csii it does not allow to predict the impact of csii method on metabolic control in longer period of treatment the findings of this meta‐analysis suggest that a qol questionnaire should be developed for the parents of preschool children even though qol is one of the most important parameters it has thus far been difficult to assess objectively this is because no standard qol questionnaire has been developed for the parents of small children that would take into account the impact of the disease satisfaction with treatment or the parents anxiety level also larger sample sizes are necessary the fact that this analysis has shown that individual controlled studies have not demonstrated any statistically significant difference in hba1c levels between patients receiving csii and mdi may have been because of the insufficient number of patients enrolled only one trial with the participation of adolescent patients was conducted no trials over a period of more than 12 months have been carried out to assess the impact of treatment not only on metabolic control but also on the incidence of severe hypoglycemic events the child s emotional development the incidence of depression anorexia and the ability to take on independent employment in adult life the analysis gives light on the methodology of study like a necessity of presentation primary end‐points in absolute values with standard deviation moreover it is necessary to standardize physical development parameters taking into account the dynamics of changes resulting from the child s development as well as population‐related and gender‐related differences five of the six rcts taken separately did not show any improvement in glycemic control in patients treated with pumps compared with mdi however this meta‐analysis of rcts indicates that csii therapy is a more effective form of insulin therapy compared with traditional mdi in short period of treatment this method does not increase the risk of dka the low rates of discontinuation indicate that pump therapy is preferred by children volume 10 issue 1 february 2009 pages 52-58 the full text of this article hosted at
