He stays in the Cyclops’s cave which causes some of his men to die.  This is selfish because even though they beg him to leave, he decides that his curiosity about what the Cyclops is like is more important than everybody’s safety.  He is only thinking about himself while a good leader would be thinking about his men. Then he doesn’t tell his men about Scylla so that he can live even though they will die.  This shows how selfish he is in protecting his own life.  He knows if he tells them, the men will try to save their own lives, but he thinks his life is more important so he does what is best for Odysseus.  Last, he stays with Circe for a long time so that he can have an affair.  This is selfish because his men try to get him to leave Circe’s island and go home.  He doesn’t care that he is keeping everybody away from home, even though as the leader he is supposed to be making sure all his men return home safely. So although he is brave and strong, Odysseus is selfish and not a great leader. {    "@context": "http://schema.org",    "@type": "ImageObject",    "contentUrl": "https://slideplayer.com/slide/9358608/28/images/6/In+The+Odyssey%2C+by+Homer%2C+the+main+character+Odysseus+is+not+a+great+leader+because+he+is+selfish..jpg",    "name": "In The Odyssey, by Homer, the main character Odysseus is not a great leader because he is selfish.",    "description": "He stays in the Cyclops’s cave which causes some of his men to die.
