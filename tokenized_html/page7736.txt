lagna is placed in the 12th from arudha lagna the 2/12 axis is not favorable for compatibility between the partners it shows that he may reject the spouse and not be emotionally or physically in harmony with her need for affection and attention dosha girl has mars in the 12th and boy has mars in the 12th too they are both manglik two people who are manglik in marriage cancels the dosha
