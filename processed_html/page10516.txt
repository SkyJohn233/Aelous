'Throw the bastards out': an American tradition from settlers to Trump | US news | The Guardian The more unflinchingly Trump preaches, the more it clicks with the national creed and the more satisfying it feels. There’s a reason for that: it’s part of the fabric of American history The more unflinchingly Trump preaches, the more it clicks with the national creed and the more satisfying it feels. There’s a reason for that: it’s part of the fabric of American history Marcia Pally Thu 8 Sep 2016  06.00 EDT Last modified on Fri 9 Feb 2018  14.08 EST This past summer, I was guest-teaching in Europe. When the talk of the town wasn’t Brexit, it was the US election. It was discussed the way you’d discuss an alien invasion: bizarre. A look at US history, however, suggests that this election is far from unusual, and that Donald Trump’s populist, anti-Washington cry to Make America Great Again emerges from the foundational belief of many early settlers: that they were the chosen ones who saw corruption and fought it, building a world cleansed of its sins. This ethos embodies what  Jean-Jacques Rousseau  called “civil religion” – that is, the features that undergird political, social and economic behavior. In America’s case, the sociologist Robert Bellah described the country’s civil religion through its symbols: the Exodus, Chosen People, Promised Land, New Jerusalem, and Sacrificial Death and Rebirth.  These optimistic, populist, and nativist traditional underpinnings help explain why Americans think about politics as they do: we bring a good deal of fervor to these symbols. Our country’s most pressing issues – from purchasing power stagnation to  rust belt  job loss – tend to be concrete and measurable. But solutions, as they project into the future, are a matter of belief. Americans – heir to people so devout they crossed an ocean to stay true to principle – have faith in what will save the day. It’s “the economy, stupid” when it comes to describing problems. When it comes to solutions, beliefs count. The main issue facing voters can be summed up by the significant drop in upward mobility. America is  the most unequal  of all western nations: our “Gini” (inequality) index is 85.1, in line with Chile’s 81.4, India’s 81.3, Indonesia’s 82.8, and Kazakhstan’s 86.7. The top 20% of households own over 84% of the wealth; the bottom 40% own 0.3%. In both the working and middle classes, people feel sidelined or fear their children soon will be.  Such are the problems agreed upon by voters across the political spectrum, from Sanders backers to Trump supporters. In coming to solutions, Americans bring fervor particularly to what Bellah described as Sacrificial Death and Rebirth. This includes not only a future orientation, rebirth and “start anew!”, but death to the old and decayed.  The Christian narrative of crucifixion and resurrection and the national tale of leaving the old world have anchored the story of Death and Rebirth in the American civil creed. In it, we hear echoes of the preacher’s “rid ye of the devil” and traces of the political call to “throw the bastards out”. This election year, it’s clearest in the Trump campaign but emerges in alternative form in Democratic positions. Populist demands grow loud when the “bastards” are identified as Washington insiders, constrainers of liberties, corrupt and incompetent. Nativist demands increase when the “bastards” are immigrants or other suspect groups. In both, a troubled world will be set right when evil forces are purged. The country was born in a revolution against central government, but long before, early settlers, fleeing the centralization of Charles I, were wary of London: the king’s men were the bastards to be thrown out in order to preserve local control. “The Congregational churches and self-contained towns of Massachusetts,” the historian TH Breen writes, “stood as visible evidence of the founders’ decision to preserve in America what had been threatened in the mother country.”  The many early settlers who were religious dissenters were doubly suspicious of government, first for its centralizing efforts and second for the persecution it had foisted upon them. Internal migration through sparsely settled land contributed to the dismissal of central government and growing self-reliance, as there was relatively little government to rely on. Individual initiative and local community were the keys to survival.  National government took a larger role as the country grew, yet the value of individual and local effort combined with a suspicion of central authorities were rooted in America’s civil faith. Protestantism, born also in revolution (against Rome), added to the mix. The mandate to read the Bible for oneself and find one’s own path to God encouraged the view that the responsible moral agent is the individual (with guidance from her local church). The Great Awakenings of the 1730s-1740s and 1820s-50s were festivals of individual iconoclasm, religious groups splintering off from established institutions, and populist religious ideas. Reformed Protestantism, which came to America through Puritan and other Calvinist traditions, had an even stronger impact on political development. It held that the sovereign nation does not start with central government but with the local covenanted community – the foedus – which form networks to constitute the nation. It’s these ideas that gave the US its federal system of government and the continuing political and legal battles about states’ rights.  During the revolution, America’s churches sided with the rebels, not London. Among the more anti-authoritarian sects was Arminianism – or in America, Methodism – in which the accent shifted subtly to the individual’s role in salvation. It was a faith well-suited to a self-reliant nation wary of authorities, and America embraced it. The number of Methodist churches rose from 20 in 1770 to 19,883 in 1860. By the mid-19th century, two Kentucky preachers could in good anti-authoritarian conscience opine: “We are not personally acquainted with the writings of John Calvin … neither do we care.” When Reagan said government was the problem, he was channeling American history and zeal From this history came the myth, reality and creed of self-reliant localism and suspicion of central authority. Reliance on government is for the faint and faithless of heart. When Reagan said government was the problem, he was channelling American history and zeal.  Today, Trump is giving this civil religion voice in populist form, and because “throw the bastards out” is rooted in US culture and worldview, it wins votes.  In April 2016, the Public  Religion  Research Institute reported: “Two-thirds of Trump supporters think the nation needs a leader who breaks the rules” (a ritual redux of Boston’s “throw the bastards out” Tea Party). Other Republican candidates had populist, small-government positions but lacked Trump’s feathers-and-warpaint yelp. Ted Cruz came closest, which is one reason, along with his social conservatism, why he was second in line and why there is substantial support for his running in 2020. Even when Trump says he’d keep governmental social security for retirees, his jeremiad is brimstone and hellfire for Washington. The more unflinchingly Trump preaches, the more it “clicks” with the national creed and the more satisfying it feels. Trump University taught: “You don’t sell products, benefits or solutions – you sell feelings.” Trump had no hand in the development of America’s civil-religious anti-authoritarian feelings, but he taps into them. His first and continuing charge against Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine is that they are “ultimate insiders”. In nativist form, “rid ye of the devil” is extended from the populist Satan of big government to other spoilers of the City on the Hill, especially traditionally suspect groups like immigrants and Muslims. Many factors go into antipathy against these communities, and surveys have correlated support for Trump with pre-existing intolerance for immigrants, racial minorities, and Muslims. But intolerance becomes calls for deportation and border closings where “throw the devil out” is seen as the way to save a fallen world.  One definition of “tragic” is getting behind solutions that don’t solve problems. Closing borders to keep or throw the bastards out will probably not address America’s economic or national security problems. Given the extensive vetting process, it’s not clear that barring Muslims will boost security, but it does do Isis’s PR for them, giving weight to the claim that America is in a war against all Muslims. It’s also not clear that reducing immigration would yield economic benefits, since legal and illegal immigrants to the US create companies and jobs and boost the economy by a surplus of $35bn annually, benefiting all but the lowest earners.  America’s employment crisis could be addressed through education, job (re)training, and regional redevelopment, for a start. But these options lack the satisfaction of “ride ’em out of town”.  What of Clinton and the year-long outpouring of support for Sanders? Though they occupy different positions on the Democratic spectrum, they, like Obama, preach America’s alternative gospel: government is not the devil that should be kept as small as possible; instead, it should be large enough to give the little guy a leg-up. The Clinton platform builds on the Roosevelt Institute’s policy recommendations that government “rewrite the rules” for broad-based distribution of resources. This American gospel too believes in “cast out the old to build the new”. Obama, after all, also campaigned on “Change” in the American civil creed idiom. But this alternative “change” and creed sees government as the agent responsible for maintaining opportunities for ordinary people and for ensuring that the middle class is the largest class, which it is no longer.  The economic tsunami of 2008 has added to the problems that have been accumulating since the 1980s – not only purchasing power stagnation but the fear that it will worsen. America is in a civil-religious war about its response. Rid-ye-of the-devil’s-government remains America’s first and oldest civil religion. It faces the newer “leg up” creed. Seventy-two percent of Democrats and those leaning Democratic see a major role for the government in lifting people out of poverty; only 36% of Republicans do. Eighty-two percent of Democrats see government as having a major role to play in healthcare; only 34% of Republicans do. The apostles of each creed, like the circuit-rider preachers who traversed America, cross the country today with their campaign staffs, hoping to save the nation.  Marcia Pally teaches multilingual multicultural studies at New York University. Her latest book is Commonwealth and Covenant: Economics, Politics, and Theologies of Relationality … in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation. Democracy is under attack, as is civility, truth and normal forms of political behaviour. The White House harbours white nationalists, incites fear and prejudice, undermines intelligence agencies, courts foreign influence in US elections and undermines the judiciary. The need for a robust, independent press has never been greater and with your help we can continue to provide fact-based reporting that offers public scrutiny and oversight.  These are perilous times. The administration ' s willingness to deploy untruths, violent speech and hateful attacks on the media are now commonplace. This is why we are asking for your help so that we can continue to put truth and civility at the heart of the public discourse.  " Next year America faces an epic choice – and the result could define the country for a generation. It is at a tipping point, finely balanced between truth and lies, hope and hate, civility and nastiness. Many vital aspects of American public life are in play – the Supreme Court, abortion rights, climate policy, wealth inequality, Big Tech and much more. The stakes could hardly be higher. As that choice nears, the Guardian, as it has done for 200 years, and with your continued support, will continue to argue for the values we hold dear – facts, science, diversity, equality and fairness. "  – US editor, John Mulholland On the occasion of its 100th birthday in 1921 the editor of the Guardian said,  " Perhaps the chief virtue of a newspaper is its independence. It should have a soul of its own. "  That is more true than ever. Freed from the influence of an owner or shareholders, the Guardian ' s robust independence is our unique driving force and guiding principle.  We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. We hope to surpass our goal by early January. Every contribution, big or small, will help us reach it.  Make a year-end gift from as little as $1. Thank you.

Um, no. Member of community != stranger. A community of tribes is a social experiment The meme that wealth inequality is cause of americas problems not racism does not ring true as racism is applied on top of wealth inequality to hold people down. When poor whites become heroin addicts it is called a social problem not a crime as prison slavery makes up its quotas and profits from blacks and bent police and courts Hillary will give a voice to BlackLivesMatter Trump will feed climate of hate against immigrants  blacks will never subscribe to Trump  immigrant hate is new platform for racists in EU US Australia NZ Israel and other white lands The 43% of the 1% in the US are not white, they are Middle Eastern. On top of that, the average income of Asian-Americans is higher than European-Americans. Americans are lying perverts with bent statistics white privilege applies to all whites not 1% 100% only reason socialism is despised is it would help blacks and minorities  USA capitalism failed when recession hit whites minorities have always been in recession You must be an alt-right white out of sight nobody a troll surfing extremist sites ready for battle for Trump trash Great article! Trump doesn ' t have universal appeal though. His support is amongst a subset of the Republican faithful. Whatever ' s happening it doesn ' t feel like a continuation of the history described in this article. Because Trump represents everything about the Establishment: a wealthy one percenter who happily pays for favors. He ' s said so himself many times:  " As a businessman and a very substantial donor to very important people, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do. " Trump ' s not leading a revolution, or even a mob. He ' s using a group of disillusioned people to acquire power and prestige amongst his Establishment peers. Republican  &  Democrat have ceased to mean anything. They should be renamed The Sort-of-Sane Party, and The Dixiecrat Fruitcake Party. A new, pertinent name for each election. If you think they offer the same you ' re not paying attention. Good point. Such a big disconnect between both parties and large segments of their supporters and the public in general. Then they decide to give the electorate these two choices for President. No wonder so many folks wanting to opt out entirely. Obama deported how many? 2,5 million? Yet here we are, bashing republicans. Vote Trump! Vote Dumb, did you say? You Clintonians are getting so desperate the only thing left to do is call him names, right. Keep at it, but do know the majority of right minded America will vote Trump as president, not La Clinton. If even Obama is better at deporting people as you suggest, why would you need Trump? everyone ' s an immigrant from somewhere [except maybe australian aborigines]. trump and his redneck followers can bugger off for starters. look at what they did to 1st nations peoples, besides africans; they are the bedrock of awfulness but would sweden want them back, given they are none to bright and have more in common with anders brevik than  ' normal '  folk? Trump is a 3rd generation German immigrant. Breivik is Norwegian. Most of the early European settlers in North America were from the British Isles, Spain and France. The First Australians came out of Africa, the same as the rest of us. Sweden had, and has, little to nothing to do with this. Your totally off the wall maundering makes a person wonder what the devil you are, unless you ' re a troll, in which case you don ' t deserve being paid for it. Australian aborigines are obviously immigrants. Okay, from 50-60,000 years ago but they didn ' t spring from the Australian soil, the Garden of Eden near Woollongong or evolve from koalas. Donald Trump’s populist, anti-Washington cry to Make America Great Again emerges from the foundational belief of many early settlers: that they were the chosen ones who saw corruption and fought it, building a world cleansed of its sins. Sorry, no. So, you rather vote for a woman with a history of waging war, now planning to start world war 3 with Russia? You think that is clever? Hillary isn ' t planning a war with Russia. Trump is increasing the military and preparing for a Vietnam like operation in the Middle East. Hillary announced to the world that she will never put troops on the ground. (So much for keeping all options open...) Her fealty to the progressive disdain for anything military might be a finger in the wind nod to her base, but at some point it is going to bump into the reality of some truly hostile enemies. The problem with the  " throw the bastards out "  philosophy is that you do end up having to replace those bastards. And then the replacements become bastards themselves.  The entire midterm election of 2010 was based on that same rallying cry. The Tea Party was at its peak and they were voted in with the mission of righting all the wrongs of their predecessors.  And then what happened? The Tea Party did, essentially, nothing. There was no Congressional revolution, and they were as ineffective as the people they replaced. See, it ' s not so easy to govern, in reality. There must be some common goals, common ground and common sense. Unfortunately, all of these are in short supply among politicians. Most are self-serving, at their core, regardless of their party affiliation. So, while the urge to truly clean house might resurface among voters every election season, all that ends up hapening is that we rearrange the furniture a little instead. It does not do us any good at the end of the day. You did not need so many words: Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard. H. L. Mencken And that is exactly what a Trump presidency would do .... Absolutely nothing. And if the right wing nuts supporting him think he will give a fig about them once he is (God forbid) in, they are more disillusioned than ever expected. And then what happened? The Tea Party did, essentially, nothing. There was no Congressional revolution, and they were as ineffective as the people they replaced.  See, it ' s not so easy to govern, in reality. There must be some common goals, common ground and common sense.  therefore all we need is more negotiations and problems will be solved? why did not anyone think of that before? i can assure you, the rich love liberals like you. small brain, easy to control! I grew up in a part of Canada settled by refugees forced out of the USA after their Revolution. Come on Mike. Sure some Loyalists left because they felt threatened but a lot left (at least for a while) because of their loyalty to England. The second large influx of Americans was after the Civil War. And a smaller one during the Vietnam War. And persons are interested today in doing so. From the US, besides Loyalists, Underground Railroad ran all the way into Canada. Indentured white servants, some of whom were also raped, beaten, starved to death. Crack open a few history books, ThePaSkeptic. ' The country was born in a revolution against central government ' Thing is, kingdoms are ruled by kings, empires are ruled by emperors and countries are ruled by...go figure. Well the US has been ruled by Europe ' s rejects.  And yes they are c... MaliklaM, So you have seen the movie Stripes? And you know America is proud to be ruled by people that would be rejected by Europe. To be fair the Europe of the 18th Century were a bit different then the Europe of today. From Stripes: " We ' re all very different people. We ' re not Watusi, we ' re not Spartans, we ' re Americans. With a capital  " A " , huh? And you know what that means? Do you? That means that our forefathers were kicked out of every decent country in the world. We are the wretched refuse. We ' re the underdog. We ' re mutts.
