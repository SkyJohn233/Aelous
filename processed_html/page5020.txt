Bead Patterns and Ideas : Lace Lanterns Necklace Pattern Designs by Sandra D Halpenny  Beautiful... I will try. Thank you for share I can see this with the new tiny oval crystals Swarovski recently came out with in place of the lantern beads! What a knock-out necklace! This is lovely!  Can anyone give me an idea of how many 6mm beads are required? As in #beads used in a 2 "  section? Just downloaded this and looked through it. The diagrams are clear and instructions well written. Thank you, Sandra, for writing this and providing it for free! I love this! I am new to bead work.  I am thinking it could be adapted to make a lamp shade for my doll house. Could you please tell me what thread you use. Think this looks very Doable!  Gonna try it today. Will be using 6mm crystals instead of lantern beads,
