Very well. Heath understood immediately what I needed, gave me a quote on the spot, took a sample for color matching, and replaced the damaged shutters within a day or so (I don't remember exactly). I would definitely hire him again. Repaired blinds where part went up and the other part went down when you pulled the string Called and left message; Dave returned the call later that day.  He could have swung by that evening (about 6pm) but we were busy so we made an appointment 2 days out.  He arrived promptly, did a great job.  It was $55 for him to remove the 4 foot blind and re-do the string, rehand the blind and then put the rail back on (I had taken it off to see if I could see any broken strings).  Very professional, great job.  I loved that I didn't have to take the blinds down myself and haul them someplace -- especially as these blinds are big and difficult for me to take off and put on.  I would use his services again if I needed blind repair. Dave replaced the tract of my vertical blinds. Dave thoroughly explained why one of the blind panels was not rotating when trying to open  &  close the blinds. He quoted how much it would cost to replace versus repair the situation. My blinds are inexpensive so it made more sense to replace the tract. I called Monday. He gave me a free estimate that day. The replacement was done that Wednesday. Replaced all clips and gears that held the vertical blind slats on a 4 foot track.  Approximately 20 in all.   Dave attempted to repair the two broken clips in home but the gearing mechanism that swivel the slats were also broken.  He removed the entire tract and repaired it off site, REPLACING ALL OF THE CLIPS.   I received a call the following day stating the fix had been completed.  He was here to re-install the tract with in 15 mins after the phone call.  Dave was pleasant, professional, and prompt keeping set appointment's.  His work is of high quality and his work ethic is second to none. The work site was clean after completion of the job.  I will be installing wood shutters in the future and of course I will not hesitate to give him a call, he's that good.  So if your looking for a repair person STOP, LOOK NO MORE YOU HAVE FOUND HIM!  I recommend him highly and he will always be welcomed in my house.    He fixed a bedroom vertical blind and replaced the rods to open  &  close wood horizontal blinds. It went well. he got lost coming to the house so it took him a little longer. its been 3 months and no complaints from my tenants so it seems all is well. Only negative comment is I asked for a emailed receit and I never received one. Repaired a few loose shutters and also made three new slats for family room shutters. Very well, Dave is very dependable and did great work! I called Dave this past November 2013. My middle Arcadia door plantation blind had broken right when my new tile was going in. I will say that he came right out  &  removed the blind so that the tile installers could do their work. He could not find the part that was needed so did not use his services, Other than his help removing the shutter, cannot comment. Based on other reviews he des a good job. This client had broken parts that were discontinued and could not wait until a substitute part was located and obtained. I spent countless hours on-line to locate the part. Several times vendors shipped me the incorrect part. When I finally obtained the correct part, I became ill with the flu. She has decided to move on. Repaired broken shutters Prompt phone answer and appointment schedule Arrive on time, reviewed shutters to be repaired. Advised what needed to be done, process and commenced work. Found some additional issues and showed me before repairing. Completed repairs, cleaned up the work area and explained the billing in detail. Dave replaced 29 magnets and tightened shutters throughout the house. Dave was professional, worked quickly, and took great care in making sure that our shutters were operating properly. We will definitely use him again. Carpet installer did not re-hang shutters correctly.    Unable to close properly.  Also replaced 9 magnetic clips Excellent work.  HIghly recommend.   We are selling a home long distance and needed someone to fix the shutters.   The repairs were part of the closing agreement and we needed to find someone quickly..  Dave was responsive, honest and very affordable.
