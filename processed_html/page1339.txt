Israeli  &  Jewish Militaria : Belgian Army British mk II helmet shell, circa. 1949-51 w/Belgian tricolor Belgian Army mark II (mkII) helmet shell, circa. 1949-51,  in khaki color. The helmet is not maker-marked, bears the Belgian tricolors on one side, and though missing the liner, it has the Belgian neck strap and rivets bolted to the strap hoops. The tricolor is painted and is not a decal. In excellent condition, with a few scuffs to the finish (but not to the shell). The Belgian Army used British-made helmets during and right after the war; in 1949, Belgium produced such British-styled mark II's on her own and fitted them with domestically produced liners, and these in turn were replaced in 1951 by the NATO modelled helmets. מילות מפתח:  מיליטריה מיליטאריה כסדה בריטית מלהע"ם 2 צבא בלגיה 2019 Historama | Online History Shop           Site design by  Studio 42 web design
