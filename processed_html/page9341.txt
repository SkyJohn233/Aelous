It was drooping and I thought about asking for another one but looked at how beautiful and brilliant the red rose was. I put the stem between the pages of my book and continued my journey. On the next leg of my journey, I thought about putting it in water, but I didn't. When I arrived home, I picked out a beautiful vase with my name on it , filled it with water and cut a little of the stem off and nestled  the rest inside. This morning, I looked at the Rose and it was standing up on its' own looking as radiate. Now radiance is my new memory of Kathleen Mulholland.
