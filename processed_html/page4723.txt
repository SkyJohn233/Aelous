About Salient is an excellent design with a fresh approach for the ever-changing Web. Integrated with Gantry 5, it is infinitely customizable, incredibly powerful, and remarkably simple. The Combined Municipal Campaign allows city employees to demonstrate their strong sense of community by supporting environmental, health and social welfare issues that concern the citizens of Houston. The annual fundraising drive, which is throughout the month of October, is run by city employees as a way for city employees to give to charitable organizations of their choice. Thousands of people have been helped by the organizations represented in the campaign. The generosity of city employees improves conditions and demonstrates the power of the collective dollar and its far-reaching impact. "Thank you for touching lives through your generosity. Every day, because of the caring hearts of friends like you, we see lives changed as Houstonians begin to live the life God has planned for them and return to work to support their families."
