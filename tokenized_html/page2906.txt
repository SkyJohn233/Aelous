since fenway first hosted the national hockey league s winter classic back in 2010 crews have prepped the stadium for a series of hockey contests both the harvard men and women have played at fenway with the men losing 2‒0 to union college back in 2012 and the women dropping their game against boston college by a score of 3‒1 in 2017 despite playing their game in rainy conditions that forced them to negotiate large puddles women s team forwards lexie laing 19 and bradley fusco 19 who both assisted on the crimson s goal said the experience was one of the highlights of their harvard careers we live in such a historic town the city of champions one that features both great professional and collegiate teams explained fusco who grew up in nearby winchester to be able to connect the two and to represent a great college program in the stadium of the world champions of major league baseball a team that i watched growing up and to do so in front of my whole family was incredibly special. it was such a unique experience added laing who got to spend time on the ice that day with both of her older sisters brianna 17 who was harvard s goalie and former professional hockey player denna who dropped the first puck the whole atmosphere was different it was colder being outside the stadium lights were on even the way the sounds echoed throughout the stadium was something i d never experienced before and of course the weather. to me all of these environmental factors let you let loose and appreciate the game you know that you were playing hockey in front of the green monster said fusco i agree said laing it reminded us of why we play hockey. the harvard and boston college women s hockey teams clash on the ice at fenway in 2017 harvard athletics photos according to football captain and fifth-year senior zach miller a similar excitement is mounting within the team as it prepares to take on yale in the game i m looking forward to enjoying my last moments on the football field with these guys in the locker room he said i ve grown up with these guys matured a lot with them over the past 4½ years … getting to go out with these guys on such a historic date in such a historic way with the harvard-yale game by itself and then doing it at fenway it s going to be awesome for us. former teammate ben abercrombie who was paralyzed in his first game with the crimson last fall will be back on campus in the lead-up to the game and he plans to spend time with his fellow players this is the first time that ben has been back to harvard since he was injured against the university of rhode island almost 15 months ago said head coach tim murphy it s a big weekend for ben and his family and it s a big weekend for our football team we are putting together a very versatile itinerary for them to have an opportunity for him to be with his teammates to meet with folks across the river to discuss his coming back to school next year … and with medical people in boston since we have some of the best medical people on the planet here … from a team standpoint everybody s really really excited to see ben and i know he will be an inspiration for us going into the yale game. inside the process of turning fenway into a football stadium for harvard-yale harvard beats yale 34-24 and traditions continue harvard yale face off in football for 130th time fenway s natural surface is prompting the team to use its grass practice fields for the first time since september harvard doesn t often play on grass as there are only two remaining ivy schools that don t have artificial turf and one is yale and miller says he and his teammates are expecting a tough physical game the game day set-up on the sideline will add an extra level of intensity as fenway s configuration calls for the teams to be next to each other on the same side of the field and the crowd always raucous and totaling about 40,000 fans will certainly play a role for both teams for those who ll be part of the largest crowd at a harvard home game the match-up sold out in two days there will be pregame opportunities to gather with friends fellow students alumni and colleagues in an area for undergraduates in the stadium s ipswich street parking lot and in a fan zone located in the brookline avenue lot for everyone else i do empathize with folks who certainly take great pleasure and pride in the tradition of harvard vs. yale and harvard stadium as a home game said murphy who is coaching in his 25th edition of the game but i think at the end of the day anybody who ventures out for this game will have a really exciting educational and ultimately satisfying experience. women make up 51.7 percent of those accepted tagging along on a student-led historical tour finding the hearths
