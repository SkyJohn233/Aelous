Below is a snippet that describes what I'm trying to do.  In my application I have a replaysubject that's used throughout.  At a certain point I want to get the last value emitted from the subject, but  last  doesn't seem to work on a ReplaySubject. FIDDLE The code above doesn't fire anything for the  lastObserver , but subscribe works just fine. Maybe your confusion is about how the  .last()  operator is supposed to work? .last()  should wait for a stream to complete, then give you the last value emitted before the stream ended. So in order for it to work, the stream will need to end. I believe your  lastObserver  will emit as soon as the subject completes. If you don't want your stream to end, but you do want subscribers to receive the last value emitted before subscription, consider reaching for  BehaviorSubject , which was designed for this use case.
