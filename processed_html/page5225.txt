GoNoodle inspires, measures and rewards kids when they move with short bursts of physical activity through online videos and games. It is available to Jefferson County teachers and parents thanks to support from Kosair Children’s Hospital and Passport Health Plan. “Teachers see immediate results after using GoNoodle,” said Tamara Darden, principal at Byck Elementary School in Louisville. “Students get some exercise and then are more settled. Teachers can even incorporate it into lesson plans.” Officials from GoNoodle, Passport, the Children’s Hospital and JCPS joined Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer on Thursday, October 13, for a demonstration of the GoNoodle program at Byck Elementary. Mayor Fischer even joined second-graders in Miss Heuglin’s class when they did their daily activities! “GoNoodle helps make our children healthier and stronger,” Mayor Fischer said. “And when our children are stronger, our whole city is stronger.” GoNoodle   is currently available free of charge to more than 3,600 teachers in 178 Louisville schools, reaching nearly 68,000 K-5 students in Jefferson County. For more information, please  click here . Beyond Jefferson County, Passport and the Children’s Hospital have also partnered to bring GoNoodle into nearly 50 other counties around Kentucky. And Passport is working with additional hospital systems to bring GoNoodle into the following counties: “Too many Kentucky schoolchildren get less than 60 minutes of physical activity each day. To improve these numbers, Passport Health Plan has been working with many hospitals and school systems around the Commonwealth since 2014 to bring the GoNoodle program into classrooms and help our children improve their health and quality of life,” said Passport Health Plan CEO Mark B. Carter. “We are proud to join the children’s hospital to bring the GoNoodle program to all of Jefferson County’s elementary schools. Together, we can help all Kentuckians live healthier lives.” “With Passport, we see what true partnership and collaboration means in a really authentic way.” “It’s just a wonderful place to work, and to bring  &  utilize your skills while making a difference in someone’s life.” “I’ve had rewarding member conversations where they’ve told me they think I’m as important to them as their kids.” “When people need help there should always be somebody to help them,  &  I’m glad that I can fulfill that role for them.” “With Passport, we see what true partnership and collaboration means in a really authentic way.” This is a form of yoga that nearly anyone will do.
