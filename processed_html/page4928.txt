How do I sync Outlook Notes from my PC to Notes on my iPhone 6Plus?  I thought I could do it in iTunes under Device Info but there was no option. I know there must be a way to copy them to the phone.

I could still use some help if you don't mind.  I found that I did have iCloud on my PC but had not utilized it.  I set up an iCloud e-mail which now shows up in my Outlook on the PC.  I check-marked the Email for Outlook box in the iCloud settings area.  I have the iCloud drive set to ON in my phone settings and also have it set to yes to use iCloud for mail, contacts, calendars, reminders and notes. Within Outlook I see it says "syncing with all subscribed folders" when it checks for new iCloud mail.   I just updated to ios 11.2.6 on my phone and looked in the Summary area for my iPhone under the Info button in iTunes and it says that mail, calendar, etc. are being synced with iCloud. No Outlook notes showing up on my iPhone.  How do I get them there?  Sorry I can't figure this out.  I appreciate the help!!

I see a notes folder in the tree view under the iCloud inbox but it's empty.   Thanks again - I hope you can help me!
