Highway of Legends - Colorado | AllTrails Highway of Legends is a 64.5 mile moderately trafficked point-to-point trail located near Walsenburg, Colorado that offers scenic views and is good for all skill levels. The trail is primarily used for nature trips and scenic driving and is accessible year-round. Drove this way recently and noticed a glaring error in the route. Just updated it to show highway 12 from Trinidad to La Veta instead of interstate 25 from Trindad to Walsenburg (which is not particularly scenic by Colorado standards). It took 30 seconds with the  " suggest edit "  tab and Alltrails updated it within 24 hours. Looking at the reviews, folks have griped for years that the route shown was wrong, but apparently did not take a minute to help fix it. If you see a mistake, let Alltrails know, they are great about following up quickly and the other users will thank you for having the correct information.  Would be great if the map reflected that the actual highway of legends is hwy 12 from Trinidad to Laveta instead of interstate 25. Great day trip. Tons of good places to stop and fish, take pictures, explore, and relax. Stop at the Dog Bar in Cuchara, they have awesome pizza. Beautiful drive Pulling a 10,000# Kubota tractor with loader, brush hog, tiller, and box scraper from Trinidad to Le Veta with a 1/2 ton Toyota Tundra. Breath taking for an Oklahoman!!
