kindness is a superpower fablittlebag fablittlebag the best disposal method period an article by the fabulously wise pinky lilani about kindness in leadership made me stop me abruptly mid to do list and made me pause for thought kindness – it s always a virtue that i drum into my teenage boys always something i try and often fail to remind myself to embed in my everyday life and always something i notice the incredible positive impact of when on the receiving end yet it is not something that is focused on in the business world when locked in the cut and thrust of practicalities and deadlines missed deadlines juggling and pressure kindness is easily forgotten i am guilty of simply reacting to the inevitable disappointments rejections and let downs that go hand in hand with a growing business growling at the unfairness of it all and how disappointing people can be… it takes a lot of effort for these not to get you down and sometimes one s kindness is forgotten yet i truly believe that kindness giving with no expectation of return is a superpower it has the power not only to change someone else s emotional state but also your own it s a feel good drug so i for one will be donning my kindness cloak each morning as a way of a mental reminder remembering that no act is too small so thank you pinky lilani for this reminder most kind so utterly true and the key personal attribute that is missing from so much of public life at the moment it is the touchstone by which i try to live my life and i thank you for this post your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name email website save my name email and website in this browser for the next time i comment
