is jolteon or ampharos the better electric type pokemon yahoo answers please tell me which is better i x27 m wondering which one i should train for my pokemon pearl game and please don x27 t tell me i should choose jolteon if i want this and i should choose ampharos if i want that i already know the pros and cons to each one i x27 m looking for specific opinions also please tell me which moves you would teach the pokemon you think i should train by base stats jolteon hp 65 atk 65 def 60 sp.atk 110 sp.def 95 spd 130 total 525 ampharos hp 90 atk 75 def 75 sp.atk 115 sp.def 90 spd 55 total 500 therefore hp atk def sp.atk jolteon ampharos sp.def speed total jolteon ampharos by tier jolteon ou overused ampharos nu neverused -_- movesets jolteon ampharos conclusion i therefore conclude that you must prefer jolteon than ampharos though ampharos has higher stats that jolt jolt is more powerful in terms of movesets just use the highly recommended movesets for this well hope i helped good luck btw for movesets check out here http //www.smogon.com/dp/pokemon/jolteon lol i havent played pokemon in a year but i believe that jolteon is better why it is because it has way better speed than ampharos and better special attack but the downside of jolteon is that it doesn x27 t have good defense special defense or hp jolteon can defeat a lot of types it can use dig to beat rock types and electric types it can use double kick to beat rock and ice types pin missile to beat psychic types and thunder moves to beat water so its obvious jolteon is the better choice idk wich is btr now because im 15 and i hadnt played pkmn for 9 yrs now but jolteon was way better back then
