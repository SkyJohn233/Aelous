how to remove ads wasted page space and annoying content gizmo 's freeware last updated by site.editor on 28 december 2014 03:00 are you annoyed with ads banners and other distractions on webpages do some of your favorite websites waste screen space on useless content adblock plus can help and it certainly does n't come without backup abp is just what it says on the tin an adblocker for both firefox and chrome it 's currently one of the most popular add-ons around and most people agree that it does a good job out-of-the-box it removes content based on filter lists that can either be subscribed to for automatic blocking or created manually/semi-automatically doing so speeds up page loading reduces cpu and ram usage and most importantly of all makes your browsing experience much more enjoyable and smoother of course blocking ads is just one way to put it to use it can block literally anything you can write a filter for including various kinds of page content and even scripts the latter makes it useful as a less aggressive alternative for noscript with a block-by-blacklist instead of allow-by-whitelist approach however abp is not flawless the default configuration is not the most effective and can — paradoxically — create severe performance issues you might not notice the latter on a powerful computer but why would you choose to run sub-optimally if you have the option not to laptop users in particular will feel the difference a proper understanding of abp 's mechanism can make note that there are many spin-offs of abp around adblock edge simple adblock adblock lite trueblock plus etc i 've tried each one and to be honest none have given me any reason to prefer them over the original abp if anything they only created new problems that i wo n't go into here my recommendation is to stay away from them while abp is the focus of this article there are various other adblockers available i wo n't talk about those because they focus on a small number of large mainstream websites only however i did come across one particular challenger that immediately struck my fancy more about that one later abp actually consists of two parts the add-on itself and its filter lists the former is merely a tool that has the ability to remove chunks of content from webpages the latter are what tell abp which content to remove i.e they 're the hand that wields the tool when loading a page abp reads and processes each filter in the installed filter lists and blocks any matching page content some filters describe only a single element while others are open-ended enough to block dozens of elements at once there are 2 kinds of lists those that you subscribe to and those that you create and maintain manually subscription lists are automatically updated and maintained by a community of volunteers with a lead author these are some of the most popular examples each website or webpage usually requires its own dedicated filters because of this websites that are not frequented by anyone in a list 's community will hardly be cleaned small niche websites are unlikely to be supported by your list while large and well-known websites will be practically ad-free after a few years of using abp i started searching for the source of the constant freezes and memory leaks i was having in my otherwise smoothly running firefox easylist and the other popular filter lists sadly turned out to be the culprits this is what i found the reason popular filter lists make firefox slow is because of their size all filters need to be loaded and possibly applied on each page which is a gargantuan task i 've found traces of a tree structure in which the individual letters of a filter 's domain if any form its branches if that 's what 's used then abp can fairly easily skip groups of filters that have no relevance to the current page but the overall task of navigating the tree and the sheer number of filters to parse is still huge i no longer use easylist or any other subscription lists but then how do i block the stuff i do n't want keep reading to learn more about how to solve that problem after installing abp you 'll have 2 new context menu entries adblock image and adblock frame the former obviously serves to block specific images while the latter blocks specific frames wait what are frames a frame is essentially a webpage embedded in another visually similar to the screenshots embedded in this text one example can be found right here at gizmo 's the search box if you enter something into the search box you 'll get a new page with search results from the site does n't the list of results look familiar though indeed it 's a google page more specifically it 's a google frame go ahead and try it but do n't forget to click back to return here when you hover the cursor over either an image or frame and click the appropriate option you 'll get a window where you can choose from a set of filters that block what you clicked each one has its own level of specificness the top-most filter blocks only the exact thing you clicked while the bottom one blocks everything coming from the entire website in-between are options that are slightly more and slightly less specific one resource directory level and domain level at a time if you 've read the second part of the basic mechanics section in my noscript article you 'll know exactly what to choose in this window otherwise here 's a quick tutorial things like frames and images are loaded from webservers where they 're stored as files in a folder structure you 'll be blocking specific files folders or entire webservers with these filters in the image to the right encrypted-tbn0 gstatic.com is the server gstatic.com is its parent domain google 's in this case and images is the entire relevant folder structure if you choose the top-most option you 'll probably be blocking every image coming from that particular google server choosing to block gstatic.com will block 99 of everything on every server owned by google to make a long story short try to block exactly that which seems like the source of the unwanted content nothing more or less if you see a folder name that suggests it contains everything you do n't want block that folder if that 's not enough block the server if even that does n't suffice block the entire network/domain that is also the following order in which the filters are displayed you can also manually modify one of these if they just do n't cut it if you wish to learn how and i recommend that you do you can read the excellent tutorial on the official website it will also show you how to block scripts and other exotic page content advanced users may want to be aware of once you 've made your choice the filter will be added to one of abp 's manual lists you can edit or remove it or add more by opening the appropriate tab in abp 's filter preferences window although abp provides a way to manually select content that needs to be removed it only works on images and frames that 's hardly sufficient for powerusers for that purpose element hiding helper was created ehh is a plugin for abp that allows you to select anything on a webpage and automatically creates a filter for it just click select element to hide in abp 's menu hover over what you want to remove make sure the red selection box is where it should be there are hotkeys to adjust it and click when everything looks ok in the window that pops up you can customize the filter you 're about to create though in a much easier way than before first select the domain on which the filter should work then simply select the criteria the filter should target the class name and id attributes are most useful for this though you can also select the other ones if left with no choice do n't worry about messing things up by making the wrong choices this time there 's a live preview of the filter 's effects of course if you 're going to block everything manually you 'll have some work ahead of you while trying to find a solution that encompasses everything i 've written so far i decided to use simple but abstract computer logic to dictate an answer i 've had some previous run-ins with this method such as the secure/open/convenient trade-off which is another variation of the same basic logic put simply trying to simulate human judgment can be done in 2 ways accurately which requires a lot of power or quickly/easily which wo n't be accurate easylist and its alternatives try to accurately block everything making them an example of the former i think it 's wiser to use the latter approach use a simpe program to get 90 of the work done quickly then ask the user to complete the final negligible 10 of the workload so how can this solution be put to use with bluhell firewall despite its name bf is simply a lightweight adblocker it has no configuration menus or other interfaces and contains a single very short list of filters based on a contraction of the entire easylist bf will take care of the majority of ads on all websites but of course it will miss a few on sites you visit often you can use abp+ehh or manual filter writing to take care of the last few eye-sores it 's no more effort than bookmarking a new website and subscribing to its rss feed once it 's done it remains done and you do n't need to do it again on new websites you have n't been to you 'll at least see fewer ads without reduced performance another way to block ads most of the time is through requestpolicy details about it can be found in the section about it in my noscript article put simply requestpolicy blocks all 3rd party content on webpages except that which you allow through a whitelist or click-to-play including scripts images and flash objects that means any 3rd party advertisements be it images or flash animations will never load without the need for specific blacklisting and with a perfectly future-safe approach the only weakness of it is that content from the site itself is not checked and a certain portion of ads is indeed hosted locally hide comments i know that using easylist without element hiding reduces the memory used in adp is it possible to reduce the number of rules in the easylist to about 200 rules and use a host file to block the rest of the ads nice thought-provoking article but the author should have specified that his holy trinity strategy only works for firefox users because the extensions needed for it are firefox-only not counting abp thanks for the answer the approach i was advocating above is to use bluehell in lieu of the big lists keep abp and add short lists selectively to abp like the fanboy lists mentioned i use wot i also use ehh have for a long also pop up blocker for abp when i ran bluehell last year i did use ehh to do what you suggested i simply do n't have the time anymore to develop a manual list i 'm going to try my approach and see what happens let you know faziri great article i like the idea of getting rid of abp i have been using fanboy 's ultimate list for a long time including the tracking enhanced tracking and annoyance lists which i like i do have a question though if you installed bluehell kept abp removed the main list and just dded the 3 discreet fanboy lists above btw i also use the malware domains would this speed up firefox maybe not to the extent that it would by removing adp completely but would this help performance to some degree while giving me more comfort i tried bluehell when it was hellboy without abp about a year ago but i did n't think it blocked things completely or cleanly gizmo 's freeware is recruiting we are looking for people with skills or interest in the following areas mobile platform app reviews for android
