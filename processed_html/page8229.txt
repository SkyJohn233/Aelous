This equivalence applies to pulse sequenceswith arbitrary offset frequency deltaomega(0) which may exceed the RF fieldstrength omega(1). Using this approach, we examine steady-state free precession(SSFP) in grossly inhomogeneous fields. We show explicitly that the magnitude of the magnetization for each mode at an offset frequency deltaomega(0) is equal to that for SSFP with on-resonance pulses of rescaled amplitude, with the samedependence on relaxation times and diffusion coefficient. The rescaling dependson offset frequency and RF field strength. The theoretical results have beentested experimentally and excellent agreement is found. ><
