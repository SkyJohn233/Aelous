Imprint DEKRA tests the quality of candles and their raw materials on behalf of the Quality Association for Candles, as well as for manufacturers and retail. With the "RAL Quality Mark for Candles", consumers are given the assurance that they are purchasing high quality candles. Burning too fast or unevenly, dripping wax and the formation of soot can all be avoided by purchasing tested candles, as can harmful concentrations of substances that damage the environment and your health (e.g. PAH, sulfur dioxide).  Manufacturers who want to label their candles with this quality mark may only use candle raw materials, dyes and paints that meet clearly defined purity and quality standards.  Our testing and analysis services cover:  We are pleased about your interest in our laboratory services.
