Bespoke Global - Darcy Miro Darcy Miro draws inspiration for her custom jewelry, sculpture, and architectural works from nature and the human body. Her creations resemble organic shields   beautiful and abstract metal wraps that are products of an intense visionary who appreciates the resiliency and strength of metal. Her pieces are meticulously crafted from sterling silver, white bronze, copper, or 18-or 24-karat gold. The occasional diamond softens the raw nature of the pieces. The materials Darcy uses reflect the embodiment of her work: strong, bold and organic. Her sculptural background is evident as the artist s jewelry takes on the role of wearable art. A graduate of Rhode Island School of Design with a degree in Jewelry and Metalsmithing, Darcy has become a mainstay in the art world, particularly in New York, where she completed in 1999 a collaborative installation piece for the facade of the Museum of American Folk Art. Darcy is based in Brooklyn, N.Y. About a Bespoke Commission beckandcall@bespokeglobal.com (+1) 212.537.0112
