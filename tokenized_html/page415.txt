urinary tract infections aka utis in fact 40 to 60 percent of women will experience at least one uti in their lifetime and 1 in 4 will have multiple according to the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases niddk that s because a woman has a shorter urethra aka the tube that releases urine than a man making it easier for bacteria to reach the urinary tract still it s also not a female-only issue around 12 percent of american men especially those over 50 will get a uti in their lifetime the infection can form in any part of your urinary tract including your bladder urethra ureters or kidneys but there are other reasons women are more predisposed to urinary tract infections for instance if you re postmenopausal your likelihood of having a uti increases in women

the vagina can alter the balance of bacteria and yeast in postmenopausal women and make it easier for bacteria to make their way into the urethra utis are also fairly common for sexually active women adds dr. mishra although peeing before and after sex can help prevent their occurrence since you re flushing out bacteria women with diabetes are also more likely to get a uti because of condition s impact on the immune system and unfortunately there are even more common causes of a uti including constipation dehydration a switch in birth control and even the type of underwear you 're wearing to

dr. mishra however it doesn t necessarily mean you have a full-blown uti unless it becomes persistent if you only feel pain once during the day and don t show any other symptoms of a uti your body has likely already flushed out the bacteria drinking extra water as soon as the burning starts may help flush out small amounts of bacteria and help prevent the infection from growing according to lisa dabney md a urogynecologist at mount sinai west and mount sinai st. luke s. if all you can think about is how badly you have to pee especially if you just went and are experiencing other symptoms such as painful urination you probably have a uti bacteria can irritate the urethra and the lining of the bladder and make you feel like you desperately need to go constantly says dr. mishra still many women will experience an over-active bladder without an infection so be sure to note if the urge is not typical for you when speaking with a doctor frequent urination is another symptom of a urinary tract infection a uti can make you feel like you have a full bladder but only dribbles come out when you go frequent trips to the bathroom and little to no relief are telltale signs to look out for

infection says dr. mishra before you panic take stock of what you ate in the past 24 hours beets and other foods can also make your pee a frightening pink orange or red color but you won t have any pain and the color will quickly pass if something you ate is to blame you don t have to sniff the bowl every time you go but a strong pungent smell is a common uti symptom however some foods may also

older women in particular may have cramping pressure or abdominal pain when they have a uti in some women pain cramping and muscle aches may be the most pronounced symptoms these symptoms are often easy to ignore or attribute to something else say something you ate or pms but it s important to pay attention to them and bring them up with your doctor who can help you find the cause as with any type of infection once the body detects that something is wrong it goes into a state of inflammation along with other protective measures this triggers the release of white blood cells that that can cause feelings of fatigue while your late-night netflix binge may be to blame for your constant yawning if the grogginess doesn t dissipate after a few days speak to your doctor especially if you ve noticed other uti symptoms paired with other uti symptoms a fever is often a sign that the infection has become more serious and spread to the kidneys says dr. mirsha if you have a fever over 101 f or and are experiencing chills or night sweats seek medical help immediately even though you may have heard that cranberry juice is the magical cure for utis don t fall into the hype while cranberry juice contains an active ingredient to prevent bacteria from attaching itself to the walls of your bladder the juice doesn t contain enough of that ingredient to really make a difference plus it s packed with added sugar says dr. mishra a uti can be incredibly painful and interrupt your daily life but these infections are easy to treat once you seek the help of a doctor who will test your urine

this is especially important once you have started taking antibiotics extra fluids will help get the antibiotics to the infected area faster and also help remove bacteria drinking six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily can also help prevent future infections according to the niddk consider otc options dr. mishra recommends popping a urinary pain relief medication such as azo these medications numb the bladder relieve burning and reduce the constant urge to go be warned they will turn your urine a shocking shade of orange you can always use over-the-counter pain medications like tylenol or motrin but they don t seem to work as well as azo or pyridium says dr. mishra skip the coffee soda alcohol and citrus juice stick to water to avoid irritating your bladder use a heating pad if you re experiencing cramps or painful pressure a heating pad can help ease your discomfort and once your symptoms have totally cleared up avoid holding in pee for long periods of time bacteria flourishes when urine stays in the bladder for too long always wipe from front to back after having a bowel movement to prevent bacteria transfer and consider using birth control without spermicides as they have been linked to a higher chance of utis all of these small everyday habits will go a long way toward preventing urinary tract infections
