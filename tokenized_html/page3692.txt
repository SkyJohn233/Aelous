candidate name parisima taeb political position sought state representative district 78 occupation board certified internal medicine physician education medical school residence fort myers why are you running for this office i am running for this office because there are multiple public health issues that our community is facing and i want to make our community safer and stronger what makes you stand out from your opponent s i am not a politician or a corporate attorney as a physician i will use evidence-based facts to implement bills to make a stronger and safer community previous elective office/ elective office experience i have never held an elected office do you have a criminal record have you ever been found to have committed any other civil or ethical violations no would the state of your health impede you from serving in this position no what are your three most important priorities if you are elected or re-elected priority 1 toxic algae crisis priority 2 opioid crisis priority 3 quality and affordable health care how would you implement priority 1 once elected i will make sure that the polluters are held accountable for the mess they have created i will tax the polluters fairly and appropriately i will implement bills that will put strict regulations on the number of chemicals being dumped into our waterways the two parties need to work together to make sure we buy the land necessary for the reservoir i will also reinstate the harmful algae bloom taskforce which will allow scientists and to monitor and test our waters to help prevent these toxic algae crisis from happening how would you implement priority 2 our district s opioid crisis has worsened by 800 in the last 4 years we must have more medically assistant treatment centers for patients addicted to opioids we must train more physicians in addiction medicine so they can be available to treat these patients and we also must have needle exchange programs which will allow patients to exchange their dirty needles for clean needles and at these centers there are counselors to help the addicted patients and there is also narcan available we also must make sure all first responders have narcan available in case a patient is overdosing on opioids unfortunately opioid addiction in our district is correlated with a high percentage of babies born with nas it is also causing our foster homes programs to be in full capacity due to children who are neglected or abused and human trafficking and sex trafficking is also linked to the opioid crisis how would you implement priority 3 healthcare is a human right not a privilege every person must have affordable and quality healthcare as a physician i see patients every day who lack health care coverage due to its high costs people are not getting the preventive work up studies needed for cancer screening those who lack health care coverage are at a higher risk of ending up in the emergency department due to their progressively worsened medical condition and this uses tax payer s money for their er visit also patients with pre-existing conditions must be able to have health care coverage and once elected i will make sure to protect this coverage do you support open records and open meetings laws would you ever support any exemptions to the public 's right to access information would you support efforts to expand these laws yes i do support open records and open meeting laws we also need to make sure that public s right to access information is not jeopardizing someone s safety do you support drug testing of elected officials why or why not yes i do support drug testing of elected officials if an elected official is under the influence of drugs it interferes with their decision making and thought process elected officials have an obligation to protect the community by implementing bills and policies for the best interest of their people when the elected official is under influence of drugs they are unable to fulfill this duty read more candidate questionnaires at news-press.com/election 2019 www.news-press.com all rights reserved
