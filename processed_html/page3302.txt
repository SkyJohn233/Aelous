The Cost to Paint a Bedroom | Home Guides | SF Gate Carefully measure and purchase all supplies before you start to paint the bedroom. Jupiterimages/Pixland/Getty Images The cost to paint a bedroom depends on the square footage and layout of the room. It will largely be determined by how much paint you need, its cost per gallon and the other paint supplies required. Rooms with features that take away wall space, such as large windows and doorways, require less paint than rooms with, for example, small windows and high ceilings. Take a tape measure and measure the length and height of each bedroom wall. Multiply the two numbers together to get the square footage of the wall. Repeat for each wall, and then add the numbers together to get the total square footage of wall space. A gallon of paint will typically cover 300 to 400 square feet and prices range from $20 to $50 per gallon at the time of publication. A typical 10-by-10 room has 320 square feet of wall space, so you'd need 1 or 2 gallons of paint -- costing $40 to $100. You likely need painter's tape, brushes, rollers, rags, paint trays and a plastic drop cloth to protect the floor. The cost of these items varies depending on where you purchase and how much you purchase, but it should be less than $50 for all miscellaneous paint supplies.
