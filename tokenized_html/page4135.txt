is buying gold an option at all financialindependence i have a friend that i talk to about fi alot and he x27 s the only person that i even look at managing my money and investing and things like that we were talking the other day about our specific plans to invest and while mine was vanguard index funds his was real estate and gold i can see how the real estate would be a good investment but i cant really see why he would want to buy gold could anyone enlighten me no i mean you could do worse but gold is a stupid investment for the period 1928-2013 the average annual compound real return of stocks 6.3 and gold 2.0 however the price of gold was controlled by the government until the mid-70s when the us finally abandoned the gold standard for the period 1976-2013 the average returns were stocks 7.2 and gold 2.0 source so gold is a great investment if you want to piss away 2/3rds of your potential returns and i don x27 t buy the omg apocolypse argument either in the event of that kind of devastation there are things that would be worth more than gold and infinitely more useful bullets gasoline nuka-cola bottle caps what x27 s doubly ludicrous is that many goldbugs who worry about existential threats to the national government actually own paper gold anyway if their fears were actually realized i doubt they x27 d be able to dodge the roving mutant gangs long enough to cash in their gold certificates i know at least one person who buries gold in their backyard but again the whole idea seems silly and i x27 m being deliberately sarcastic about it you want to own something that generates real income that x27 s wealth not metal in the ground don x27 t own gold instead go buy a mine or better yet a low-cost diversified index fund that owns such things that fallout reference pretty much ditto if you must own gold own a gold etf either a gold mining company fund or a fund that actually purchases bullion don x27 t bother with coins in an safe deposit box but mostly there are just better investments sure diversify a little and have little precious metals in your portfolio but probably not more than 5 real estate depends a lot on where you live in some places you can buy a property with 20 down and immediately rent it out at a price that completely pays your piti and then some that x27 s completely aside from appreciation of the property itself that x27 s basically a free house and i x27 ll take that over buying gold any day of course not every region has that dynamic period 1928-2013 the average annual compound real return of stocks 6.3 i x27 m being nit picky cagr of s p500 with dividend reinvestment and adjustment for inflation 6.61 source precious metals are not investments unless you want to not even beat inflation most years they are stores of wealth wouldn x27 t it be true that any store of wealth that doesn x27 t beat inflation isn x27 t really a store of wealth i x27 m not trying to be pedantic i just don x27 t see how if your principal is eroding you x27 re really storing wealth edit i get it i x27 m wrong my thought was more about how we choose to store value not all stores of value are created equal check out the permanent portfolio returns and volatility compare that with a 50/50 stocks and bonds portfolio compare their numbers and graphs you will be surprised given the comments on this post gold is a hedge against inflation in the ultra long term only in the last few decades gold has not been a hedge against inflation gold is a hedge against the trustworthiness of fiat currencies as a tool used to diversify an already well rounded portfolio gold and other precious metals are an excellent route that said i can x27 t imagine it would be prudent to allocate any more than 10 of your bankroll into it what does he say when you ask him it sounds to me and i x27 m just speculating here based on the motivations of other gold bugs i x27 ve run across is that he x27 s not so much a gold bull as he is a dollar bear but if you x27 re really a dollar bear there are much better ways to short the dollar the vanguard internationals for instance to answer your question gold can provide another avenue of diversification say you x27 re invested in an already diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds but you want to increase your level of diversification rather than add another stock or bond adding gold will provide more diversification because it can be thought of as a hedge against stock/bond market risk the downside is it isn x27 t a productive asset you could try a permanent portfolio which has a large 25 gold component and has performed relatively well historically decent returns and low volatility but i wouldn x27 t recommend buying a bunch of gold thinking that the economic system will fail and gold will save you fail-safe investing fail-safe investing lifelong financial security in 30 minutes is a personal finance book written by american investment analyst and politician harry browne relevant harry ^browne permanent portfolio family of ^funds octopus ^card parent commenter can toggle ^nsfw or ^delete will also delete on comment score of -1 or less faqs ^mods call ^me yes but gold should probably be more viewed as inflation proctected currency it x27 s like saving in cash but more inflation procted because the supply of gold is pretty constant it appricates in line with an increase in the money supply i probably wouln x27 t do just gold but could def be a part of an portfolio where instead of holding cash or t-bills you hold gold is that a legitimate fear who would buy the gold if currency collapses i imagine things like food and hunting equipment would be more valuable in that situation and i don x27 t think gold would help much a good food storage would be far more valuable and is useful in a host of other situations as well if you x27 re worried about the us economy collapsing buy foreign stock which should be in your portfolio anyway even then the us economy collapsing will probably cause other markets to collapse as well like we x27 ve seen with greece x27 s situation which is much smaller than the us and would likely result in widespread war i really don x27 t buy the currency collapse argument the likelihood of that happening is so remote that it x27 s not worth special attention have a general disaster plan and enjoy life i think gold can be a useful hedge but it comes with a couple large drawbacks there are high costs to holding it in a real form to get physical gold you x27 ll pay more than it x27 s worth and even with gold-holding etfs you get a poor tax treatment gold doesn x27 t have great historic real returns so you are unlikely to make a lot of money off it on the other hand gold has one significant advantage it x27 s decoupled with the price of stocks bonds and real estate so it x27 s unlikely to crash at the same time as everything else and may even increase during that time i plan to hold 1-3 precious metals in my portfolio gold has dive bombed in the last few years the stock market has dive bombed in some years is that reason enough for you to never invest in it i am not buying gold but your logic is flawed https //www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/success/feel-wealthy/ utm_source=ada_optimizely utm_campaign=horizontalstripbiztest hpt=ob_blogfooterold this article did better at capturing our collective sentiments than most have they went through the math of how much you could spend with a 3 swr on 2.26m and interviewed several people with different nw x27 s and different ways of getting there to me the fact that cnn is doing an article like this makes me think we might be a lot more mainstream than before i would like to see more from them on this maybe even a recurring segment with different financial tips would be cool if they did a long term ride along with someone on their path to fire our personal goal to re is a bit higher than 2m closer to 4m but curious what others have to say i x27 ve had the opportunity to see a relative acquire a good chunk of land in a beautiful location build a fairly sized wood cabin and cultivate the land collect water and use solar for energy and i x27 ve never seen this relative so fulfilled in fact he told me i x27 ve never been this content with life i x27 ve also had the great chance of experiencing some homestead life for a few uninterrupted weeks and it changed my outlook on life in a pretty drastic way akin to taking psychedelics for the first time i.e experiencing a set of experiences you didn x27 t know were even available they were hidden and now you know and while the afterglow will dissipate you will never be the same again this is one of the reasons i x27 m interested in fi anyone else in a similar spot here is version 4.1 please read the flow chart entirely before commenting since some redditors have been commenting or pming of missing items sometimes it s just buried deep please provide constructive criticism where i will evaluate for the next version if it s needed if you provide details on what exactly you d like changed and provide justification that can be sufficient to persuade me i hope i fixed the viewing for mobile users if not i am sorry i think it depends on what app or interface you are using i x27 ll be traveling tomorrow so i don x27 t know if i have much time to make another iteration but i am quite happy with this version i haven x27 t received any word from moderators if they wanted to put this in the sidebar or anything so i x27 ll just assume that it x27 ll be stored in a post format for people to reference then i hope you enjoy version history for those interested version 1.3 version 2.0 version 3.0 version 3.1 version 4.0 given how close we are to the start of a new decade i figured it might be fun for some of us to reminisce and speculate i bet a lot of us have come a long way so please leave a comment answering three questions where were you in the context of fire ten years ago at the start of 2010 where are you now at the start of 2020 where do you plan to be in ten years at the start of 2030 i x27 ll go first in the comments i ask this because i usually see employed people on this subreddit who want out of the work force it x27 s very rare to see a small business owner who wants out despite dealing with much longer hours and stress would a lot of people looking to fire be happier self employed rather than doing nothing 2009 30 years old 30k total savings 2019 40 years old 300k invested ten years ago i was doing just fine the deepest trough of the recession had passed but it was still a pretty unsettling time i was content to be in grad school insulated from the outside world with a steady stipend of 28k from a grant plus an additional few k a year from doing translation work and academic consulting i was saving the 4k year max to my roth most years and that was it i was lucky to be in the ivory tower mainly because i really enjoyed my thinking work and enjoyed especially the scientific programming aspects of my biology research i was good at being a graduate student but i was also lucky because it seemed scary out there and comfortable in here also i had student loan debt that i could keep deferring while i was technically still a student it took me a long time to leave the academic world i bounced around with postdocs for a while before finally making an intentional decision with my partner to move to put down roots that was the single biggest factor in my current happiness and in helping me move out of academic work 10 years later we have an old lovely expensive house in a neighborhood we would be happy to stay in forever i have been working as a data scientist for the last three years the goal of fi has been central in my decision making helping me focus on maximizing my income now within reason to get free of the working world when i want knock on wood i x27 ll hit my goal before 55 probably 50 i just crossed the 300k mark for my investments excluding e-fund house other assets i have no debt other than the mortgage lessons learned in the last decade leaving academia was the best financial and overall well-being decision i made patiently sticking to a fi plan has been rewarding and i thank this community for the inspiration edit i appreciate the interest in how i made the transition to data science i x27 ll make a post over in r/datascience sometime soon to explain more as for others considering making the change from academia yes life is good out here i don x27 t see myself spending more than 40k a year obviously this can change depending on where life takes me and emergencies and such down the line with this i would still have a generous savings account strictly for emergencies so until something huge were to happen i should still be covered what i am wondering is if there is anything wrong with using a taxable investment account for the majority of my assets and withdrawing 38,600 a year from that account i am under the assumption that this would mean i would pay no gains tax as the gains would be considered long-term if this was this case would this be more beneficial for retiring early as i wouldn x27 t have to take any penalties when withdrawing from a roth or having to mess with a conversion ladder is this too simple i feel like there has to be an issue with this method tl dr have one taxable account with most of my assets withdraw 38,600 a year gains tax-free never have to deal with withdraw penalties or roth conversion ladders would this work link https //www.nytimes.com/2019/12/14/business/retirement-social-security-recession.html essentially many of those issues are addressed head on in this community proper research long term planning and managing expenses ensures we don x27 t end up in that predicament these factors opens up the doors to fi/re for essentially all income levels so i believe i m almost there single 40 3.6m that s been growing steadily but i m missing something critical here like what do i actually do once i get to the supposed end where fire is near i.e which things do i invest in how do i actually start drawing down the specific mechanics of it i haven t seen anything specifically detailing this stuff out sorry if this is clearly posted somewhere i missed i recently started listening to david sinclair s lifespan why we age and why we don t have to in the book he discusses what has been learned about the mechanisms of aging and how we on the brink of emerging technologies and pharmaceuticals that can combat these mechanisms to allow us to live for much longer he emphasizes that this increased lifespan will also include a dramatically increased healthspan and envisions that within our lifetime we could see the average lifespan in developed countries increase by over 20 years 80-90 year-olds could be traveling and hiking trails in full health with another 20-30 years to look forward to in the later chapters he discusses how this future although idealistic on the surface does harbor some complications when it comes to overpopulation limited resources and government it would lead to a very quick draw-down of social security funds as the program was not designed for a population that would live much past mid-sixties the traditional age of retirement would be pushed back drastically for people to live comfortably into their new golden years people who worked in physically demanding jobs for 30-40+ years would need to continue their back-breaking work into their 70s+ although in better health or else learn new marketable skills if caught in the middle of their career during this technological breakthrough they may reconsider their college degree or lack thereof altogether as with most emerging technologies the initial onset of age-combating drugs will likely be prohibitively expensive for as much as a late-stage capitalism dystopia it may sound like the wealthy will inevitably be the first to benefit from these technologies conjuring thoughts of mr. burns-like immortals then even when it becomes mainstream the wealthy will enjoy all the benefits of their extra years without the worry of money being financially independent in a time like this could effectively double the value you get from the 25x+ yearly expenses nest egg where value is measured as healthy years not working also having the money available to benefit from these technologies early on could literally buy you time in this future there is a much higher incentive to make financial independence a goal it wouldn t be surprising if the temperance typically preached in these types of communities becomes a much more embraced virtue in a future of increasing population edit- a couple posts seem to think this is impossible for the sole reason that they haven t seen it before these drugs are already proven to extend the life of mice worms apes etc but are not fully tested on humans and take a while to do so as we tend to live pretty long as it is healthy skepticism is great but i d encourage those outright disregarding the possibility of life extending technologies to respect what science has given us thus far and respect that it will continue to provide incredible advancements for us in the future i ve built a new zealand fi flow chart based on the original hard work by u/happyasianpanda here on r/financialindependence on the us fi flowchart nz s a lot simpler and hopefully i ve laid out the steps in roughly the right order this is version 0.5 and based on feedback i ll look to put out an updated version sometime before christmas either add a comment below or pm me around improvements corrections missing items etc this is intended as a general information and not financial advise please only give feedback in relation to nz ver 0.5
