Kansas Jayhawks football vs. Texas Tech: Time, TV, preview | The Kansas City Star  By Jesse Newell Two offenses will be the story lines  &# x2014; for different reasons  &# x2014; as Kansas football travels to face Texas Tech on Saturday. The Red Raiders offense is simply ... good. It ranks top seven nationally in both pass yards and yards per game, specializing in an up-tempo attack employed by coach Kliff Kingsbury. KU, meanwhile, will have the focus placed on its offense because of recent changes. Coach David Beaty  &# x2014; for  the second time  in his tenure  &# x2014; will be the Jayhawks &# x2019; play-caller after  firing offensive coordinator Doug Meacham last week . KU is last in the Big 12 in yards per play and also has struggled in underlying statistics, ranking 125th out of 130 FBS teams in down-to-down efficiency,  according to advanced stats compiled by SB Nation &# x2019;s Bill Connelly .

If the Jayhawks don &# x2019;t fix their biggest weakness  &# x2014; offense  &# x2014; over the next six weeks, they likely won &# x2019;t win another game. And if the future plays out like that, athletic director Jeff Long is likely to be looking for a new football coach in 2019.
