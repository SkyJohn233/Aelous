I deleted my earlier comment by accident. just adding it again here. In Build Settings, Under Swift Compiler - Search Paths, add the CommonCrypto directory i.e ${SRCROOT}/CommonCrypto(as suggest by  @0111b ) Wondering if there's a better way to do that automatically using CocoaPods. Should this be in the OAuthSwift Pod build settings or my own build settings? Neither work for me... Same problem here, tried to add in build settings either to app target or OAuthSwift Pod target but the error persists +1 Having this problem too.
