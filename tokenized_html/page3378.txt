persons england regulations 2000 states the following in section 6 it is required that the authority include in the orders exemptions for disabled persons badges however 6 2 states that such exemptions may be limited to vehicles of the same class as those to which the provision applies in the case of hackney residents bays this is the case where exemptions are limited to holders of resident parking devices namely permits in section 7 due to the if a statutory exemption only applies to maximum stay and no return bays for which hackney has exempted disabled persons badges where parking is not time limited residents bays this exemption is not a statutory requirement and hackney have chosen to utilise the if and not to implement such an exemption this is supported by the dft blue badge scheme right and responsibilities where it is the badge holders responsibility to determine if a particular authority has acted on the if to section 7 and exempted disabled persons badge holders from designated parking places with no maximum stay and no no return element section 8 refers to the use of disabled persons badges in waiting and loading restricted scenarios and would not apply in the circumstances of a residents parking bay or a pay and display bay in section 9 it confirms the requirements in section 7 where parking for a maximum stay or with a no return element do not apply to disabled persons badge holders we hope the above clarifies the matter appeals complaints procedure if you are dissatisfied with this response and wish to appeal please write to the

dear email address the recent reply mention as follows section 6 it is required that the authority include in the orders exemptions for disabled persons badges however 6 2 states that such exemptions may be limited to vehicles of the same class as those to which the provision applies in the case of hackney residents bays this is the case where exemptions are limited to holders of resident parking devices namely permits is anybody alleging that the residence or business permit holders have a differing class of vehicle to those having a blue badge surely this must have been an oversight as it is clearly not so it is further mentioned as follows section 8 refers to the use of disabled persons badges in waiting and loading restricted scenarios and would not apply in the circumstances of a residents parking bay or a pay and display bay. under what regulation and order was any residence or business parking bay restriction created if not an order made under section 1 6 9 35 45 or 46 of the 1984 act and therefore would very much apply in the circumstances of a residents/business parking bay or a pay and display bay this was my original question and therein lies the answer please can i be fully explained thus avoiding my requests for further clarification shahid faiz dear shahid faiz apologies for the lack of response to your feedback which was missed in our case management system your request is marked as an internal review and we will put these further questions to the parking department is anybody alleging that the residence or business permit holders have a differing class

act these are the only information requests that we can discern from your feedback however it may be that the parking department will prefer to engage with your response as a whole outside of the
