The Truth About Sea Salt | UPMC MyHealth Matters We’re all well aware of the recommendation to trim our daily salt intake and aim for less than 2500 mg per day (1500 mg for those with high blood pressure or related risk factors). As I’ve discussed before, cutting back on processed foods is the first and easiest way to do so. Most boxes, cans, and packages are loaded with sodium, contributing about three-quarters of our daily intake. And while the salt shaker contributes only about 10% of our daily salt intake, it’s important to make some smart choices here. Herbs and spices contribute loads of flavor, but it’s not the same as the flavor enhancement of salt – and most people have a hard time down-regulating their “salt tooth.” Used smartly, a little bit of salt added to a salt-free dish can go a long way toward boosting flavor while still keeping your sodium intake in check. That’s where sea salt comes in. While sea salt is not healthier or lower in sodium than regular table salt, it is processed differently, resulting in a difference in taste and texture. Sea salt is produced by simply evaporating sea water. This produces a larger crystal – allowing you to use less of it for flavoring your food. A little sprinkle goes a long way! And you might be surprised to know that the seas around the world produce differently flavored sea salt. Black salt, pink and red salts, and gray salt are just some examples you might want to try.
