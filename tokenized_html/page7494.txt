recommend nas to connect nvidia chromebook and tp-link archer router shieldandroidtv i currently have a 1-tb usb external hard drive with all my media plugged into my router it is filling up and has connectivity problems at times i have not been successful at mapping the drive to my chromebook using the files app i need to replace it with something a bit larger and more feasible i use spmc to play my media but i would like to organize it remotely by using the chromebook i think i x27 m looking for a nas solution but my knowledge of computer hardware is hopelessly out of date can you recommend something that will be easy to use and reliable for this home simple network qnas or synology although if it x27 s connectivity issues then maybe the router needs to be upgraded this is what i have and it works flawlessly 1 synology 2 bay nas diskstation ds218j diskless 2 wd red 4tb nas hard drive 5400 rpm class sata 6 gb/s 64 mb cache 3.5 wd40efrx hooked up to the router i can read and write to it from anywhere on the local network and anywhere using the synology app or website very easy to set up i use it for pc backup and media files use plex server on the shield with the nas as storage i x27 ll give a vote for a synology from what i gathered when i was looking for a nas qnap is generally cheaper and has more features but synology has a pretty top-rate web gui for configuring their systems what i did was install a plex media server on my synology nas and then combined that with the plexkodiconnect addon for kodi should also work for spmc and you know all spmc development has stopped right to let kodi act as a client to plex so the plex server manages my media library while kodi acts like a plex client that doesn x27 t take 50 clicks to drill down to watch a tv show episode just make sure not to buy any units on this list if you go with synology since they x27 re are all eol for the following models dsm 6.2 will be the last upgradable version dsm 6.2 will

get a anaphylaxis/synology drive around ~400.00 -800.00 probably this is the best choice there are other manufacturers too but these are the best you can do what i did and buy a seagate personal cloud or wd my cloud it works it s a low end budget solution ~120.00-250.00you get low end results i regret it you can build a server and have everything i doubt you are ready for that one there are other options but this is a broad generalization set up the plex server on the shield then create an smb share on your synology/qnap and mount it on the shield point your libraries on plex to the share and you x27 re done +1 for syno it has got nice a auto update featrures installalbe apps web-based management tools and android apps which make sense in combination with your chromebook use the latest models for the longer support i.e *18 *19 or *20 i like my qnap but it x27 s not as slick as synology it used to be qnap could do more edge case things but i think they x27 ve both reached parity now works great mounted on my shield used to work fine with an archer c7 but i recently switched to a tp-link google onhub which is different but i like it i think if you x27 re more techy you x27 ll like qnap but if you x27 re not then probably synology there x27 s other options too but the only one i know well ia diy solution called openmediavault and i can recommend that although by the time you buy a computer for omv you x27 re approaching the price of a low end vendor nas anyways and you got ta be pretty techy to linux yourself up a server i tried freenas and it was too complicated and had too high system requirements for zfs a recommendation go big don x27 t get a 2tb system and figure well it took this long to get 1tb it should take just as long to fill 2tb right wrong crap expands to fill the space available my 9tb qnap with nearly 4.5tb of rips of my star trek dvds and blurays a couple tb of high quality rips of my cd collection and it x27 s starting to get a little crowded in there just from two things edit forgot to mention nobody can make the files app work reliably with network shares don x27 t feel bad i use the web interface on my qnap to manipulate files on the server then download them to the chromebook when i had to like any other web file download i have used a drobo for the last 7-8 years and have used it with the shield for the last 2 years or so i have never had any issues i wasn x27 t aware that spmc development had stopped i told you my knowledge is hopelessly out-of-date so should i switch back to kodi p i have never used plex i understood it was for people who wanted to stream video to their phones/tablets we only watch tv on our tv via shield the developer of spmc moved to the mrmc team it x27 s another fork of kodi that has blocked a lot of the piracy addons and that x27 s the extent of my knowledge of it it x27 s a paid app but not expensive i understood it was for people who wanted to stream video to their phones/tablets we only watch tv on our tv via shield that x27 s mostly what i do too i have no idea what spmc is my plex server is on my shield and i watch stuff on my tv via the shield also between synology and qnap which one has an easier interface for my chromebook i will need to do all the file management thru the chromebook as i no longer have a functioning windows machine in my house qts web ui runs fabulously on my chromebook plus v1 i do everything on it i have access to a working windows machine but i haven x27 t used it in months synology 215 216 218 not sure what pricing is like by you but locally it was actually cheaper to buy a small format server pc and install a free nas operating system i use open media vault i use an hp microserver and ask the info i needed to set it up was at the open media vault website and forum i use my shield every day during the last update it froze and would not go past the splash screen i went on online chat with customer care and in less than 10min they determined they would replace it i just needed my receipt and serial number off the original box which i had and boom it x27 s in the mail i x27 m not sure what the warranty is but i have used this box for a little over two and a half years best day ever is there a way to prevent disney+ content from dominating the play next queue on my shield home screen i started a couple movies and series to try it out and every time i open the app now i get all the episodes i didn x27 t finish the next of a couple series and even a couple episodes i have 100 finished at the front of the queue i wan na make it either kodi or perfect player haven x27 t decided side note- anyone else notice though that opening netflix via the button is superrrrrr freakn fast wondering if it does that if you change it to another app tldr ai upscaling high/medium causing severe video stuttering and audio sync issues when source refresh rate does not match system refresh rate reproducible in multiple apps details setup 2019 shield tv pro yamaha rx-v683 lg c7 oled apps tested netflix prime video disney+ plex hulu hbogo shield firmware 8.1.0 32.7.301.32 shield display mode 3840x2160 59.940 hz yuv 422 12-bit rec 2020 dolby vision and hdr10 ready issue when ai upscaling is turned on either high or medium and the source refresh rate does not match the system refresh rate video playback experiences severe stuttering and audio sync issues appears as though several frames are dropped periodically every 1-3 seconds sometimes immediately other times after 5-10 minutes when switching upscaling to basic or enhanced and leaving frame rate unmatched the issue is not present when matching frame rate plex and using ai upscaling the issue is not present when attempting to use the match frame rate beta feature the screen goes black and is unrecoverable only recovery is to unplug the shield and plug it back in when using the refresh rate app to match frame rate the issue is not present but the implementation of this app is severely clunky with most apps and is not conducive to a seamless experience do i just have a faulty shield or can anyone replicate this issue the ai upscaling is a big reason why i went with the 2019 shield over the 2017 shield apple tv 4k combo i was using prior i wanted to simplify my setup and use one device for everything it was between the apple tv 4k and the 2019 shield tv thoughts edit tagging /u/pidge2k for some insight has anyone found a really good aftermarket replacement remote for your shield what apps do you swear by on your shield tv i would say kodi plex and button remappear are my go to so i have a tcl roku tv that i love the famous 6 series many of you may have heard of so our family has 4 of them none had bad dse at all but the latest 55 from costco is the cleanest by far i recommend them now to everyone but i digress anyway i recently got a samsung atmos sound bar at an incredible deal but as i discovered after the fact tcl roku tv x27 s have a compatibility issue with samsung denon and yamaha sound equipment many won x27 t successfully work with dolby digital+ streaming /truehd 4k bluray lossless audio required for atmos hdmi arc is the only way to get this as well optical obviously not an option so i have to manually select regular dolby digital non-plus to get sound from it this still sounds good but also kills any support for atmos but when one uses an external device directly to a receiver or soundbars hdmi in where it then passes video to the tv whatever format that device supports all works great so when i used my shield 2015 connected to the soundbars one input directly i get atmos from plex with my truehd and dd+ content and from vudu and amazon prime with their dd+ but the 2015 and 2017 shield doesn x27 t have atmos in hardware so even though just passthrough is totally supported both netflix and disney+ don x27 t allow atmos over their android apps without it and those 2 apps we use the most and have the most atmos content in their flat monthly plan vs. other ppv options like vudu so i was now resigned to the fact that i really like my tv and really like my soundbar so i x27 d have to go with a new external device but was hoping to only have to drop like 60 on an external roku ironic that it x27 s own built in roku is broken but i then determined the shield 2019 has the most compatibility by far over any other external streaming device i wish i had found this first hehe since i don x27 t play games on my shield anymore and use a separate pc for my plex server i just ordered the stick version and now hopefully i x27 m set for many years cheers ps anyone want a shield 2015 with msd card cheap of course both original controllers have died i x27 ll throw in an amazon fire basic remote that works over bluetooth lol edit ok enough interest already it x27 s pretty much sold i have spent a few days trying to figure out why the ufc app on my 2x nvidia shield tvs suddenly started showing me an error saying i was offline and to enable wi-fi my nvidia shield tv x27 s are connected just fine to the internet here is a photo of the error https //ibb.co/qvkjr4w the ufc androidtv app was updated on dec 4th 2019 i believe this is when the error started showing up the ufc app developers have messed-up their versioning system -march 29nd 2019 version 9.0318 was released -dec 4th 2019 version 1.2.0 was released not only did they change versioning systems from major.minor to major.minor.revision but they also changed the major version from 9 to 1 this prevents the nvidia shield and likely other androidtv devices from automatically updating the app via google play store google play will not see an update being available to fix this error you can uninstall the ufc app then use google play store to download it again it will pull down the latest 1.2.0 version when you do this i hope this information makes it to some other frusterated ufc fight pass fan i got a new tv that supports both dolby vision and hdr10+ it s a one of these so called smart tv which has bunch of apps which are slow as a rock on the other hand i love my 2017 shield tv which has no dv no hdr10+ while i understand the licensing woes that comes with dv but hdr10+ is open source amazon is doubling down on hdr10+ as well quite a big portion of the contents from prime video are hdr10+ so content-wise hdr10+ has lots of options so even though i would love to use my shield as a primary device i have to use either the sloppy interface or the tv or a fire stick to watch something with hdr10+ it s quite frustrating that a 25 device support but the shield can t. what we have seen so far is nvidia is willing to listen to their customers but to get this done we need to raise our voice to nvidia what we can do is raise our voice in threads like this for nvidia to know that there s a demand out there anyone try the disney+ update on the shield today is atmos working hi everyone i have a nvidia shield tv kodi plexkodiconnect setup i have this really annoying bug that i don t know how to fix basically after playing 4k hdr content and i exit out of the content press the stop button the tv won t switch back to standard mode from hdr mode so all the colors are super saturated/hdr looking how do i get it to switch back to standard mode automatically after exiting hdr content not sure if it s a shield tv issue kodi issue or lg oled tv issue could really use some help thanks i am having a big problem getting netflix or prime video to work they had both been working for the past couple years just fine until about 2 weeks ago i have confirmed that i am on 8.0.1 firmware good network connection no vpn or ad blockers i even did a complete factory reset when i try opening netflix the screen goes black for a second or two as if it is about to start and then the home page reappears can t get netflix to open at all prime video will at least open and allow me to choose something to watch but then errors out after about 10 seconds when i try to watch something i have logged out and back in many time with prime video tried clearing caches no idea what to try next or how to fix this any ideas 27.9k members 153 online may 21 2015 cake day
