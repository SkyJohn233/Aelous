Today Whole Foods Market’s  global       buyers and experts  revealed the most anticipated and innovative food       trends for 2019 in their fourth annual trends predictions announcement.       Pacific Rim flavors, eco-conscious packaging, faux meat snacks and new       varieties of hemp-infused products are among the food influences       expected to take off in the next year. The retailer’s seasoned       trend-spotters thoughtfully compiled this report based on more than 100       years of combined experience in product sourcing, studying consumer       preferences and participating in food and wellness industry exhibitions       worldwide.     This press release features multimedia. View the full release here:  https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181115005244/en/ Whole Foods Market Food Trends 2019 (Photo: Business Wire)   Whole Foods Market’s top 10 food trend predictions for 2019:       Flavor inspiration from the Pacific Rim (think Asia, Oceania and the       western coasts of North and South America) are popping up in grocery       stores and restaurants as people continue to explore more of the world       through their palates. Ingredients like longganisa (a Filipino pork       sausage), dried shrimp, cuttlefish and shrimp paste are on restaurant       and home menus that span from breakfast to dinner, while vibrant       tropical fruits such as guava, dragon fruit and passionfruit are making       their way into colorful smoothie bowls and cocktails. Jackfruit is a       popular meat alternative already being used in place of items like       barbecue pulled pork, while an extract of monk fruit, an       ultra-sweet-tasting fruit also known as  luo han guo , can be used       as a sweetener replacing added sugars. In the coming year, Whole Foods       Market and 365 Everyday Value brands will launch a limited collection of       refreshingly sweet products inspired by Pacific Rim fruits like guava       tropical vinaigrette, pineapple passionfruit sparkling mineral water,       mango pudding mix and passionfruit coconut frozen fruit bars.     Try the Trend:  Fresh produce like dragon fruit and star fruit;       Whole Foods Market Pineapple Passionfruit Tropical Sparkling Mineral       Water; 365 Everyday Value Passionfruit Coconut Swirl Fruit Bars; 365       Everyday Value Organic Strawberry Guava Pudding Mix; 365 Everyday Value       Guava Coconut Swirl Fruit Bars; 365 Everyday Value Pacific Rim Dried       Mixed Fruit with Jackfruit and Guava; 365 Everyday Value Guava Tropical       Vinaigrette,  Lakanto       Monkfruit Sweetener       Back in 2017, our experts predicted the naturally occurring probiotics       in  fermented       foods  like kimchi and “pickled everything” would blow up the food       world. In 2019, expect even more innovative probiotic integrations in       food — and not just in the supplement or refrigerated aisles. New       strains of probiotics such as Bacillus coagulans GBI-30 and Bacillus       coagulans MTCC 5856 are making more shelf-stable applications possible.       Wellness-focused brands are making it easier to get more probiotics in       your day by adding functional probiotic ingredients to your pantry       staples through products like granola, oatmeal, nut butters, soups and       nutrition bars. Another unexpected place shoppers can find probiotics is       in the cleaning aisle with brands like Counter Culture Probiotic       Cleaning Tonic, an all-purpose cleaner that utilizes probiotic cultures       and essential oils. Even beauty brands are including pre- and       probiotic-based ingredients through sunscreen and other topical body       care.     Try the Trend:  GoodBelly       Probiotics Crunchybars ; Effi Probiotic Chickpea Granola;  Pacifica       Sunset Sun + Skincare Mineral Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 ;  Vega       One Botanical Blends Organic All-In-One Shake With Ashwagandha Extract ;        Counter       Culture Probiotic Cleaning Tonic and all-purpose cleaner       Fats are making a comeback, and the trendiest diets are on board. With       the rising popularity of keto, paleo, grain-free and even “pegan” (paleo       + vegan) diets, plus a general shifting consumer mindset, fats are       starring ingredients in creative, convenient foods. Along with these       phat fats, higher protein and lower-carb combos will continue to trend       across simple and easy snacking categories. New integrations of fat       sources — like keto-friendly nutrition bars crafted with MCT oil powder,       coconut butter–filled chocolates, snacks affectionately called “fat       bombs” and a new wave of ready-to-drink vegan coffee beverages inspired       by butter coffees — are busting on the scene allowing consumers to get       their fat fill with convenient treats. Keep your eyes and taste buds       open for popcorn made with grass-fed ghee, multiple flavors of ghee that       range from sweet to savory, plus new variations on traditional meaty       snacks like chicken chips and thin, crisped beef jerky.     Try the Trend:  Fourth        &  Heart Madagascar Vanilla Bean Ghee Butter  made with grass-fed       ghee ;  Eating       Evolved Keto Cups ;  Keto-friendly       Dang Bars ;  Forager       Project Organic Coconut Cashewgurt ;  Love       Good Fats Plant-Based Bars ;  4505       Cracklins ;  Wilde       Chicken Chips ;  Vital       Proteins Mocha Coconut Collagen Creamer       Hemp hearts, seeds and oils are nothing new to food and body care lovers       — they’re in everything from waffle mix to dried pastas. (Even baby hemp       leaves have had their moment in the microgreens trends.) But a new       interest in the potential benefits stemming from other parts of hemp       plants has many brands looking to explore the booming cannabis biz.       While CBD oil is still technically taboo (prohibited in food, body care       and dietary supplements under federal law), retailers, culinary experts       and consumers can’t miss the cannabis craze when visiting food industry       trade shows, food innovators conferences or even local farmers markets.       But there’s more to this trend than CBD. Andalou Naturals has introduced       hemp plant stem cells in their CannaCell body care collection.       Non-cannabis-derived sources from the endocannabinoid system (which are       named after the cannabis plant that inspired their discovery), like       phytocannabinoids that exist in nature, are also becoming more visible       and prevalent due to the growing trend. It’s clear that hemp-derived       products are going mainstream, if not by wide distribution, then by word       of mouth!     Try the Trend:  Emerald       Health BioCeuticals EndoCalm Supplement ;  Andalou       CanaCell Harmony Botanical Body Lotion  &  Happy Day Cream ;  Manitoba       Harvest Organic Hemp Seeds       Eating more plants doesn’t mean you have to forgo beloved meaty flavors       and textures. Plant-based foods will continue to surprise and inspire —       this year taking on the meat-based snacking world of jerkies and pork       rinds you may associate with the corner store and road trips. While       plant-based foods aren’t exactly a new trend, our experts noted more       people — even those who don’t eat only vegan or vegetarian — are       exploring plant-based snacking as their palates crave adventure, want a       break from meat or seek more ways to add savory umami flavors into       snacks and meals. Mushrooms like king trumpet will play a key role here,       flexing their flavor and texture powers in tasty jerky, “pork” rinds and       “bacon” snacks (used in both Pig Øut Pigless Bacon Chips and Snacklins       Cracklins Without the Pork) to offer up a satisfying crunch. Beyond       these reinvented veggies and plant-based products, vegetarians can       indulge in Quevos Egg White Chips for even more snacking.     Try the Trend:  Snacklins       Cracklins Without The Pork ; Louisville       Vegan Jerky Co. ;  Pig       Øut Chipotle Pigless Bacon Chips       The number of brands making the switch to packaging with the environment       in mind continues to grow at a quickening pace. Dozens of like-minded       brands in the  OSC 2        Compostable Packaging Collaborative  have pooled their efforts       to make important advances in flexible product pouches. Some companies       are making commitments to ban straws, while brands like Whole Foods       Market are setting up regional pilots to test recyclable strawless,       sipper lids made from PET, without increasing the plastic content of a       lid/straw combination. Expect to see an emphasis on reusing, with more       produce departments going “BYOVB” (bring your own vegetable bag) and       traditionally single-use packages going multi-use, like multi-use (and       compostable!) food wraps made from beeswax, as well as waxed canvas or       silicone alternatives to the usual plastic storage bags that can be used       for sandwiches and snacks. Some movements start as trends, then become       necessities. This is one of them.     Try the Trend:  Square       Organics bars ;  Numi       Organic Tea ;  Alter       Eco chocolate bars ;  Nutiva ;        Lotus       Foods ;  Flow       Alkaline Spring Water ;  Seed       Phytonutrients Daily Hair Cleanser and hair care line ;  Dr.       Bronner’s Pure Castile Soap ;  Lunchskins       Recyclable + Sealable Paper Sandwich Bags       While there is something comforting and classic about a scoop of vanilla       ice cream, some consumers are wanting something a little less, well,       vanilla. The new pints on the block are adding a fresh take on a       timeless treat with innovative bases like avocado, hummus, tahini and       coconut water. Look down specialty frozen aisles and you might find       plant-based frozen desserts like CocoWhip Soft Serve and ice creams with       savory swirls of artisanal cheese (and don’t think you’ll stop seeing       those low calorie, high protein players in the frozen aisle anytime       soon). Globally-inspired frozen desserts are taking the stage — possibly       sparked by 2018’s  mochi       ice cream obsession  and a Thai rolled ice cream craze — with icy       indulgences like airy Taiwanese snow ice and Mexican nieves de garrafa,       not to mention stretchy, chewy, Turkish ice creams that get their unique       texture from mastic and other unique sources. Popsicles and gelatos       won’t be left out of the fun — they’ll get some buzz with boozier       infusions coming to market.     Try the Trend:  Cado       Avocado Non-Dairy Frozen Desserts ;  Seed       + Mill Tahini Soft Serve at Whole Foods Market Bryant Park ;  Jeni’s       Sorbet Frosé ;  CocoWhip       Soft Serve at Whole Foods Market Lamar ;  Dolcezza       Mascarpone and Berries Gelato ; Cold Crush Ultra Premium Ice Cream,       Sweet Cream Rhubarb; Vegan mochi ice cream           Seaweed snacks rose to popularity a few years back and are now enjoyed       by health-conscious adults and toddlers alike, however, our experts       expect even more ocean influence in the grocery aisles in the year to       come. Think beyond seaweed snacks. Sea greens are showing up in dishes       like seaweed butter and kelp noodles while consumers are exploring new       depths of ocean flavors with superfood properties like unique varietals       of algae and kelp. Puffed snacks made from water lily seeds, plant-based       tuna alternatives with algae ingredients, crispy snackable salmon skins       with omega-3s and kelp jerkies are just a few testing the waters. A       salty sea fennel and olive blend will debut on Whole Foods Market olive       bars in 2019, and brands like Ocean’s Halo include kelp as an ingredient       in all their miso and ramen broths, condiments and sauces.     Try the Trend:  Good       Catch Fish-Free Tuna made with algae ; Sea Fennel Olive Blend on       Whole Foods Market store olive bars ;  Ocean’s       Halo broths ,  condiments       and sauces ; Nature’s       Way Algae Oil capsules ;  EPIC       Salmon Fillet Smoked Maple Strips       Snacking across the board will take a turn toward the fancy, and snacks,       as they start to usurp the usual three-meals-a-day routine, are anything       but ordinary. Snacking has become an occasion of its very own — think       charcuterie or cheese boards for one, one-ounce portions of Cypress       Grove cheeses paired with demi-baguettes as desk snacks and more mini       meals. More takes on snacking nod to the comforting treats of your       second grade lunchbox, with better ingredients. Portable snack packages       will feature bites like prosciutto and aged mozzarella, and artisanal       versions of classic snacks like cheese or peanut butter cracker       sandwiches. Ingredient-conscious snack and treat makers are creating new       packaged snacks that take us back to our treat-loving childhoods but       with higher quality ingredients, some of which are updated to       accommodate special diets. Upgraded retro treats will star on 2019’s       shelves — candy-coated Project 7 Organic Chewies burst with intense       fruit flavor and are gluten free; Smashmallow’s marshmallow and puffed       rice treats are gluten free and made with organic sugar; Little Secrets       Crispy Wafers are long crunchy rectangles dipped in fair trade chocolate.     Try the Trend:  Cypress       Grove 1-ounce artisanal fresh goat cheeses ;  Creminelli       Fine Meats artisan charcuterie snack packs ;  Goodie       Girl Cookies ; 365 Everyday Value Organic Pretzel Pieces (Hot Pepper       Jelly and Southwest Jalapeño Ranch flavors); 365 Everyday Value PB        Gone Gourmet Trail Mix;  Gluten-free       Quinn Peanut Butter Filled Pretzels ;  Fuller       Foods Serious Cheesy Puffs ;  Project       7 Organic Chewies ;  Little       Secrets Dark Chocolate Pieces  and  Crispy       Wafers ;  Smashmallow       Marshmallow Rice Treats       Much like last year’s  Transparency       2.0 trend , consumer purchasing power continues to motivate changes       in the food, beverage and body care industries, as shoppers expect more       from the brands and businesses they choose to support. In 2019,       thoughtful consideration behind purchases moves beyond (but doesn’t       exclude!) environmental stewardship and animal welfare, and becomes more       people-focused. Greyston Bakery practices an open hiring model — no       questions asked — to practice what they call “radical inclusion,” which       includes anyone who has faced barriers to employment. Kuli Kuli produces       moringa powder which is often grown and processed by women, and has       provided more than $1.5 million in income to women-led farming       cooperatives, nonprofits and family farmers around the world through       their organic moringa supply chain.  Whole       Planet Foundation  partners with suppliers such as Chobani, Frontier       Co-op, Naked Juice, Wallaby Organic, Papyrus-Recycled Greetings and more       to alleviate poverty through microcredit loans for the world’s poorest       people — mostly women — who become empowered microentrepreneurs lifting       themselves and their families out of poverty. Media outlets like  Cherry       Bombe Magazine  make it easy to find and support women-owned       businesses and female chefs in your community, while inspiring       discussions on how to move the industry forward together. Contributing       toward social movements via purchasing goods and services with missions       you believe in can make for big changes that extend far beyond the world       of retail.     Try the Trend:  Kuli       Kuli Pure Moringa Vegetable Powder ;  Greystone       Bakery Brownies and Blondies ;  Alaffia       Whipped Shea Butter  &  Coconut Oil ;  Women’s       Bean Project baking and soup mixes ;  Ground       Up almond and cashew butters ;  Wild       Ophelia By Vosges Haut-Chocolat chocolate bars and chocolate coffee bites ;        Whole       Trade produce at Whole Foods Market       This year’s predictions came from Whole Foods Market’s culinary experts       and industry leaders who source items and lead trend-spotting       initiatives across the retailer’s more than 490 stores.
