Their top unit has played poorly against starters from other teams, and they have to step up their performance in order to play better. However, despite the poor play of the starters, the Redskins may elect to carry just eight linemen going into the season opener. The reasoning is simple. While the starters have not been great, the backups have not shown much either. So the Redskins may decide that some other positions are more important to have depth at, and that could cause them to carry less on the offensive line. They also could elect to sign a veteran to occupy the ninth slot, and  Nick Mangold is a good option  in the wake of  Spencer Long ’s injury. It does help the Redskins cause that backup  Ty Nsekhe  is such a good tackle. Nsekhe is one of the best swing tackles in the league, and if the Redskins really felt the need to replace  Shawn Lauvao  in the starting lineup, Nsekhe could possibly play guard or shift  Trent Williams  inside to help the team out. The most notable bubble name of this group is  Arie Kouandjio . The third year guard was expected to step up and possibly win a starting spot, but he has instead regressed badly. Kounadjio seems likely to get cut by the Redskins. They simply don’t need an unreliable guard to be a backup for them. Right now, it seems more likely that they would keep an undrafted rookie like Kyle Kalis. However, they could probably get him to the practice squad and call him up if needed during the season. This is going to be a position to watch in preseason Week 3. With the bad performance thus far, Jay Gruden is going to be looking to find players who can step up and play well. If a backup shines, that may be enough to win him a spot on the team’s initial 53-man roster.

Here\u2019s a look at our updated predictions for the final roster after Week 2 of the preseason. < \/h2>\n Making the roster cut to 53 is never an easy thing for any NFL team. In the modern NFL, it\u2019s even harder. With the elimination of the cut to 75, a new rule as of this year, teams are allowed to carry 90 players until it is time to pare down the roster to 53. Because of this, all teams, including the Washington Redskins, are able to get a longer look at some of their guys on the roster bubble. < \/p>\n At the same time, the lack of a first cut gives teams a chance to collect more and more observations and data about players. While that could be a good thing on the surface, it could also make decisions difficult if they are trying to find 37 players to cut, instead of cutting 15 in one go and then 22 in another. To put it simply, it\u2019s not easy to create a perfect 53-man roster. < \/p>\n Just over a week ago, we took a crack at  predicting the Redskins 53-man roster  < \/a>for the first time. Our projections were basically balanced on both sides of the ball, with equal numbers of offensive and defensive players. However, after preseason Week 2, it is going to be harder for the Redskins to pass up on keeping some of the defensive players that they have on the roster. < \/p>\n Without further ado, here\u2019s a look at our updated predictions for the Redskins 53-man roster, post preseason Week 2. < \/p>\n \n     \n         Next:  < \/span>\n        Quarterbacks\n     < \/a>\n < \/div>
