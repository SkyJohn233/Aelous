Mums have been dropping off their children at school and then rushing off to fashion shows or events, dressed-to-impress. I am someone who appreciates fashion: I enjoy looking it at and wearing it, but you wouldn t say I am a  fashionista  unlike friends of mine including  Smart Fashionista  who has 167K followers because of what she wears (hey, we all have our strengths). I am not fashion forward enough, and I like my clothes comfortable (read: leggings and sweaters uniform) for the school run. But this week, I was busy with my own fashion collaborations with a book signing and talk at Anya Hindmarch on Tuesday for my book  The Beta Mum, Adventures in Alpha Land . On Thursday, I was invited to an exclusive  Cars and Fashion  Ralph Lauren event.  I love both brands and actually have both brands in my closet so makes for the perfect fashion week invitations. (Let s face it, there is some fashion that is great to see on a runway but not necessarily to wear). My book signing table! Loved it. NHYM 2017.  On Tuesday, I was invited to do a small private talk, reading, book signing and Q & A session  at Anya Hindmarch in their Sloane Street shop with the  Kensington and Chelsea Women s Club , a group of international women in London. They were a lovely, thoughtful and enthusiastic group. It was also a chance to browse Anya Hindmarch s new Fall  17 collection, while sipping on wine and discussing the trials and tribulations of writing a book. This fall s highlight to me was Anya Hindmarch s  Build a Bag  concept, which is great fun. You take a bag, and add lots of fun accessories. I particularly like the fluffy pompoms to add to any bag (or at least my girls would love them). Anya s fall collection was a perfect collaboration because it is playful, fun and colourful, which is how I think The Beta Mum should be read. Next up, I was invited to a cars and fashion Ralph Lauren event at their New Bond Street store last night. The perfect combination, it appealed to men and women: boys and their toys and girls and their dresses. Some things never change whether you are 5 years old or 50 years old. The event was hosted by the beautiful Yasmin Le Bon and had lots of Ferraris around. This was my absolute favourite room with a red, black and white palette of colours; sleek, sophisticated and luxurious. I love RL for those reasons and hopefully there may be a future collaboration in the making. I loved both events, although they were very different. Anya Hindmarch s collection is channeling colours and fun, while Ralph Lauren is channeling sleek and sophisticated, but I d like to think that I can work both styles! Another Fashion week comes to an end and the fashion houses can breathe again next week, until the next one. Thank you  Anya Hindmarch  for hosting my book signing and thank you  Ralph Lauren  for inviting me to this great event! xx NHYM http://www.nottinghillyummymummy.com @NHyummymummy Portovenere, Italy.

I took the summer off from writing and promoting my book,  The Beta Mum, Adventures in Alpha Land.  Frankly, it was quite wonderful forgetting about book sales and anything related   although I did manage a radio interview with Irish Radio RTE sitting by the pool, and did manage to appear in The Sun! No, not as a Page Three girl but still. This summer, I took the last few weeks of August and travelled around Italy and France with trains/planes/boats/automobiles and even Tuk Tuks, for our first cultural family holiday starting in  Florence  and ending in France. It was the Dolce Vita with history, art, cooking and geography lessons as well as showing my children how others live in small Italian towns. Vernazza, Italy. NHYM 2017. Coming back to London the Sunday before school started was a big shocker. People ask how my kids are adapting to being back-to-school (they love it), but really they should be asking me how it feels to be back-to-reality. Yes, I know you shouldn t feel sorry for me, most people have been working all summer, but I am having  re-entry-into-London-adjustment-issues.  Friends of ours have left London to live in Spain/France/the countryside/Switzerland and sometimes when I return to the frantic-ness of school gates/school-uniforms/tutors/tests and stress, I always wonder whether this is what I want.

We are in a vibrant, cultural, dynamic hub of Europe and as I receive invitations to great events, I am reminded that this is where things happen. The Frieze is coming up so soon, reminding me that London is an art centre of the world, as well as a talk from the CEO of Sotheby s I am hoping to attend. I am in talks with a charity, which would hopefully involve me in something greater than myself or my  bubble.   Finally, London is where I wrote and published my first book, which has overall been such a great creative experience. I have my own upcoming events, which are quite exciting. Next week, I am having an event with Anya Hindmarch on Tuesday, and in a few weeks time, I have an event with  3HouseClub in St. John s Wood for NW8mums . Only in London would I get these great collaboration opportunities. How great is this e-vite? I absolutely love it so had to share it. (Please contact me on nottinghillyummymummy@hotmail.com if you are interested in coming to any of my events) I also have a potentially exciting project in the pipeline   which may or may not come to fruition, but even just having these discussions is creatively wonderful. And of course, I am reminded every day how great it is to be in such an international, tolerant, open-minded, educated city when I look around the restaurants, the school gates, and even while walking down the street, and I know this is where I am meant to be right now. So here s to being Back-to-School, Back-to-Reality, and Back-to-London. I hope you have had a wonderful start to your   school   year! xx NHYM http://www.nottinghillyummymummy.com @NHyummymummt Enter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.
