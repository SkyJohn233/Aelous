If you turn back the bodybuilding clock, you ' ll no doubt remember that old stand by, the  " weight gainer. "  You probably picked up an economy-sized bottle when you were playing high school football - before you became a competitive bodybuilder. Along with the  Animal Pak , a quality weight gainer was probably one of the first supplements you ever used. For years, supplement companies sold tons of this stuff. Why? Because it worked. Today, the weight gainer has lost much of its popularity. And over the years, the weight gainer has changed very little. But whether you grew up bodybuilding in the 1980s, 1990s or today, one thing remains certain: to bulk up and put on quality muscle weight, you need plenty of calories. And when you can ' t eat any more, you need more calories.  For most of us, putting on weight is a simple process (for some, all too easy). Eat more of everything - quality protein, whole foods, vegetables, eggs, milk, fruits, good fats, and the like. For others, gaining weight is a difficult proposition. You have a hard time eating every three hours. You always feel full. Maybe you ' re a  " hard gainer "  who can ' t seem to put on weight no matter how you try or how much you eat. Gain Fast has been designed to fuel your body with quality calories.* But sometimes, even mega-calories aren ' t enough. Sometimes you need something more, something like muscle boosters, performance herbs, natural plant sterols, EFAs, digestive enzymes, and muscle optimizers.* We ' re talking about ingredients like L-arginine, MCTs, IGF colostrum, L-carnosine, vanadyl sulfate, plant sterols (e.g., beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, fucosterol, campesterol), inosine, ginseng, pyridoxine alpha-ketoglutarate (PAK), choline, inositol monophosphate, and other good stuff.  Directions For Gain Fast:  Mix 5 scoops of Gain Fast™ with 16 oz. of your beverage of choice. Mix thoroughly (preferably in a blender with crushed ice for a rich, thick, delicious, frosty milk shake). For best results, take one to three servings of Gain Fast™ daily in addition to regular meals. Use in conjunction with a proper training and nutrition program.

Hey guys so ive never written a Review in my life but this protein powder has to be addressed.....DONT BUY THIS! after trying the shake for my first time i passed out from the ingredients and projectile vommitted everywhere  FOR THE LOVE THAT IS ALL HOLY DONT BUY THIS GARBAGE                             Has carbo syn in it works best with food cheapest protein for best results. Been working out for 46 days seen extreme results                              I ' ve been using Gain Fast for 2 years now, and definitely seen increase in strength and mass. Never used full serving size, only half of it per day with skimmed milk - as I only needed 700 calories plus... Good stuff!                             this was the first supplement i ever bought back in 2014 and it was so bad , it didn ' t mix i would always end up moving it from the shaker to a mixer or i would use a spoon just to try to mix it  , it tasted bad , and literally did nothing                              does not mix great plus got a pepper taste while drinking it                             This is one of the worst protein supplements I have used. I was pretty shocked considering the quality of all other Universal products I ' ve purchased. I have used Universal Gains and Mass, and they have been fantastic. The reason I rated this product higher than taste, is because it didn ' t give me any GI issues like a cheap protein. It seemed to digest fine, but the taste... ughh. It doesn ' t blend well at all, even two scoops in 12oz liquid doesn ' t shake. It lumps, sticks to the sides like mud, and even after finally blended and smashed and stirred with a spoon, there are little white lumps and grainy spots. The chocolate is terrible and has a very odd aftertaste like cayenne pepper. It also leaves a slimy film in your mouth. Never Again.                             Decent gainer shake with really just about all you need to put on mass.    Thicker than Real Gains by a longshot, higher carbs and sugars so that is the reason why.   CNC is ok but it does not stand out to me, has a faint smokey type of flavor but not a definite cnc.   Banana Split Shake is bolder and more delicious when you open it up you get hit with this marshmellow banana aroma, ultimately it is my favorite so far, by far.  Mix is average for one scoop for a gainer, dont recommend 2-3 in a sitting unless you plan to sit for a while tryina drink it all down a scoop aint so bad, definitely is filling,  For the price you cant go wrong for the big tub helped me add 3 lbs in a month after plateauing in the wintertime.  Increased my calories, cant say it is better than Real Gains but I can tell you it is the best value in a gainer there is from what I ' ve found.                             oh Man! this one gonna make your stomach diarrhea all over the place!thump down !                             I used 2.5lbs but not seen a difference.not recommended                             The taste is good. It actually taste like an ice cream bar. However, I found this product contains way too much sugar.                              I bought the Cookies and Cream the taste was really eh...Overall it helped me hit my macros and the Sugar intake is just too much in here...
