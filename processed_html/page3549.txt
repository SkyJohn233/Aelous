Jasmine Jonte - Home | Facebook I’ve walked a million miles  To chase down my own desires   Out of fire, sea and stone  Born to find that great unknown   And   When I find myself   Im’ma bring it on home  **********************  The magic is where you are.   Never are you without it.   You are the love, the magic you’re looking for.   And when you have a moment of loneliness, thinking that you are without our personal growth family, see the illusion.   We walk with you. We are in the words you say and the feels you feel. We are in every learning come alive.   And when you have a moment of doubt, thinking that some seminar something or seminar someone was only a fantasy, never to be had in physical reality, see the illusion.   You are faith in human form. That “fantasy” is only your beginning. And it’s coming sooner than you think BECAUSE you feel doubt and choose to see the illusion anyway. You choose to believe.   And when you are called crazy, Koolaid, or the like, say thank you. That’s the best time to practice all that we have learned. What a gift.   Be in love with the naysayers, because your gentle, quiet certainty is mountains stronger than loud, weak words.   And your gentle, quiet certainty teaches. It shows that there is another way.   You leave footsteps to follow.   Not just empty quotes.   We are here, we are in personal growth, because we have been called to give.   We have been called to help the world evolve to peace. To compassion.   Loving kindness is our way.   Be happy to be home.   In the midst of all of it.   Because the seminar vacuum helps us grow, but it’s outside the vacuum that the world changes.   And you, my darling, are the difference maker.   As always - check on your strong friends. If you feel like other difference makers need this message today, please share.   I love you. Thank you. Before 2020...
