sucked the administration which they currently have is some of the worst people in charge when you tell the school about your problems they definitely don t care they talk down to you and treat you like it is your fault they don t understand the amount of stress they put on students and they simply do not care about students read 43 reviews alum xa0 i loved dominican and miss it every single day i made my best friends here and we had great experiences together the teachers wanted us to succeed and it showed through their personality and work ethic we valued religion and always stressed to listen and respect people s opinions even when they were different from our own we valued culture and even had a day to celebrate different cultures from around the world with outfits singing and dancing i had great relationships with my teachers and was able to be myself and feel comfortable asking questions teachers were available to answer questions after school and were willing to help as much as they could i believe dominican is even better than when i left they have a brand new building that focuses on the important connection between science and religion i truly believe that dominican has shaped me into the young woman i am today and i am extremely grateful for having the opportunity to grow and learn there read 177 reviews junior xa0 mount carmel academy is a great high
