pset 8 mashup search() return either all results or no results - CS50 Stack Exchange                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 Here is my code. As mentioned above, it either returns all the results or returns no results. Thanks You can limit the number of search results returned by using  LIMIT n  where n is some whole number, at the end of the Select query. for eg.  SELECT * FROM table WHERE x LIKE y LIMIT 10 . Also you dont have to use different variables for each  LIKE . What I mean is you can just use one variable like  request  for all  LIKE s and then at the end you can say  request = searchrequest , as all the values for  LIKE  are same. I put the postal_code field as integer instead of text 2019 Stack Exchange, Inc
