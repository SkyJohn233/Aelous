Listen Geordie Williamson grew up near the Belanglo State Forest in New South Wales. While he was still a boy, he and his younger brother James helped build the family's mud-brick house. Geordie and James were given a lot of freedom to roam around the bush as kids, and often went on lengthy bushwalks by themselves. When Geordie arrived at Sydney University, he began studying English. Then he discovered the story of Evariste Galois, who had solved a famous maths problem at the age of 16, before he was killed in a duel when he was 20. From that moment, Geordie became hooked on maths.  He discovered he possessed the kind of mind which could unlock the poetry and abstraction of extremely complicated mathematics. Geordie recently solved a decades-old problem about the weight of atoms in space called the Lusztig Conjecture, after working on it for eight years. In 2018, at the age of 36, he was named the youngest living member of Britain's Royal Society.
