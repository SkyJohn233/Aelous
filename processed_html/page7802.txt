Theater Review: ‘Funny Girl’ goes over the top at Players Centre - Entertainment  &  Life - Sarasota Herald-Tribune - Sarasota, FL Late in the second act of \"Funny Girl\" at the Players Centre, Vera Samuels steps through a curtain as comedienne Fanny Brice and touches your heart singing \"The Music That Makes Me Dance.\" It's one of a few songs from the stage version of the show that wasn't featured in the hit film, and it comes after Fanny has achieved great success as a Ziegfeld Follies star but feels like a failure at home after her gambler husband Nick Arnstein has been charged with embezzlement. Fanny sings about whether she loves Nick too much to allow him to feel like his own man, and not just Mr. Fanny Brice, and Samuels sings it with honest emotions. But it's a long wait to get to those feelings. Just about everything that comes before in Helen Holliday's production, especially in the lighter and more comedic first act, feels bloated and over-the-top. Aside from Christopher Kehoe's handsome and grounded performance as Nick and Patrick Tancey as Fanny's loyal friend and dance coach Eddie Ryan, the cast members too often look like they're performing rather than just being their characters. Samuels is one of the area's more spirited performers, but she doesn't need to try so hard to win over the audience. She is sarcastically funny, particularly during \"His Love Makes Me Beautiful,\" in which she spoofs a typical follies showcase, and anticipating a night of romance in \"You Are Woman, I Am Man.\" To her great credit, you don't spend the evening making comparisons to Barbra Streisand, who so iconically created the role on stage and film. Samuels' performance makes sense at the start of when Fanny is young and desperate and willing to try almost anything to be discovered, but even then we really never get to see what's so special about her because we are not seeing and hearing her at her best. When she's singing softly, as in the that final number or the tender start to \"People,\" she sounds sweet and compelling, but too often Samuels pushes her voice toward breathless screaming. A more understated performance might allow the audience to fully appreciate what made Brice so unique and special. The cast also includes Andrea Keddell, who has great gumption as Fanny's mother, Rose, and makes you see where Fanny got her drive. But Keddell also plays the role broadly, making you think that Rose is competing with Fanny for attention instead of basking in her daughter's glory. Sharon Bartley plays one of Rose's busybody, poker-playing neighbors and Craig Engle plays Ziegfeld with a bit of command that gives way to Fanny's persuasive charms. There are some fun dance routines choreographed by Brian Finnerty that include a lively military tap number to \"Rat-tat-tat-tat\" and a touch of showgirl elegance. The show is filled with some gorgeous Jule Styne songs matched to meaningful lyrics by Bob Merrill, though the tender \"Who Are You Now\" is missing. While the orchestra led by musical director Michelle Neal sounds supportive when the cast members are singing, the music sounds thin during the overture and entr'acte. The production features an attractive set by Michael Newton-Brown of twin, movable staircases and lots of seemingly simple set pieces that slide or fly in as needed to take the audience from Fanny's home to the Ziegfeld theater and a Long Island mansion. Patrick Bedell's lighting has some impact, and Tim Beltley's costumes capture both the spirit of the era and Fanny's growth from teenager to star. \"Funny Girl\" essentially rides on the back of its leading lady and Samuels has the charisma and chutzpah to help you root for Fanny. But more subtlety could bring even greater life to the production. 'Funny Girl' Music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Bob Merrill, book by Isobel Lennart. Directed by Helen Holliday.
