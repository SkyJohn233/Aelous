spoj.com problem solving here we will deal with a generalized version of the above puzzle you should write a program that given some initial state of the nxn board finds a sequence of moves that transforms it so that in the i-th row there are tiles withnumbers i*n+1 i*n+2 i*n+n from left to right with the exception of the lower right corner where the hole should be the less moves you use the more points you get the first line of input contains the number of test cases c c =200 then c test cases follow each of them begins with a line with a single integer n 3 =n =10 in it the next n lines describe the initial state of the board the i-th line consists of exactly n integers describing the i-th row the position of the hole is indicated by 0 for each test case output one line the found sequence of moves write 'd to move the hole down u to move it up r to move it right and l to move it left you should n't use more than 10000 moves all moves should be valid so for example do n't try to move the hole up when it is in the first row your program will receive n^3/ m+1 points for each test case where m is the number of moves about tutorial tools clusters credits api widgets legal terms of service privacy policy gdpr info using adblock please whitelist *.spoj.com
