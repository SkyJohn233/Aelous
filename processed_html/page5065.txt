Minnesota Vikings: Top 20 games in franchise history - Page 8 14. Biggest comeback in Vikings history Dec. 4, 1977. The Vikings staged the biggest comeback in franchise history, rallying from 24 down to beat the 49ers. For nearly three full quarters the 49ers dominated the Vikings, opening up a seemingly insurmountable 24-0 lead. Quarterback Bob Lee got the Vikes on the board in the third quarter with a TD pass to Brent McClanahan then left the game. Rookie first round draft pick Tommy Kramer came in for Lee and absolutely blew up. Kramer threw eight-yard TD passes to Ahmad Rashad and Bob Tucker to pull the Vikings within three points. A field goal put the 49ers back up by six. But the Vikings and Kramer weren t done just yet. The rookie uncorked a 69-yard TD pass to Sammy White to give the Vikings a 28-27 victory. The 24-point comeback still stands as the largest in Vikings history. Kramer s epic performance helped establish his reputation for late-game heroics. < \/p>\n A few ground rules I established for myself when ranking the top 20 games in Vikings franchise history. < \/p>\n Rule #1: No Vikings losses. The 1998 NFC title game may have been objectively great but it will be found nowhere on this list. < \/p>\n Rule #2: Playoff games will not automatically be given precedence over games featuring historic individual performances or great team feats like huge comebacks. < \/p>\n Rule #3: An honest effort will be made to avoid being biased toward more recent events. However, I can t guarantee that such a bias will be entirely eliminated. < \/p>\n A person can t help favoring games they witnessed themselves over ones they only heard about or saw on replay years after the fact. < \/p>\n Rule #4: Have fun with it! < \/p>\n Here s what I came up with. Shout out to Adam Carlson for writing up some of the games. < \/p>\n Next:  < \/span> Joe Kapp's huge day < \/span> < \/a> < \/div>
