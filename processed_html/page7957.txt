Suresh Raina s top 10 innings in international cricket   Page 3   CricketTimes.com Raina played both the 2011 and 2015 World cups and he had pretty decent world cup stats. In the opening match against Pakistan in 2015, when Virat Kohli was setting things up for the team with his century, Raina provided the impetus with a blistering 74 off just 56 balls. This is something which is always expected of him, whenever he gets going he scores with 100+ strike rate and gives the required momentum in the middle overs. It is unfair to relate Raina s contribution by his numbers because with Sachin Tendulkar, Sehwag, Yuvraj and Gambhir in the team he always had to play in the lower middle order. But his 34 off just 28 balls in the quarterfinals of the 2011 world cup was as important as the half-century. India struggled a bit after losing MS Dhoni on 187 and India still needed 73 runs with only 5 wickets in hand. When all eyes were on Yuvraj Singh, Raina played a superb cameo to take India to the semis. The UP lad has few significant knocks in overseas conditions which can blow your mind. India always struggled in New Zealand but this time MS Dhoni had some other plans for kiwis with Suresh Raina to help. The match was shortened to 38 overs due to rains but Raina s quick 66 in 39 balls took India to a solid position and India won the match by 53 runs. Quick runs got 4 sixes and 5 fours in it.
