Looking for advice for clearing bathroom sink clog : DIY Hi all, I &# x27;m kinda new to home diy so please bare with me if I ask any seemingly obvious questions here I have a sink that &# x27;s been clogged for about 6 months now. Total neglect on my part, I tried to clear it at the point it had clogged, then life got in the way and since it &# x27;s a not often used sink already, we forgot to get back around to trying to clear it again until now. It &# x27;s a total blockage, not one ounce of water will move if you leave any in the basin. So far I &# x27;ve tried plunging and it hasn &# x27;t done any thing but bring up brown water from the pipes. I &# x27;ve tried auger (drum auger by hand, no drill) in from the drain on top but met a point not that far in, maybe 6 feet or so, where I could not get the auger to go any further. I pulled the auger out and there was a wad of hair on  the end, and the drain was draining just a tiny amount. So i cleared the tip and tried again. Could only go the same legth, not any further, i pull the auger out and the tip was still clean (ish ). But the drain completely stopped again and hasn &# x27;t drained at all since then. I tried drano max gel and it made no difference, and I spent the day slowly working on removing what I could of the drano from the pipes, in case it would damage them. I took the p trap off to see if it would be any better augering from there , but unfortunately not. I can only get the snake about 2 feet past the wall before it just refuses to budge. For what it &# x27;s worth the bathtub in that bathroom got clogged at the same time as the sink and I was able to sucess fully auger that drain. At the time when I plunged the tub water pushed up into the sink basin that was able to slowly drain out still at that point. I dunno if this is useful information or not. Is it likely at this point I &# x27;ll need to rent a power auger? Or is there something else I should try? I &# x27;d just like to do all I can before calling a professional, so any insight from someone with more experience would be greatly appreciated! Thank you! Rent a small power auger, no need for the larger  ones inside. Start from where the ptrap is removed - it &# x27;s just easier. push the auger as far as it will go. While you have it, do the tub drain, too. When it &# x27;s clear and back together, put a few gallons of hot tap water down both drains. Get something to keep hair out of the drains to prevent this in the future. source: balding old guy Call and plumbing company and explain previous steps. All the drainos/etc should work with sinks. Have you had a party or children? Wtf was put down the sink?? Hair and soap combine to create killer clogs. The only thing that Iâ€™ve found that clears them is boiling water, like from a screaming tea kettle boiling hot. That plus plugging the sinks overflow port with a wet washcloth and plunging the drain with a plunger. Once the drain starts draining continue pouring boiling hot water down it until it drains fully. Only me and my boyfriend live here, and no parties. The only thing that ever went down the drainin that bathroom to our knowledge was a piece of a plastic decoration once in the tub, but we were able to retrieve that. The sink has one of those plugged stoppers (removed only for augering) so nothing big enough to clog the drain could have gotten into it really during the time we &# x27;ve lived here. We &# x27;d only lived here for about 7 months before the clogs happened though. The hair I pulled from the tub drain was monstrous; enough to make a small disgusting stuffed animal. And the hair that came from the sink was also a sizable amount for a sink in my opinion, so I really have no idea what is in the sink drain really. Looks like I &# x27;ll just have to bite the bullet and pay someone to fix it. Can &# x27;t say I didn &# x27;t try~ You should never mix drano with anything, especially drains, because drano eats pipes. Yeah I &# x27;d be too paranoid to put anything else in there at this point. I did what I could to remove hopefully most of it but I &# x27;d hate to melt my pipes or fumigate my house by accident. If there &# x27;s no other option I &# x27;ll call a plumber over for this. I just wanted to try everything in my own power first. 16.8m DIYers 15.7k Online Jan 25, 2008 Cake Day
