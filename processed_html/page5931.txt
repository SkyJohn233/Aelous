Mmmm Mmmm! Delish! What a great comfort food. I didn ' t add the beef broth, this recipe doesn ' t need it. The cabbage  &  onions will get tender enough in the skillet with just the butter. A+!         This was delicious!!!  I made this using the  " Pierogi (Polish Dumpling) "  recipe on this site intesd of using frozen.  Also, I cooked the onion and cabbage for a little bit, then added no sodium ...         Our favorite recipe using kielbasa.  I pre-cook the kielbasa on the grill for added flavor.

I ended up cutting keilbsas into 1/2 moons, and mixed it all together to cook after the initial cabbage and onion cooked for a whole. Served with mustard to dip sausages in.         I thought it was great. Smelled yummy, tasted yummy. I used the broth, but didn '  t follow the cooking instructions, kind of just used one pot - started w/cabbage and onions, threw in the pierogi...         There is no need to call them to dinner, the smell of this cooking takes care of that. This is a five star meal! I followed the recipe except I added a sprinkle of smoked paprika with the salt  & ...         Made  as is without the cabbage (I didn ' t have any) and it was delicious! Nice change from how I usually make kielbasa.         These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.
