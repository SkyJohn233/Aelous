Homeless woman - Jamaicans.com Dedicate to all who face adversity She holds her head up high As frigid blisters upon her feet Reminding her of her struggle, of her plight In a wintery night, she feels the chills running down her spine Has her tears become frozen, She keeps the vision of hope Alive And for a second, she smells the scent of spring She heard the sound of joy Sharing stories of her youth uttered tales of love She felt she never had, Beckoned,invoked intimacy to her spirit And for a moment, she forgot Emptiness For a moment she forgot pain. ©2008 Maxine Foster [Empress Spirit] Join our newsletter to get the latest articles, news,  &  videos.
