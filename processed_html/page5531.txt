Where are the best places for souvenirs???? Help ASAP - South Padre Island Forum - TripAdvisor Hi guys - I am here at my awesome condo and loving every minute of it!!! I need some suggestions for some good shopping - want to pick up some t-shirts and other souvenirs that are good quality and reasonably priced. There are too many shops to choose from and some are over priced while others are cheep quality. Thanks in advance! P.S. I cannot find B & S seafood / there number is disconnected. Are they closed?  Can ' t give advice on the t-shirt shops...they are all the same to me.
