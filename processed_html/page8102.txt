Worn by students as they walk the hallways of American high school, hang out by their lockers or ride the bus home at the end of the day.  The letterman jacket is a staple of US culture, representing America’s diverse history of sports, extra-curricular opportunities and one-of-a-kind high school spirit. No one letterman jacket is the same, but most display the same core patches. Numerals, stars, bars or chevron stripes indicate how many years the athlete has played on a Varsity team or what grade the jacket-wearer is in. It’s common to add these patches on yearly as the student advances from freshman to sophomore, junior and senior. The name of the owner is embroidered on the right breast of the jacket or sometimes appears in chenille across the back like a jersey. The school mascot can often be found on the sleeve, under the name in front, or in center on the back. Pins and badges, representing the owner’s various accomplishments, can be found in different spots on the jacket. Whether they’re for placing in a certain ranking, winning a district division or being awarded an honor such a ‘team captain,’ these patches are always unique to both the activity and the individual.  #EFschoolspirit                 Letterman jackets are almost always produced in the school colors, with the wool body of the jacket in the primary school color and the contrasting leather sleeves in the secondary school color. The letter patch, which is made out of a chenille fabric, usually sits on the left breast of the jacket. The letter is the first letter or the initials of the school and can be customized to fit a particular sport or activity. Region patches are a common way to wear your city and state with pride. Letterman jackets are lifelong keepsakes, so students will mark their geographical location – whether in the form of the school county, state or even an American flag – to identify the time and place that they received the jacket. The placement of the year of graduation is often sewn on the right sleeve or just above the right pocket.
