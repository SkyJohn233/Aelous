viewers were car fans writing if you 're a lover of stomach-clenching speed that turns the world into a neon blur then fast furious the fourth edition of that metal-twisting series should leave you

leaves me profoundly indifferent after three earlier movies in the series which have been transmuted into video games why do we need a fourth one oh i just answered my own question ebert noted the
