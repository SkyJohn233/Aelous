Penetration of ceftazidime into the human prostate gland following intravenous injection. Abbas AM, Taylor MC, Da Silva C, Francis RA, Bennet C. >< >< >< The concentration of ceftazidime in human prostatic tissue obtained bytransurethral resection was measured by microbiological assay in 24 patientsafter the intravenous administration of one 2 g dose. The average concentrationof ceftazidime in the tissue was 10.1 micrograms/g 70 min after injection and 6.1micrograms/g 140 min after injection; these levels were each approximately 14% ofthe corresponding serum levels. The concentration of ceftazidime achieved in the prostatic tissue was greater than the minimum inhibitory concentrations ofceftazidime for Gram-negative pathogens. ><
