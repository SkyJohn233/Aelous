xeelee vengeance by stephen baxter thebookbag.co.uk book review buy xeelee vengeance by stephen baxter at amazon.co.uk or amazon.com share on michael poole earth 's greatest living engineer changed the galaxy when he opened a worm hole to allow for quick and easy transportation across the solar system however such a thing was created with a degree of naivety and a lack of foresight because out of the worm hole flew an unknown vessel of alien origin unlike anything seen by human eyes before it is unstoppable and unfathomable bent on an unknown path the vessel is unresponsive to the human life around it it ignores hails and even direct attacks nothing affects it not even the surface of the sun all it seems to want is energy and earth has plenty of that to be absorbed however as exciting and mysterious as this early incident may sound the plot was unfortunately as slow as the giant xeelee vessel that crawled through the system it was drawn out and dragging at a terribly slow pace and despite the huge amount of build up for the final confrontation there was a surprising lack of tension created for the situation earth was under direct threat yet somehow the writing did not evoke a sense of drama it felt detached and distant even from its own protagonist stephen baxter has some grand ideas but the writing here did not deliver them in an entertaining way nor was it thought provoking or engaging on any level poole is a name associated with brilliant ideas and ingenuity this idea is relayed very early on in the book and it is constantly reinforced through dialogue that much so it became increasingly frustrating and annoying to the point of absolute redundancy it 's a classic example of the importance of showing over telling that being said none of the characters actually displayed much in the way of creativeness or the genius they were supposed to have one example the author drew upon was michael using his spacecraft to shunt the xeelee vessel certainly not an action i would call particularly intelligent the ending of the book another feat on michael 's behalf seemed lazy and very last minute for most of the story he seemed like a passive bystander completely happy to let his father take charge in the upcoming crisis he barely acted and when he did it was out of spontaneity all in all he did not live up to the puffing up of his family name the author felt compelled to do at every possible opportunity michael 's farther only a poole by marriage demonstrated more of the family qualities than michael did it 's a little odd really on a character and plot level this book did not deliver but for the right reader baxter 's exploration of technology and science may be of some interest he demonstrates an in depth knowledge of science and the speculative possibilities of where it could take us in the future he also had some interesting ideas about artificial intelligence and the sentience of it at times i felt like his writing and knowledge would be more appropriate in non-fiction theory books it certainly was leaning towards being more informative rather than narrative based at times i will not be reading the sequel this book was not for me those looking for a science fiction novel with a bit more energy and character may like the weight of the world the amaranthine spectrum by tom toner or the algebraist by iain m banks you can read more book reviews or buy xeelee vengeance by stephen baxter at amazon.co.uk you can read more book reviews or buy xeelee vengeance by stephen baxter at amazon.com like to comment on this review just send us an email and we 'll put the best up on the site website support from studio 83 and reliably hosted by 1 1
