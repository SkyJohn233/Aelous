has a brave new age in taco culture dawned to arcadia phoenix new times no connection last update has a brave new age in taco culture dawned to arcadia phoenix new times richard hinojosa makes tacos he makes chicken tacos he makes beef tacos he makes scallop octopus and lobster tacos he makes a poke taco with a taro root chip for a shell a shrimp taco sopping with green curry he makes tacos with cajun creole szechuan argentinian and brazilian flavors he even makes a korean fried chicken taco with green onion mojo and gochujang he makes al pastor tacos just and nothing like al pastor al pastor is marked by pork and pineapple both often shaved from spits in the style of shawarma al pastor has lebanese origins for his taco hinojosa confits pork belly he chars pineapple cooks the fruit down and adds it as a pur e. you got all the cool flavors of al pastor hinojosa says but it was a different interpretation what exactly is hinojosa doing at crujiente tacos in arcadia are these even tacos the taco has amorphous boundaries just like the sandwich is a hot dog a sandwich is a hamburger a taco many people would agree is a tortilla folded around filling people who have grown up eating tacos or love them especially likely have further definitions tortilla makeup and size proportion of fillings softness crunch where in the taco universe do hinojosa s new-age tacos fall and do they even fall there at all hinojosa opened crujiente tacos in november 2016 he was born in texas his family came from mexico a few generations back when he was younger he would visit relatives in mexico 's rio grande valley his mom cooked a little bit of everything but really tex-mex over the years hinojosa cooked in arizona california colorado and hawaii he cooked alongside people from japan thailand and polynesia when he makes tacos he incorporates what he has learned i let the ingredients lead in the direction of the taco he says there s no harness on them they can go kind of wherever there is something of a fringe movement in mexican cooking toward novel food mexican chef enrique olvera who helms world-class restaurants such as pujol in mexico city and cosme in new york cooks innovative mexican dishes like uni tostada and cobia al pastor alex stupak a white dude based in the northeast shapes unconventionally colored tortillas and even crafts a pastrami taco he recently won a james beard award for a book called tacos recipes and provocations hinojosa cooks in this new-age tradition for a minimalist duck taco he places two slices of breast on a blue corn tortilla he doesn t spoon salsa verde on top but widely spaces two circles of the green sauce the duck rests on red mole which is a mashup of his grandmother s and godmother s moles toasted sesame seeds peanuts and micro cilantro complete the taco this is a grilled chicken taco elevated about 12 stories so far hinojosa has featured some 80 tacos he says he does n't cook mexican food but at the same time operates a taco restaurant his tacos he says range from mexican-influenced to not mexican not mexican includes curry shrimp and korean fried chicken tacos the idea that a taco could be something other than mexican is strange and hard to digest but cuisine is n't fixed dishes evolve new ingredients come into the fold food changes for his many tacos hinojosa presses his own tortillas using heirloom blue corn masa he has made flavored tortillas by mixing corn with cilantro poblano fresno chile cardamom and dashi these nonconformist additions can change the tortilla 's color some of his food is traditional like posole ceviche and guacamole taco-wise he makes green chile pork and crunchy beef tacos in a more standard vein though not strictly traditional his lamb taco comes from a mexican memory while traveling as a kid he discovered eating goat some of his food is more progressive alien next to what you 'd find in your local taqueria he makes szechuan beef cheek tacos tacos featuring beef braised for 36 hours avocado tempura tacos that some of his tacos cost more than 5 does n't disqualify them from being tacos yes a 2 taco is a great thing but not all tacos have to be cheap upgrading a taco 's ingredients should n't make somebody a pariah it should make him or her a luminary who channels cooking 's zeitgeist if chris bianco can elevate pasta the ultimate peasant food a food that costs 2 a box with heirloom grains and badass pork then why ca n't hinojosa do the same for the taco if you pay close to 20 for a pizza or north of 25 for a pasta bowl then spending 5 on a taco should n't be too much when it comes to defining taco hinojosa keeps things open a taco in essence is a good tortilla a focused topping with accompaniments you ve got to be able to pick it up and eat it as a whole that s it that said he does have rules for taco making as does stupak you don t just throw something on a taco and call it a taco hinojosa says you have to keep the integrity of what a taco is everything on the tortilla has a place each brings something to the taco to the dish people he says are starting to open their minds about what mexican food can be he takes pride in the time and attention he spends on his tacos he loves that his approach is different elevated and when all goes right makes for a cerebral taco are hinojosa s tacos mexican food are his tacos even tacos where you draw these lines is a thorny and fascinating question given what he and other chefs are cooking how they are stretching tradition like melted candy how elusive and imprecise food definitions are and cuisine 's shifting nature and hinojosa you can bet wants to keep stretching i love that this world is opening up he says of novel approaches to mexican cuisine if people thought we were even doing a little bit to help that i would be thrilled crujiente tacos 3961 east camelback road 602-687-7777 open monday to thursday 3 to 10 p.m. friday and saturday 3 to 11 p.m. closed sunday use of
