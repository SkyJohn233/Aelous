the bugatti 100p was ahead of its time here 's why flite test already a member log-in or register now a story of ambition a lost aircraft and a project that ended sadly in tragedy the 100p tells us much about the struggle of aviation if you were to ask an average joe about bugatti they d probably think of veyrons chirons and classic grand prix cars but certainly not airplanes this is perhaps because ettore bugatti the man behind the legendary bugatti automotive and designer louis de monge only designed the one however this could have been different bugatti wanted to create a race plane to compete in the deutsch de la meurth cup in the grand prix d aviation like other contemporary championships of the era such as the schneider trophy this race saw the most powerful planes of the time go head to head in a thrilling sprint by the way if you wanted to get your hands on a schneider trophy type airplane to fly for yourself check out one of our newest rc speed build kits the ft sea angel bugatti hoped to race the plane and perhaps sell the design as a french fighter work to design the aircraft started in 1938 culminating in just one prototype that was never completed this was just one year before war burst across the continent and the project had to be halted unfortunately the 100p had come too late the company was forced to hide the only prototype along with drawings and specifications as the german army invaded france in 1940 it was stowed in a barn in the french countryside sources suggest that the germans were aware that the aircraft existed but the prototype was never found the lost fighter stayed in its hiding place for decades before it was rediscovered in 1970 it was then taken to the us for restoration so what made the design so revolutionary well everything about the project was angled to create the fastest most eye-wateringly quick airplane in the world something that would have been extremely valuable to the air force during the invasion of france it was designed to reach staggering speeds in excess of 450mph this was at a time when contemporary aircraft were struggling to reach 300mph its configuration was extremely unusual both for then and today two 8-cylinder bugatti type 50 engines were mounted behind the cockpit which drove two contra-rotating propellers up front it also attempted to make use of the recently discovered meredith effect this was the idea of creating a sort of negative-drag affect why pulling air through a radiator to create an expansion effect that cancels out the drag that would usually be induced this tech was later used on aircraft like the p-51 mustang clearly the bugatti would have been a very clever airplane it s not all that surprising therefore that a group of people one day decided to see if they could build a flying replica of the bugatti 100p triumph and tragedy every so often we re reminded of the inherent dangers of aviation risk to life has always been a part of manned flight and will likely continue to be tragically in 2016 the bugatti 100p project lost its founder and test pilot scotty wilson in a crash at clinton sherman airport oklahoma he and his team had been on a quest to create the only flying bugatti 100p in the world the project reverse engineered the found original prototype from 1938 it was reconstructed using two bugatti engines just like the original the finished aircraft was a magnificent recreation of de monge s vision the bugatti 100p project succeeded in bringing a lost design into being although the story ended in sadness this achievement will be remembered as the history of aviation continues to unfold here s to you scotty wilson find out more about the bugatti 100p the bugatti 100p project build your own foam board bugatti check out joshua orchard s stunning 100p rc model images by the bugatti 100p project article by james whomsley editor of flitetest.com contact james flitetest.com youtube channel www.youtube.com/projectairaviation you need to log-in to rate articles find this article others like it at www.flitetest.com by flitetest by joining our mailing list via the home page or during checkout you agree to receive periodic yet meaningful email contacts from us and us alone copyright 2019 flite test all rights reserved get access to additional features and goodies looking for your store account forgot your password do n't have an account create an account here
