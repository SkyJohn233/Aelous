Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers on JSTOR Submissions Journal Home Page Subscribe Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers  is a leading international journal of major research papers. It is one of the most widely read and cited geographical journals. It publishes substantial articles of the highest scholarly standard on any theoretical or empirical subject in geography. Papers based upon original research, which draw attention to the wider implications of their findings, assessment of debates at the cutting edge of the discipline and contributions showing the methodological and interdisciplinary significance of geography for critical environmental and social understanding are especially welcome. The "moving wall" represents the time period between the last issue            available in JSTOR and the most recently published issue of a journal.            Moving walls are generally represented in years. In rare instances, a            publisher has elected to have a "zero" moving wall, so their current            issues are available in JSTOR shortly after publication.             Note: In calculating the moving wall, the current year is not counted.             For example, if the current year is 2008 and a journal has a 5 year            moving wall, articles from the year 2002 are available.
