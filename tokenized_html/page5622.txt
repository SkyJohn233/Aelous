specifically controlled in either germline or somatic cells using the gal4/uas system protein trap lines provide fluorescent tags of proteins expressed at endogenous levels for live imaging and screening backgrounds this review provides information on many available reagents and key methods for research in oogenesis oogenesis in drosophila 1 2 supports an impressively high level of fecundity ovaries in adult females consist of ~16 parallel tubes called ovarioles that contain developing egg chambers arranged a linear array of progressive developmental stages fig 1 movement of egg chambers is facilitated by peristaltic contractions of circular muscles surrounding each ovariole and a muscle mesh surrounding the whole ovary 3 x02013 5 the ovarioles of each ovary converge at a lateral oviduct which connects to a common oviduct and then the uterus mature stage 14 eggs move into the uterus where they are fertilized by a single sperm and then laid the development of each egg takes about eight days roughly half of this time is spent in the germarium for egg chamber formation and the remaining four days are required for egg chamber development each of the ovarioles produces approximately two eggs per day or over 60 eggs from a young well-fed female 6 this high output of eggs depends on an abundant source of food major contributions from support cells in egg chambers and a wide range of cellular interactions an overview of oogenesis and examples of how its study has contributed to our understanding of developmental biology are summarized in this section the formation of egg chambers also called follicles takes place during the first four days of oogenesis in the germarium germline stem cells at the apical end of germaria are maintained by signaling from adjacent niche cells called cap cells stem cell daughters called cystoblasts leave the niche and undergo four mitotic divisions to produce a cyst of 16 cells incomplete cytokinesis in these divisions leaves intercellular bridges that are later stabilized by the accumulation of filamentous actin to form ring canals that persist until the end of oogenesis somatic escort cells encase the dividing cysts after completing mitosis escort cells are exchanged for follicle cells to complete stage 1 egg chamber assembly the follicle cells are generated by two follicle-cell stem cells located between germarium regions 2a and 2b thus the germarium contains two types of stem cells maintained in separate niches whose division rates must be coordinated to produce cells necessary for egg chamber production only one of the 16 germline-derived cells develops into an oocyte while the remaining 15 differentiate into nurse cells with polyploid nuclei by the time an egg chamber emerges from the germarium the oocyte is already positioned at the posterior as a result of a signaling cascade emanating from the next most mature egg chamber thus the first four days of oogenesis produce an oocyte already endowed with anterior/posterior axis information and accompanied by a suite of nurse cells and follicle cells poised to support oocyte development examination of egg chamber assembly carried out in many laboratories has yielded a huge amount of information on stem cell and stem cell niche biology 7 8 and the origins of polarity 9 this research takes advantage of powerful genetic and cytological tools developed over many years the second half of oogenesis ~3.5 days takes place in stage 2 x02013 14 egg chambers as they move within ovarioles toward the oviducts most of this time is needed for previtellogenic egg chamber development during stages 2 x02013 8 when oocyte growth is mediated entirely by intercellular movement of cytoplasm from nurse cells to the oocyte through ring canals the diameter of ring canals slowly expands as egg chambers grow mediated by active actin filament polymerization in the ring canal rim 10 the polarization of oocytes is established during these stages as a consequence of the posterior location of the oocyte nucleus the gurken mrna accumulates at the posterior with the oocyte nucleus and produces a ligand for egfr activation in posterior follicle cells 11 egfr activation transmits a signal back to the germline that causes microtubule reorganization in the anterior/posterior axis in addition many maternal mrnas and rna-binding proteins accumulate specifically in oocytes through a combination of microtubule-based directed transport and trapping within the oocyte 12 follicle cells also make crucial contributions to previtellogenic oogenesis egg chambers change shape from spherical to elongated starting during stage 5 interestingly this shape change is driven by egg chamber rotations that occur between stages 5 and 9 follicle cells drive the rotations as they migrate perpendicular to the axis of the ovariole laying down a girdle of polarized extracellular matrix as they go as a result expansion of egg chambers takes place anisotropically toward the poles 13 a major change in cell cycle also takes place in follicle cells mitotic divisions cease at the end of stage six followed by three endoreplication cycles during stages 7 x02013 10a 14 the notch-delta signaling pathway controls this transition 15 16 providing an excellent opportunity for studying cell cycle changes under developmental control like the germline cysts the follicle cells are also syncytial as they remain interconnected with a number of sibling cells by small ~200 nm diameter ring canals that result from incomplete cytokinesis 17 x02013 19 these ring canals do not grow in size during oogenesis but they are able to support intercellular movement of protein between cells raising the interesting possibility that they serve an important function in oogenesis 20 21 stage 8 egg chambers do not progress into vitellogenesis yolk uptake if egg chambers have severe patterning defects or if environmental conditions are unlikely to support the survival of progeny limiting the availability of protein in the diet of females causes egg chamber apoptosis at the end of stage 8 thus avoiding the metabolic cost of completing egg development and depleting the female x02019 s energy stores during egg chamber apoptosis follicle cells lose their epithelial organization and become phagocytic engulfing the cytoplasm of germline cells 22 23 if egg chambers are sound and protein is restored to the food oogenesis resumes and stage 14 eggs can develop from surviving stage 8 egg chambers within one day thus stage 8 serves as a metabolic checkpoint that triggers egg chamber destruction while preserving less mature egg chambers poised to resume development when conditions improve the final day of oogenesis produces a huge increase in oocyte volume due to yolk uptake from hemolymph and the complete transfer of nurse cell cytoplasm to the oocyte yolk uptake beginning at the end of stage 8 causes the rate oocyte growth to overtake nurse cell growth so that the oocyte takes up half the volume of egg chambers by stage 10a during these stages several key patterning molecules are localized within the oocyte oskar mrna at the posterior bicoid mrna at the anterior and gurken mrna at the dorsal anterior domain 24 the movement and anchoring of these maternal mrnas are active areas of research that benefit from the ability to do live-cell imaging to reveal conserved mechanisms of mrna localization 25 26 the final phase of oocyte growth happens during stage 11 when nurse cells contract and squeeze or x02018 dump x02019 their remaining cytoplasm into the oocyte in about 30 minutes accompanied by robust microtubule-mediated mixing of the oocyte cytoplasm nurse cell death after dumping has some of the hallmarks of apoptosis although it is a caspase-independent process 23 27 in preparation for this nurse cell dumping stage 10b egg chambers produce cables of unipolar actin filaments that grow from the nurse cell membranes inward until they reach the nuclear envelope 28 29 the actin cables prevent nurse cell nuclei from being squeezed into ring canals where they would block the flow of cytoplasm to the oocyte prostaglandin signaling is involved with triggering the formation of nurse cell actin cables 30 follicle cells form a secretory epithelium in egg chambers with apical/basal polarity and extensive microvilli on their apical surfaces facing the germline cells they secrete yolk protein during vitellogenesis vitelline membrane proteins during stage 9 x02013 11 and finally chorion proteins beginning in stage 11 in preparation for chorion protein production stage 9 follicle cells switch from endoreplication to synchronous amplification of the two chorion-gene clusters through repeated firings of replication origins in the clusters 31 32 the endocycle to amplification switch is mediated by down-regulation of notch and activation of the ecdysone receptor 33 in addition to driving egg chamber rotation follicle cell migrations dramatically change egg chamber organization during stage 9 6 x02013 10 border cells delaminate from the anterior follicle cell epithelium and migrate between nurse cells to the anterior of the oocyte carrying two polar cells as passengers the migration of these cells is guided by the pvr growth factor produced in the oocyte 34 and propelled by acto-myosin dynamics 35 as border cell migrate between nurse cells other follicle cells move around nurse cells toward the oocyte where they form a columnar epithelium during stage 10a follicle cells at the anterior circumference of the oocyte migrate centripetally separating the oocyte from nurse cells nurse cell dumping is completed just as centripetal follicle cells completely cover the oocyte anterior at the end of stage 11 the border cells participate in forming the micropyle through which a sperm reaches the oocyte two groups of 65 x02013 80 follicle cells in the anterior dorsal domain form specialized eggshell structures called dorsal appendages that facilitate gas exchange during embryogenesis the specification and morphogenesis of dorsal appendages are mediated by patterning cues in specific follicle cell groups 36 extensive gal4/uas tools are available for manipulating gene expression in germline and somatic cells of egg chambers however using the right uas vector is critical the original uast vectors include p element ends for transformation and work very well in the somatic cells of the ovary however uast-mediated expression is extremely poor in germline cells pernille r x000f8 rth 37 determined that the basal promoter from the hsp70 gene used in uast is not expressed in germline cells she produced new uasp vectors that instead use the basal promoter from the p element transposase gene uasp vectors are included in the t. murphy collection of gateway vectors at the bloomington dgrc a version of uasp that includes the attb sequence for phic31-mediated integration was reported recently 38 the uast vector is available at the dgrc in bloomington and versions of uast with the attb recombination sequence are available at flyc31 new uas attb vectors made in the rubin lab at janelia farm are optimized for expression in the nervous system 39 however they work very well in follicle cells and also support expression in germline cells rubin lab vectors are listed on their website and are available at addgene a multitude of gal4 lines is available from stock centers and labs that are useful for driving expression in specific cells of the ovary the best source for comprehensive general information is the gal4 page of the bloomington drosophila stock center bdsc although this page has limited information on expression many of these lines are derived from gal4 enhancer trap screens aimed at identifying lines expressed in during oogenesis and early embryogenesis 40 41 commonly used drivers for oogenesis research are listed in table 1 including lines for expression in the stem cell niche germarium germline cells and follicle cells gal4 expression from the nanos promoter is in germline stem cells then recedes in young egg chambers and resumes later in oogenesis the otu promoter produces more uniform expression in the germarium and egg chambers but tapers off toward the end of oogenesis a line called maternal triple driver mtd -gal4 has three gal4 constructs p otu-gal4 :vp16.r 1 w* p gal4-nos.ngt 40 p gal4 :vp16-nos.utr mvd1 providing robust germline expression throughout oogenesis 42 for germline expression outside the germarium starting in stage 2 the mat x003b1 -tubgal4 mat line is ideal most of the lines driving expression in somatic follicle cells are also expressed in other tissues of the fly an exception is vm26a-gal4 which has the promoter from the vitelline membrane 26aa gene and is specific for follicle cells in stage 10 x02013 14 egg chambers 36 a curious aspect of gal4/uas expression in egg chambers is frequent mosaicism a group of follicle cells with one level of reporter expression is often adjacent to another group with a very different level nurse cells can also display different levels of expression 43 the explanation for follicle cell mosaicism may involve epigenetic marks inherited by progeny during mitotic proliferation 44 though the level of variation in expression is somewhat masked by intercellular movement of proteins between follicle cells through ring canals 20 the probability of mosaic expression levels should be taken into consideration when interpreting results of an experiment involving gal4-mediated expression a method to impose an additional layer of temporal control on gal4 driven gene expression is the target system 45 target relies on ubiquitous expression of gal80ts a specific temperature sensitive repressor of gal4 to inhibit gal4 driven transgene expression at 18 x000b0 c the permissive temperature for gal80ts the gal80ts-mediated repression is relieved by shifting flies to the restrictive temperature for gal80ts ~29 x000b0 c which allows gal4 to activate transcription this method can works follicle cells 46 but in our experience gal80ts is not able to repress strong gal4 expression from mat x003b1 -tubgal4 in the germline repression of weaker germline gal4 drivers may be possible however but this needs further testing for rescue experiments or screening backgrounds it can be desirable to have gene expression under the control of a promoter directly fused to a cdna rather than using the bipartite gal4/uas system several vectors are available with promoters for germline-specific expression or for ubiquitous expression in egg chambers table 2 vectors using the promoter from the x003b1 -tubulin at 67c x003b1 tub67c gene direct strong uniform expression in germline cells beginning in stage 2 egg chambers the ovarian tumor otu promoter produces low to moderate levels of germline expression throughout oogenesis and the hsp26 promoter produces moderate levels of expression starting in stage 8 egg chambers the nanos nos or vasa vas promoter directs expression in primordial germ cells in developing animals and in the germline cells of the adult germarium expression is low in early egg chambers and high in late stages for ubiquitous expression the ubiquitin-63e ubi-p63e or spaghetti-squash promoter is a good choice the x003b1 -tubulin at 84b x003b1 tub84b promoter also provides expression in both germline and follicle cells although expression is lower in the germline the greatest strength of drosophila as an experimental system is the ability to use genetic analysis to understand cellular and developmental processes work from many labs during the past decades has resulted in remarkable innovations in the genetic tools available to study the genes and developmental mechanisms controlling oogenesis we present here the basis for classical genetic approaches and also summarize more recently developed techniques that rely on transgenic manipulations initial genetic approaches to study oogenesis focused on screens for recessive loss-of-function mutations affecting female fertility the two broad classes of mutations affecting female fertility are female-sterile fs mutations and maternal-effect lethal mutations mel by definition female-sterile mutations cause a defect during oogenesis such that normal eggs are not produced in contrast females bearing maternal-effect lethal mutations are able to produce normal eggs indicating that oogenesis is able to proceed normally but these eggs fail to produce viable offspring due to the lack of a gene product essential for embryonic development that is normally provided to the egg during oogenesis maternal-effect lethal mutations have been invaluable in understanding the mechanisms of early embryonic development screening for recessive female-sterile and/or maternal-effect lethal mutations requires an f 3 screen where mutagenized chromosomes are balanced made homozygous and tested for effects on fertility this task therefore requires substantial effort and several large-scale of this type were conducted in 1970s and 1980s as a result of these efforts most genes that can be mutated to specifically affect female fertility have likely been identified 47 x02013 53 while female-sterile screens succeeded in isolating many genes that are critical for female fertility the majority of genes that function in oogenesis are essential genes for which loss of function mutations do not produce a female-sterile phenotype the study of these genes requires a means to inactivate or knock down gene function specifically in the ovary without compromising essential functions elsewhere in the fly historically three experimental approaches have been developed to engineer genetically mosaic ovaries pole cell transplantation mitotic recombination and tissue-specific rnai the latter two approaches are far easier to carry out and are more commonly used but transplantation experiments can be useful in certain circumstances primordial germ cells form early in embryonic development and are the first embryonic cells to undergo cellularization this allows them to be unambiguously identified in the embryo and they can be transplanted from one embryo to another using micromanipulation if the recipient embryo is derived from a strain lacking a functional germline usually by carrying the dominant female-sterile gene ovo d1 then the resulting germline will be formed from the transplanted germ cells transplanted pole cells give rise to only germline tissue 54 55 so this technique can be used to determine whether a gene affecting oogenesis functions in the germ cells or the associated somatic cells experiments using such approaches led to important conclusions regarding sex determination and intercellular communication in drosophila a recent publication 56 describes an updated protocol on the technique that was originally developed in the 1970s 57 58 a versatile and widely used system to generate genetic mosaics in oogenesis is mitotic recombination in this system flies heterozygous for a mutation of interest are induced to undergo recombination during the g2 phase of the cell cycle so that inter-homolog exchange distal to a centromere will give rise to genetically distinct daughter cells the wild-type chromosome typically includes a marker or reporter gene to allow for identification of recombined cells figure 2 when mitotic recombination was first used to generate genetic mosaics recombination was induced by exposing flies to ionizing radiation 59 this method is relatively inefficient however and the introduction of the yeast flp/frt site-specific recombination system into flies vastly improved the efficiency of genetic mosaic analysis 60 in this system the yeast flp enzyme acts on two f lp r ecombination t argets frts and catalyzes dna strand exchange transgenes carrying frt sequences have been recovered in centrosome-proximal positions on all five chromosome arms enabling efficient mitotic recombination schemes to generate homozygous mutant clones for essentially all drosophila genes 61 62 identifying mutant germline mosaics can be done genetically using dominant female sterile dfs method or visually using reporters the most efficient method to identify germline clones for later-staged egg chambers is the flp-dfs technique 63 x02013 65 this method uses a genetic selection to specifically mark germline mosaics resulting from mitotic recombination the selection relies on the dominant female-sterile mutation ovo d1 which when heterozygous results in an early arrest of germline development in flp-dfs the experiment is designed so that ovo d1 and the mutation are on frt-bearing chromosomes that are trans-heterozygous with each other when recombination is induced in germ line stem cells or their progenitors germ cells will be generated that are homozygous for the mutation of interest and importantly lack the ovo d1 mutation the only egg chambers that survive to later stages are the non- ovo d1 egg chambers that are homozygous for the mutation of interest screens using elegant versions of this approach identified several genes involved in oocyte specification and development in 66 x02013 68 while the flp-dfs system is an efficient means of generating late-stage germline clones it is not useful for identifying germline clones during early oogenesis or for identifying clones in somatic cells instead mosaics in these cell types can be identified using a variety of cytological markers the simplest and most commonly used marking system for genetic mosaic analysis is negative marking where mutant cells are marked by loss of a marker among these markers nuclear-localized gfp expressed from the ubiquitin promoter is most commonly used but other markers including ubiquitously expressed x003b2 -galactosidase and the myc epitope fused to either nuclear or membrane localization domains can also be useful when gfp fluorescence is not desirable 62 chromosomes with these markers recombined onto the commonly used frts are available at the bloomington stock center it is important to note that the syncytial nature of ovarian cells can have important consequences for negative marking strategies as mentioned in section 1.1 follicle cells remain interconnected in syncytial nests of varying size and small proteins can readily diffuse between connected follicle cells 20 thus it is probable that in when homozygous mutant cells are marked by loss of gfp some gfp may diffuse from wild-type gfp producing cells to the neighboring mutant cells that lack the gfp transgene similarly wild-type gene product may or may not depending on its ability to diffuse move from a genetically wild-type cell to a homozygous mutant cell the extent to which this is a concern in clonal analysis of follicle cells depends on the ability of the marker and the wild-type gene product to diffuse for a more complete discussion of these issues see 21 in addition to negative marking the marcm system mosaic analysis with a repressible clonal marker allows mutant cells to be positively marked by a uas reporter transgene 69 in marcm mitotic recombination is induced in a background where both gal4 and its repressor gal80 are ubiquitously expressed reporter gene expression is repressed by gal80 which is expressed from a transgene that is heterozygous with the mutant of interest mitotic recombination results in progeny cells that are homozygous for the mutant and lack the gal80 transgene only these cells will express the uas reporter while this system is more complicated to set up many stocks are available at bloomington to facilitate marcm crossing schemes marcm stocks a further advantage of marcm is that other uas transgenes in addition to visible markers can be incorporated into marcm experiments this has been done in ovarian follicle cells for example where mutant clones of a vacuolar atpase were tested for their ability to suppress the effects of uas-driven constructs that expressed activated forms of the notch signaling protein 70 in addition it is possible to use biologically informative reporters as clonal markers for example a probe such as uas-gfp :tubulin can be used as both a clonal marker and as a label for the microtubule cytoskeleton mitotic recombination can also be used to trace cell lineage in a tissue as the cells divide lineage tracing experiments have been used to understand how somatic and germline stem cells contribute to ovarian tissue homeostasis e.g. 71 72 several techniques based on flp/frt recombination have been developed that allow distinct labeling of mitotic lineages in oogenesis the x0201c x-15 x0201d lineage tracing system relies on mitotic recombination between frt sequences to fuse the strong ubiquitous x003b1 -tub84b promoter with the e. coli lacz gene 73 when recombination is induced during mitosis one lineage inherits the promoter- lacz fusion and will express high levels of x003b2 -galactosidase which can be easily detected using either an x-gal staining reaction or immunofluorescence two additional lineage tracing systems the twin spot generator tsg 74 and twin spot marcm 75 have been recently developed in which both cell lineages resulting from mitotic recombination are labeled the twin spot generator is similar to the x-15 system in concept but in this case frt recombination reconstitutes ubiquitously driven rfp and gfp transgenes in the two lineages twin spot marcm functions similarly to conventional marcm except that instead of gal80-mediated repression gfp and rfp are repressed by synthetic micrornas in un-recombined cells it is also possible to use the twin spot marking systems to compare wild type and mutant lineages but only if a gene of interest is located distal to the frt and transgene sites currently the twin spot marcm transgenes are set up on chromosome arm 2l while twin-spot generator transgenes are available at centromere-proximal locations on chromosome arms 2l 3l and 3r 74 rnai in drosophila has become an immensely powerful tool and at least three genomic-scale projects have been undertaken with the goal of establishing transgenic rnai lines for essentially all drosophila genes 76 77 and rnai fly unpublished available lines are listed at the following sites vdrc trip and rnai fly for many cell types in drosophila rnai is efficiently induced by expressing an inverted-repeat x0201c hairpin x0201d rna 78 the vienna and rnai fly transgenic rnai collection consists of transgenes that express hairpin rnas 76 under uas control however hairpin rnas do not effectively silence genes in the female germline limiting their usefulness in studying oogenesis more recently a novel transgenic rnai system has been developed that allows potent gene silencing in all cell types including ovarian germ cells 79 this method was designed to express short rna hairpins in a microrna backbone these rnas appear to be more efficient in gene knockdown 80 experimental tests of this system demonstrated that the short micro-rnas shrnas produced a potent knockdown of target genes in all cell types examined including ovarian germ cells 79 a new large-scale transgenic rnai collection is being generated using the shrna strategy and these lines are also available at trip effective rnai silencing in the germline enabled a large-scale screen for genes involved in ovarian stem cell regulation 81 by testing rnai lines driven by either mtd-gal4 which drives uas-rnai expression beginning in stem cells and their progenitors or mat x003b1 -tubgal4 which begins driving expression after germline cyst formation is complete it was possible to identify genes that function in the germarium outside the germarium or both the cells that make up the ovary are remarkable from a cell biological perspective both somatic and germline cells are unusually large with the germ line nurse cells up to 100 x003bc in diameter and the somatic follicle cells up to nearly 30 x003bc in height the cells of the ovary therefore represent a unique opportunity to study a variety of cell biological processes preparing fixed ovaries for direct imaging or immunofluorescence is straightforward and standard formaldehyde fixation/immunofluorescence protocols give excellent results for many purposes however some special considerations and protocol variations are needed for preservation of certain cellular structures and antigens we discuss these below a further advantage of studying cell biology in the drosophila ovary is the large number of proteins and cellular compartments can be labeled using publicly available reagents several large-scale screens for proteins traps have resulted in hundreds of genes being tagged with an artificial gfp exon 82 x02013 84 a subset of protein traps with localization patterns that are useful in oogenesis are listed in table 3 in addition transgenes have been engineered that express fluorescent protein fusions allowing the localization of many proteins and structures in oogenesis some of these are listed in table 4 and more can be found at the bloomington drosophila stock center programed cell death plays several important roles in drosophila oogenesis 23 and a wealth of reagents and methods to study apoptosis necrosis and autophagy have been developed 85 86 finally the developmental studies hybridoma bank dshb at the university of iowa is an excellent resource for monoclonal antibodies that recognize 215 drosophila proteins these antibodies are available to academic research labs for a nominal fee the actual removal and dissection of ovaries is not difficult and with practice the task is accomplished easily as most of the tissue within the abdomen of a well-fed female is ovary ovary dissection has been described in detail in several methods papers 87 x02013 89 and there was also an excellent video of ovary dissection in preparation for fixation accompanying zimmerman et al 89 ovaries can be dissected into pbs or more specialized media designed for drosophila ex vivo culture e.g. ebr 87 imads 90 or grace x02019 s or schneider x02019 s drosophila media 88 91 once the ovaries are removed dissecting forceps are typically used to tease apart the ovary into individual ovarioles note that one method for dissociating ovaries that relies on rapid pipetting of the tissue can damage the cells and lead to phenotypic artifacts 92 so this method should be avoided in most instances preservation of many ovarian antigens and cellular structures can be accomplished with a short 5 x02013 20 minute fixation using buffered 4 x02013 6 formaldehyde 87 93 some investigators prefer a fixation solution made from freshly dissolved paraformaldehyde though many structures are well preserved using formaldehyde diluted from a commercial reagent-grade 37 stock reagent grade formaldehyde contains ~10 methanol which may interfere with preservation of some antigens so a good alternative is commercial methanol-free electron microscopy grade formaldehyde sold by electron microscopy vendors e.g. polysciences electron microscopy sciences mature stage 14 oocytes/eggs are encased in a hydrophobic vitelline membrane and protocols for embryo fixation often include heptane in the fixative inclusion of heptane in ovary fixatives can aid in the permeabilization of late-stage oocytes but is not necessary if the focus of an experiment is to examine pre-stage 14 egg chambers an occasional problem with formaldehyde fixed tissue is poor penetration of antibodies into the germline this results in no apparent antibody labeling in the center of mid- to late-stage egg chambers leaving only a peripheral fluorescent signal strategies to alleviate this problem include altering the duration of fixation as well as inclusion of detergent or dmso during or after fixation to aid in permeabilization 93 94 in addition to formaldehyde-based fixatives other alternative fixations can be used to preserve antigens or cellular structures that are not detectable using aldehyde fixation fixation in 100 methanol results in protein denaturation and some antigens are only detectable using such a method e.g. filamin protein on fusomes 95 fixation with methanol has several drawbacks however as it prevents f-actin labeling with phalloidin and in many cases methanol reduces or eliminates signal from fluorescent proteins finally a heat fixation protocol first developed for drosophila embryos 96 can be employed and has been used as a fixative for adherens junction components in ovaries 97 preservation and efficient immunolabeling of the microtubule cytoskeleton can be challenging one important consideration is the fixation method efficient labeling of microtubules in the germ cells requires care not to over fix the tissue which prevents efficient antibody penetration a protocol that gives excellent results involves briefly fixing ovaries soon after dissection in a high 36 concentration of reagent grade formaldehyde in an effort to fix the dynamic microtubules as quickly as possible without over-fixing followed by a detergent permeabilization step 94 alternative protocols for microtubule preservation rely on methanol fixation including a recently developed protocol that includes a detergent extraction step prior to methanol fixation in an effort to allow for better penetration of antibodies 98 in addition better germline labeling of microtubules can be achieved by using an anti-tubulin antibody that is directly conjugated to a fluor many labs use dm1a an anti- x003b1 -tubulin monoclonal antibody that can be purchased as a fluorescent conjugate e.g. fitc-dm1a sigma f2168 alternatively microtubules can be visualized using a transgene that expresses a fluorescent protein fused to either tubulin or a microtubule binding protein table 4 visualizing the f-actin distribution in fixed ovaries is best accomplished using fluorescently labeled phalloidin following fixation with formaldehyde 87 phalloidin is a small peptide that binds specifically to f-actin and is a remarkably specific probe 99 inclusion of detergent and phalloidin during the fixation step has been reported to give improved results 100 while much of the f-actin cytoskeleton appears to be faithfully preserved by these protocols a recent report demonstrated that formaldehyde fixation introduces a striking artifact in the long ~50 x003bc f-actin bundles that restrain the nurse cell nuclei during dumping 29 in formaldehyde fixed tissue these bundles have a striated appearance but the striations are not observed in live tissue when the bundles are labeled with fluorescent protein fusions 29 it therefore appears that formaldehyde fixation can result in the alteration of some f-actin structures though based on our experience this artifact appears to be limited to the long f-actin cables that form at stage 10b if fixation artifacts are suspected the organization of f-actin in fixed cells can be compared to the distribution of fluorescent protein fusions that label the f-actin cytoskeleton table 4 in live cells as done in huelsmann et al 29 the ability to conduct live-cell imaging experiments has had a significant impact on cell biological studies of drosophila oogenesis short term ~30 min imaging of dissected egg chambers and ovarioles is easily accomplished by dissecting ovaries into an inert gas-permeable halocarbon oil and it is possible to introduce fluorescent tracers and/or experimental treatments into oocytes nurse cells or follicle cells using microinjection several excellent methods papers describe these procedures in detail and two have excellent accompanying video tutorials 101 x02013 103 remarkable progress has been made during the past few years in long-term up to ~24 hours imaging of live ovarian tissue recent advances in our understanding of cell division patterns 104 morphogenetic movements 13 and cell migration 35 have all benefited from long-term live-cell imaging of oogenesis much of this work was made possible because of improved ex vivo culture procedures that allow drosophila egg chambers to remain viable for up to 24 hours in culture 88 prasad et al 2007 present a thorough protocol for live imaging of egg chambers and morris et al 104 discuss special considerations for imaging germaria important considerations for long-term imaging involve culturing egg chambers in carefully prepared schneider x02019 s media that is supplemented with bovine insulin localization of rna during oogenesis is essential for patterning the egg chamber and for storing patterning cues for embryogenesis in fixed ovaries rna localization and abundance can be assessed using colorimetric rna in situ hybridization 105 more recently fluorescent in situ hybridization fish techniques have been optimized for use in drosophila that allow greater sensitivity and precision in localization 106 in addition a detailed procedure for simultaneous fish and immunofluorescence in ovaries was published 89 finally methods have also been described to localize both rna and protein by electron microscopy ish-iem 107 many mechanistic insights into rna localization required the ability to observe the process in vivo two basic strategies have been developed to observe rna localization in live ovaries microinjection of fluorescently labeled rna and the use of genetically encoded fluorescent protein fusions that bind to rna sequences in engineered constructs these approaches are discussed in detail in reviews from the davis and gavis labs 25 26 and procedures for microinjecting dissected egg chambers are included in parton et al 108 the use of a fluorescent protein fusion relies on the fusing the bacteriophage ms2 protein to a fluorescent protein and incorporating rna sequence that specifically binds ms2 into the 3 x02032 utr of the mrna under study this has been done for five developmentally important rnas table fp reagents and the st johnston lab has published detailed guidelines for designing and using the ms2 system to localize rna in oogenesis 109 conventional light and fluorescence microscopy techniques are invaluable tools in the study of drosophila oogenesis however because of the thickness of egg chambers widefield fluorescence microscopy images of ovarioles and egg chambers often exhibit substantial blurring caused by autofocus light originating from above and beneath the focal plane therefore some method of optical section microscopy is highly recommended essentially all major forms of optical sectioning microscopy including laser scanning confocal microscopy conventional and multi-photon spinning disc confocal microscopy structured illumination and deconvolution of widefield images are useful in reducing blur caused by out of focus light in optical sections the davis lab has published a brief but useful guide on choosing imaging systems that are well suited for drosophila oogenesis 110 in addition to these well-established techniques newer imaging techniques are emerging that offer new opportunities for imaging oogenesis among them are a host of super-resolution techniques that rely on photophysics and computation to localize individual fluorescent molecules with greater precision that is possible with conventional light microscopy 111 applying these techniques to the relatively thick ovarian tissue presents significant challenges but imaging is possible 112 and should improve in addition lightsheet or selective plane illumination microscopy spim promises to offer an additional useful method for imaging oogenesis lightsheet microscopy achieves optical sectioning by separate objective lenses for illumination and detection and these microscopes are able to achieve extremely rapid optical sectioning rates 113 sample preparation for lightsheet microscopy often involves embedding the tissue in a gel x02013 e.g. low-melt agarose x02013 and this appears to be compatible with live ovarian tissue the analysis specific cell populations isolated from ovaries is greatly aided by the ability to dissociate ovarian cells and perform fluorescence-activated cell sorting facs facs has been used to understand dna replication and endoreplication through nuclear flow sorting 14 and to select specific populations of gfp expressing cells for gene expression analysis 114 115 dissected ovaries can be dissociated with the aid of collagenase and/or trypsin and thorough protocols for nuclear flow sorting for dna content analysis 116 and intact cell facs analysis 117 have been published during the past several years some of the most significant advances in our understanding of drosophila ovarian biology have resulted from improved methods of live-cell imaging 13 20 104 we anticipate that further improvements in live cell imaging methods combined with new genetic analysis tools will lead to many additional insights into the molecular mechanisms of

drosophila females have a pair of ovaries top right each of which consists of ~15 ovaioles oogenesis begins in the germarium center box where germline and somatic stem cells gsc and fsc respectively divide continuously to support the formation of new egg chambers see text for further details mitotic recombination induced during g2 by expressing the flp enzyme in heterozygous cells homologous chromosomes have aligned frt sequences located near centromeres black dots subsequent segregation of chromosomes results in two genetically distinct lineages this scheme shows depicts a negative marking strategy where mutant cells are marked by loss of a ubiquitous reporter gene commonly used gal4 lines promoters useful for driving gene expression in oogenesis protein traps useful for
