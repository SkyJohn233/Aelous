game came from a real-life black cat named momo that belongs to doodler juliana chen it seemed like a good opportunity for a cat hero since the winner of last year s candy cup doodle was yellow witch and her black cat \r\n \r\n momo the muse the original concept for the game involved a magic cat making a soup that was so good it raised the dead connecting soup to halloween proved too abstract so the team shifted to the idea of a wizard school this opened the door to a more robust world filled with interesting characters and paw-some themes \r\n graveyard concepts included vacuums candy-eating ghosts and hiss-worthy exams \r\nthe game includes five levels set in a school environment the library cafeteria classroom gym and the building s rooftop we had lots of fun ideas for the resident foe of each level including a chef ghost a venn diagram ghost and a big whistle ghost that summons other spirits \r\n \r\nearly mock-up of gameplay \r\ndoodling for a whole doodle game was very exciting for us we had so many ideas for elaborate symbols to draw like a witch s hat that would appear on the character s head after it was drawn in the end we decided that for a short game against the clock simple was better plans like the eiffel tower spell were abandoned and similarly gag spells didn t make the cut regardless we loved the process of dreaming up the possibilities \r\ncat hat spell in a previous concept \r\nthat s all for meow we hope that every human creature and ghost has a purrfectly magical day \r\n meow-loween team \r\n\t\t\t art olivia huynh juliana chen kevin laughlin leon

of course just on the calendar these ten days were declared non-existent by then-pope gregory xiii as part of a realignment of the julian calendar implemented by julius caesar in 46 b.c in the mid-1570s it was discovered that the julian calendar was actually 10 days behind the seasons of the year for example easter began falling later in the spring than it should have and eventually would have drifted into summer the calendar creep was the result of the solar year the time it takes earth to make one revolution around the sun being around 11 minutes shy of the full julian calendar to be precise the solar year is actually 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes and 46 seconds pope gregory saved the day and season by appointing a commission to solve the problem it took five years but eventually the group led by physician aloysius lilius and astronomer christopher clavius proposed eliminating three leap years every 400 years to keep the calendar on track to transition to the gregorian calendar ten days were declared officially non-existent with the day after october 4 1582 declared october 15th first implemented by italy spain and portugal the gregorian calendar is today s most
