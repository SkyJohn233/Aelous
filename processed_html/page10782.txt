NEW CAT 311F RR EXCAVATOR | Canadian Underground Infrastructure Contractors looking for a machine with power to do many jobs and lower operating costs to match their business will find it with the new Cat 311F RR excavator. Powered with a 70 net horsepower (52 kW) C3.4B engine that meets U.S. EPA Tier 4 Final emissions standards, the new machine features a reduced radius that limits over-the-side tail swing to just 20 inches (508 mm), making it ideal for space-restricted job sites. A massive 5,400-pound (2,450 kg) counterweight gives it the stability and working capacity of conventional machines, while design efficiency allows for use of a full-sized cab. The machine’s compact size is complemented with fuel-saving features and an efficient hydraulic system that powers through tough digging and easily handles a range of work tools. Emissions control is transparent to the 311F RR operator, requiring no intervention and causing no interruption of work cycles. An engine idle shutdown feature automatically stops the engine after a pre-set period of idling, and an ECO mode allows adjusting machine performance to the task at hand.       100 North East Adams Street        Peoria, IL        US, 61629     Website:       cat.com               Baum Publications Ltd.           124-2323 Boundary Rd,           Vancouver, BC V5M 4V8           Canada                   604-291-9900           Toll Free: 1-888-286-3630           Fax: 604-291-1906         Insight delivered weekly to your inbox     © 2019 -             Baum Publications Ltd.           - All rights reserved. -           Privacy Statement         - Powered by           AX2 Inc     .
