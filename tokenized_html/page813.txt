k-pop reviews â€” suran wine ft. changmo prod suga review absolutely love suran s voice and suga s producing so i have been ecstatic ever since i heard this track was going to be released now the fateful day has finally arrived let s see how i feel about suran s latest track wine ft. changmo the beat starts off amazing with the high synth sounds in the beginning suran sounds so good as expected the chorus it is amazing that loud but not harsh beat is so suga s style you can tell this song is his baby i am pretty unfamiliar with changmo s work but i really liked the beginning of his verse specifically from 1:35 to around 1:48 the simple funky instrumentals at changmo s rap part works so well with his vocal tone totally diggin it ever since i listened to so far away by agust d ft. suran i ve been obsessed with suran s voice it s so clean and refreshing really nice to listen to when you re chillin anyway i am in love with this song all around great vocals+great rap+great producing=it s been on repeat all day rating ikon love scenario red velvet bad boy j-hope daydream mamamoo starry night heize jenga ft. gaeko got7 one and only you ft. hyolyn bigbang flower road nct u baby don t stop pentagon shine winner everyday eric nam honestly i am seriously blown away by bts latest full album every single track showcases amazing vocals/rap and thought-provoking lyrics here are some of my thoughts after having ly tear on repeat literally all day intro singularity taehyung the sexuality oozes from this song and sets the perfect tone for the rest of the album the whole sound is so deep and rich and i expected nothing less from the king also have you seen the choreo for this one that arm move is absolutely crazy fake love love you so bad love you so bad mold a pretty lie for you literally my favorite line both melodically and lyrically also jimin singing woo i dunno i dunno i dunno why is so enchanting i love the syncopation in this song is really ear-catching too and loving the triplet action from rap line i could go on and on about this one it s so good ugh their minds the musical geniuses the truth untold ft. steve aoki wow was not expecting this ballad from a steve aoki collab but what the hell it sounds so good when taehyung sings i am afraid i am run-down i m so afraid his tone is so impactful love the minimal acoustics in that part and then having the heavy instrumentals come in as jin sings his impactful lines wow that is really all i can say i m speechless 134340 this song is totally different from bangtan s usually sound in that it has a very mellow ambience the song was good but not stand-out in my eyes until we got near the end ugh that breakdown at hoseok s rap go off the muted instrumentals set the perfect backdrop for the king spitting absolute fire saved me paradise the irregular beat is everything jimin s verse in the beginning though after jungkook s soft voice jimin s sensuality came out of nowhere and literally attacked me actually his tone throughout this whole song hit me so hard also yoongi s rap is literally gold and how it transitions so smoothly to hoseok s verse is flawless what a bop love maze jungkook s part in the beginning is so good melodically his voice completely caught my attention right away then namjoon s legendary let them be them let us be us came through wow his diction sounds so clear in this album and it makes me so excited magic shop firstly jin sounds so good his voice is so airy and fragile and beautiful and fits the vibes of this song so well it especially contrasts well with namjoon s hard hitting rap right before his verse hoseok singing like a rose flower like a cherry tree like a morning glory like a beautiful moment was a beautiful moment i love listening to him sing honestly and the beat breakdown at that point is especially memorable also yoongi s inflection when he rapped but then looking back in fact i do not think i wanted to be the best is so amazing i need more of that voice from him by the way the producing for this track is gold in love with this sound especially the chorus airplane pt.2 what are these vibes i m getting from this track expected nothing less from international superstars i could totally get down to this dirty beat really like when jin sings we still before every line when namjoon raps near the beginning of the song it s a little detail but it adds so much texture to that verse also loving that little hope world cameo from hoseok fav anpanman kill me taehyung with your waiting for you anpanman it sounds so good his voice is everything on another note my aesthetic is when ot7 sings spin and spin my anpan keep ballin ballin still bangtan oh yeah they re still the bangtan we ve always known and loved so what what a summer party anthem it s a bop all around but my favorite part has to be namjoon s verse when he raps i don t wan na die right now i don t wan na i don t wan na fight right now his voice it sounds so clear and amazing that it totally caught my attention right away outro tear ummm this goes so hard i did not expect but i am blessed namjoon s solo you re my tear part is so good then hoseok s verse that comes right after is so hard hitting his angst comes thru also that doubling in yoongi s verse when he wraps this is real you and this is real me i ve now seen the end and even my resentment doesn t remain and there s this autotuned voice in the background it s frickin everything so many layers and so many different textures i m in love so this album is the bop of the century i would say try to change my mind but i already know no one will be able to rating shine i absolutely love that part between e dawn and hui when they sing i am a loser who loves you and yeah i am a fool fool etc the two vocal textures are so different and i love the contrast it s so catchy this whole song is so catchy it s seriously so under-appreciated shine has every potential to go viral in korea and i m honestly surprised that it hasn t yet come on korean gp open your ears~ so excited to see where they go from here i hear they re already hard at work for their next comeback so i ll be on the lookout for that rating i have been holding off on listening to the boys solo endeavors so that i can listen to them all at once and get the full btob experience i bet it s going to be amazing blend of genres so i can t wait to get started **warning super long and in-depth** rating at the end changsub what a lovely amazing ballad track i really like the rock feel that cropped up at 1:11 the added instrumentals were definitely unexpected but it was super natural in that it broke up the sound nicely and of course changsub sounds stunning i do wish that when he composed the song he made his vocals louder and the instrumentals more subdued i feel like the electric guitar and drums swallowed his amazing voice especially throughout the last half of the song and it s such a shame those high notes deserve to shine fancy shoes ilhoon i really like ilhoon s rapping style when i just listen leisurely it s sounds rather calm and relaxing but if i pay attention he s actually rapping so quickly that s pretty cool got ta say i m not the biggest fan of the chorus it s not bad it just sounds like something i ve heard before however as you can probably guess i love his rap verses especially that first verse his diction and composed tone drew me right in that girl peniel it s my boy the synth-y instrumentals sound so good and that bass line though it s the perfect accompaniment to peniel s amazing distinct tone i love the that girl oo la la la part even if it is pretty repetitive it s just so catchy i only wish the song was longer it s not even three minutes long i feel like he could have done a bit more with the verses especially in the build up to the choruses i don t know can you blame a girl for wanting to listen to peniel s voice a little longer swimming hyunsik goddamn hyunsik s vocals get me every time it s so soothing but raw and emotional and those high notes at the climax with the electric guitar wow however i do feel like the ending was a little lack-luster in my opinion i feel like something was missing it s like there s no closure to this beautiful song nevertheless i don t think it really takes too much away from the overall track it s just so beautiful i know i used the word beautiful like 10 times already but there really is no other word to describe swimming it s just art at its finest beautiful purple rain minhyuk ft. cheeze i absolutely love songs with a male and female vocal so this track caught my interest right away i really appreciate the simple string instrumentals because it accentuates the vocals so well they both sound so creamy like butter and when minhyuk s smooth singing voice comes in it knocks me away every time even though i m expecting it and i can t not talk about the climax where he raps with such raw emotion however afterwards i do feel like the transition from minhyuk to cheeze from powerful to soft is a bit jarring i feel like if the producer had put a longer pause before going into the melody it would have flowed a little more nevertheless this is the perfect late-night song or reading accompaniment song or rainy-mood song or studying song or it s just the perfect song in general tell me by yook sung jae how beautifully heartbreaking i feel like i can hear every granule every lilt every emotion in sung jae s voice and i am so emotionally overwhelmed also can we talk about the masterpiece that is the instrumentals i love orchestral sounds and they definitely delivered it in this disney soundtrack-esque song i can t believe it s over four minutes long i feel like the song ends way too quickly every time i listen to it one day by seo eunkwang instrumentals i love the strings also eunkwang s voice is so so so sweet he portrays an avalanche of emotions through every note and every word what a roller coaster yeah i knew this project would end emotionally but i wasn t expecting this a perfect night time listen or at the end of a nice romantic movie i really appreciate being able to listen to the boys shine on their own and learn the individual members styles they re so great nevertheless i m super excited for music from the whole group soon until then i ll have these tracks on repeat rating yes 59 because i am indecisive also i only included each artist once in this list unless they are featured in another artist s song
