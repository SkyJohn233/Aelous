internet forums reimagined the future of online discussions we detected that you only gave partial or no consent while we respect your choice we rely on advertisement revenue and would like to use this opportunity to ask you to reconsider and give full consent close close close close internet last year i wrote about the history of online communication and how it has evolved all the way from online bulletin board systems to social media but what does the future have in store for us in terms of communicating online the latest iteration of online communication may indeed be social media but it seems that the most popular avenue is still the old-fashioned internet forum it remains today as an excellent way to structure a community on the web while social media can be somewhat amorphous at times forums provide order and a sense of home i believe that forums will never die out but forums will evolve and adapt to advancements in web technology please join me as i take a look at a few forum software systems that are so innovative that they ll transform the concept of the forum forever moot beta is a very interesting project in my eyes because there s a bit of tension in its design philosophy it wants to take a step back into the past and recover the lost relevance of meaningful discussion which they claim have died with social media while incorporating features of the future clean and responsive interface but more importantly moot is entirely embeddable meaning you don t need to download a package and upload it to your own web host instead all of the data and control is done through your moot account and your forum theme forum content are embedded directly into your site wherever you want it to go it has been designed from the ground up for complete and easy integration other notable features that moot is pushing the mentality spurring the discourse team is the desire to raise the standard of discussion on the web through better forum software core to their actions is the belief that forums are an integral aspect of proper web communities yet most forum designs are stuck in the 1990s with discourse they want to make forum hosting easy flexible and appealing to the 21st century the discourse interface takes a lot of inspiration from social media just-in-time loading of content flat and sleek aesthetics that are indicative of social media design replying to users logging in with social media accounts real-time stream updates and more but unlike twitter tumblr pinterest and the others discourse remains faithful to big blocks of text for deeper more meaningful conversation other notable features that discourse is pushing we took a detailed look at discourse when it emerged on the scene moot and discourse are relative newcomers to the forum scene but vanilla has been innovating the forum concept for years already honestly ask anyone who has forum experience obviously which forum software is the most non-traditional and i m willing to bet that most would say vanilla vanilla has gained a lot of traction over the years big name sites like penny arcade are starting to turn to it for their discussion needs because of its cutting edge design this is a free open source project that really is revolutionizing the forum landscape other notable features that vanilla is pushing on paper these systems may not seem like a huge deviation from the usual forum platforms that we typically see however paper can be deceiving take one look at each of the solutions above and you ll notice a landslide difference in the end user experience and in my humble opinion all three systems are doing a heck of a job in refreshing the boring realm of forums do you use forums know of any other forum systems that are revolutionizing the field please

marked comment name email ok following the link to vanilla which seems to be your favorite in this article i notice that it is neither free or open source you might want to update the page to make note of that i do n't know the software they use bur debate.org is an innovative forum there 's also a small austrian startup creating a new fast and modern forum software http //ubergrape.com/ in action http //tgfred.com/ caution site language is german disclaimer i 'm working for them very reminiscent of reddit 's structure looks interesting and i 'll follow its development to see if i end up liking it thanks still better that xenforo also less expensive the open source ones another alternative to that list iroquote http //www.iroquote.com i 'm the founder and we 've been around since october 2012 before moot and discourse but we 're still in alpha our public beta will launch next week so keep an eye and experiment with our forums soon i promise there are some awesome features that you wo n't find in discourse moot nor vanilla best of luck … we ve been around since october 2012 before moot … to correct this one slightly—moot has been around since 2009 and we published our efforts to re-imagine web discussion at http //moot.it in the beginning of 2010 as for features you will or will not find in moot we launched moot open beta in april with a minimal set of features to be able to prioritize our roadmap since your post 5 days ago there 's been one update with major new unique features with several in the pipeline over the next few months oops my bad then sorry about the dates as for features i 'm positive that discourse and moot are delivering quite a lot more than iroquote but i was referring to features that can not be in these because of the nature of these products moot vanilla and discourse are forum software for *sites* or for some forum *owner* while iroquote is for communities hence you 'll find *different* features such as a democratic moderation system that enables the most trusted members to lead the community have a nice weekend iroquote does look like a unique take on the forum structure it has my interest and i 'll be following it 's development thanks for the heads up maybe you should use this for the link to vanilla http //vanillaforums.org/ it should be mentioned that discourse is open source gpl time for muo to embedded one of the above mentioned forum software in there website i still prefer the good old phpbb i 'm with you there simple machines is alright too but i 'd love for there to better spam control less intrusion with mutilple verification methods and quicker login i know i 'm dreaming no deletes good grief surely that 's an april 1 joke you mean there 's no way to delete hate speech racism libel blatant advertising and um adult content i remember a forum like that it encouraged the worst in people fortunately it died oh well i suppose that policy would save on having to pay moderators well i am sure that they might have a 'report feature also today many successful forums too are having moderators volunteering for free so that theory can be ruled out fyi muo does n't have any such thing as well you ca n't edit or delete your posts whatever content it might have anyways the post is great and an eye-opener for me i am just going to start a forum and was considering the ol mybb for that but after seeing them i am thinking of moving to one of the three services i can handle some coding some of my requirements for my forum are as follows 1 i am looking forward to make an invite-only forum mybb had a few plugins regarding the same but were big-time buggy and unupdated since months or even years 2 hosting it myself is what i 'd prefer more eliminates moot handling mybb can be sometimes a pain in the butt 3 high level of security is a top priority mybb is not updated quite regularly 4 the more flexiblity in customizing while not sacrificing ease-to-use is what i 'd prefer admin cp of mybb is quite a mess no offences 5 last but not the least transfering process from mybb should be comfortable only transfering the threads users and their posts please do tell what among the remaining two would suffice vanilla kind of looks better but i ca n't say much as i have n't checked more about both of them yet i ca n't see my previous post visible yet but just saw more about vanilla and it is not free so bad vanilla is indeed free make sure you visit .org instead of .com which is the hosting service for vanilla oops well that 's like wordpress anyways vanilla 's great but has very less plugins even after years of its inception also it does n't support thread-like conversations anyways it 's a great place to get started i prefer beehive forum software joel lee has a b.s in computer science and over six years of professional writing experience he is the editor in chief for makeuseof by dave parrack by james hirtz by moe long by emma roth by ben stegner by dave parrack by sandy
