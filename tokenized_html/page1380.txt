been quite intense for not only video games but for life as well i 've had the opportunity to travel around the world and meet some truly awesome people especially in the fighting game community they welcomed me with open arms so i wan na say thank you to them for that it has also given me the chance to acquire a new video game rival a man you may all know by the name of kenny omega i can not stand this man but i respect him as both one of the most talented professional wrestlers that i have ever seen and a gamer in the truest most dedicated sense of the word but let it be known while he

and gentlemen i present to you the one and only kenny omega kenny greetings giant bombers after austin creed tarnished the reputation of wrestlers everywhere giant bomb has called upon me to offer a more distinguished opinion for this year 's top 10 yes much like my good friend austin i too make a living as a pro wrestler if you 're only familiar with the wwe there 's a chance you 've never heard of me no problem i 'll explain i work full time in japan for the country 's largest promotion new japan pro wrestling njpw known as a member of theelite leader of the bullet club and best bout machine i m doing quite well for myself i mean i 'd rather not toot my horn but austin then do n't no one is forcing you to cont kenny buuuut if i must i 'll just come out with it i 'm a legend austin legend kenny i 'm also widely considered today 's greatest active wrestler if you need any other proof check the star ratings check the tapes check the internet just make sure if you want to see all of my accolades that you set aside a good afternoon/evening… austin are you done yet this thing is already getting to tldr status kenny not quite i also want to add you know for the readers that care about the games and stuff… i did n't think bloodborne was a bad game not at all austin as much as i would love to debate the complete opposite with you thats an article for another day lets go kenny on to the list but first a few footnotes kenny yes much like austin us traveling entertainers work upwards of 300 days a year as much as we 'd like to we ca n't play everything even though there are titles we wish we had here are the top 3 i wish i 'd played 3 deus ex mankind divided i 'm a sucker for anything cyberpunk and deus ex has always scratched that itch when i needed it the most human revolution was great and the general consensus i 've heard is that this latest installment is just as good if not better sounds like a potential top 10'er 2 doom as a kid there were only ever two reasons to own a computer first was doom the second was duke nukem 3d based on nostalgia alone i wanted to give this a shot for whatever reason i never got around to it this year 1 owlboy i 'm never one to invest all of my chips into a game or product based on a teaser trailer but owlboy sold me 1000 there 's no question about it i will play this game but i 'm also waiting/hoping/praying for a ps4 release austin alright thanks for that kenny now lets get into our top 10 gam kenny now for some honorable mentions these are games or non-games that i could n't add to the real top 10 but definitely had an impact in 2016 austin what kenny this thing is gon na be long as it is we got ta go kenny don t sweat it creed it ll only be a minute plus i checked your notes plenty we can cut if worse comes to worse 3 nes classic kenny can you even find this thing yet austin i actually was able to get hands on one as soon as it came out and we did a giveaway of an extra one on upupdowndown my youtube channel go subscribe if you have n't already but we did a giveaway so there would at least be one person out there who did n't get hit with that disgusting price gouging that people were doing on the internet kenny yes it was a shame that the shortage encouraged scalping but a noble act of you to give one away to a lucky subscriber you might not be all bad after all creed… anyhow the nes classic offers up a collection of some of the best games of all time in a cute package and in hd i must note that if i had the gall to use nes classic titles in my top 10 five or six slots could easily go to games that came out 20+ years ago and that just defeats the darn purpose of this whole thing 2 pokémon go i 'm an og pokémon fan avid player of all games watcher of the series/movies that being said i just ca n't call this a game yes it was fun yes it 's rewarding and exciting to find/hatch *insert name here* but i ca n't call it a game i ca n't and wo n't it was a cool little fad while it lasted though all three weeks of it gg 's pokémon go austin :sigh i 'll speak on this game later 1 resident evil 7 demo no main protagonists appear in the demo and nothing in the demo appears in the full game all the same how could this demo not get one hyped for re 's comeback to the numbered series upon playing the first version apart from being scared out of my britches i knew capcom was onto something revolutionary not only were we playing scared but the game consumed our thoughts post play i have complete faith that in 2017 re7 will rank high in the top 10. who knows maybe even top damn one finally the most honorable of mentions street fighter v this is a tricky one because i 've invested more time into this game than any other on this list maybe all of them combined it 's made me feel joy pain sadness it 's allowed me to make new friends establish bonds between common enemies body said enemy and embarrass them in front of tens of thousands of people austin sounds like it was a good time who is this enemy that you speak of kenny look creed you re a hero to upupdowndown subscribers everywhere and we ve long since buried the hatchet… i really don t want to embarrass you here and pour salt on those old wounds austin oh so you think you re talking about me you said you bodied him you definitely did n't body me so do n't get on your high horse kenny okay okay you had one or two rounds fair enough… besides the question isn t whether i took you to the cleaners or not it s why the heck is sfv not on the gosh darn list well i had to be fair i disqualified it yes now would be the time to explain an unwritten rule of this top ten no seasonal/evolving games no ports no hd remixes/remakes all that notwithstanding i must note that to me sfv transcends being just a game thanks to street fighter and it 's inner community the fgc i 've had some truly great memories in 2016 big thanks to them and see you all at events/online in season 2 austin well since you threw yours out there i 'll do mine as well my honorable mentions are as follows in no specific order final fantasy explorers 3ds mighty no 9 pc people got hot cause it was n't mega man ny enough sir if you wan na play mega man then go play mega man just to be clear i absolutely love mega man i may be working on a cosplay for dragoncon 2017 doom battleborn titanfall 2 kenny now for the real lists no more stall tactics here we go austin now we shall alternate between the two of us try not to get confused i think we already are beyond befuddled at this point so let 's see if this works out i 'd all but given up on fps games not that i dislike them but the market is oversaturated and i 've been burned out since cod mw3 2016 has n't had any shortage of fps titles and even though these types of stories wwi/alternate wwi have been done to death it may have been done the best ever here and wow such stellar visuals from that tweaked frostbite engine i was n't sure about mario coming to ios and then once i got hands on it i was completely in i got to interview miyamoto which was unreal but he reminded me that nintendo has been in the touch screen business way longer than iphones so it made sense that they would be able to make something that worked well and looked great it really has that nostalgic mario feel and is extremely easy to play you literally just jump the game does everything else for you it 's also a great bathroom time waster it 's so hard to find a good rpg creator for those of us who have no idea how to code i found one on my computer called rpg maker mv i was using this to create my very own rpg and i was 45 hours in yes i was actually logging my time and my computer exploded and i lost everything i wanted to burn everything to the ground anyway the ios version has been released which for me is great since i travel a ton it gives you the chance to create your own game add text build cities and pretty much anything else you wan na do so if you 're one of those creative types having a mobile rpg creator may give you an outlet for that novel you have been working on for six years and still have n't finished kenny let me guess in the fictional world you created austin creed is a half decent wrestler with segments on tv the are actually interesting austin nope i created a character named kenny omega you would have loved it the story was about him and his two buddies who were constantly stealing t-shirt designs from their rival group the new day they also appropriated hand gestures sayings and crotch chops from past eras it 's definitely a work of fiction and not based on anyone i know moving on ea with back-to-back entries on the list with games that coincidentally almost released simultaneously why titanfall over battlefield this i 'm chalking up to bias both games are done superbly well but i find that battlefield s time period limitations ultimately allow for titanfall s victory the futuristic artillery of titanfall 2 is so destructive and fun to use and though there are cool vehicles in battlefield i d rather take me a mobile suit with almost- optimus prime voice any day of the week.. many invested their faith and money into mighty no 9 being the heir to mega man throne some idiots out there some of which may be among us here even accepted it as such *cough* no way jose austin ummm wowwww name calling such a lack of class after i was kind enough to invite you into my top 10 wow kenny wow kenny invited alex navarro paid me with pizza and 5 an hour to babysit you throughout this thing we both knew you d bring up that sorry excuse for a mega man game and austin i already stated that i did n't take it as mega man it 's a different game try thinking outside of the box for once maybe if you quit wearing sunglasses indoors then you would be able to see what i mean bars got yo ass kenny anyways enter azure striker gunvolt the first installment was great better than great even the controls and story were tight art direction stylish and the j-pop was just so darn catchy take that formula add an extra character story hidden shovel knight boss fight and you 've got yourself a must own 3ds game i heard about superhot the day before it came out so i downloaded it at midnight i was planning on just playing a little bit of it for my channel upupdowndown on youtube go subscribe and then i realized that i had finished the game and hours of my life had disappeared in this fps time only advances when you 're moving and it moves as fast as you move it 's kind of wild and out-of-the-box but very enjoyable i even like the almost unfinished-looking art style it 's almost as if they were waiting to input the actual art into the game but it makes the game look unique it really allows you to focus on the puzzles at hand which get pretty complex by the end of the game this game surprised me more than any other game this year for whatever reason i was n't really expecting much so i went in with crazy low expectations started doing tutorials and the controls were soooooo complex considering you 're doing all types of fighting with all the fighters then i found knockout mode first player to get hit five times loses and the knockout animations are hysterical this kept me playing it with friends as a great local king of the couch type of game then one friend wanted to play the actual game we were all weary of the controls but learning how to play together kept us all extremely into it when one person would figure something out they would explain it to the others until our collective knowledge of the game became pretty good the point is that this is an amazingly fun game to play with friends for me it 's not so much fun alone playing online is great when people rage quit tho love that but the in-room hype between people playing this can get extremely out of hand and is n't that what we really want yes i 'm glad i 'm not a salesman because i 'd have no idea how to explain thumper to a potential customer it 's completely original frenetic and for me at least kind of panic inducing it borders on a horrific experience but still feels so satisfying when your reactions are firing on a hair trigger and you 're grooving to the music one of the best games i 'd played last year also made me feel this way and it 's something i wish i could bottle i 'm glad thumper did that in its own original way what game was i talking about oh the second best game to ever be released on sega cd road avenger duh i 'll come clean with everyone kirby is my favorite nintendo ip and kirby 's dreamland for the nes is my favorite game for the system that 's right kirby not mario 3 get over it long story short i 'm a fanboy 4-life and always down for any and every new kirby game from now until the end of time that 's not to say they 're all good though epic yarn was n't a top 10 game and the difficulty or lack thereof really hurt its fun factor this game is n't the dark souls of kirby by any stretch but it recaptures the old nes spirit while adding more power-ups and the ultimate destructive power of mechs i love that this became a thing in kirby great job hal you know this would n't be an austin creed list if there was n't a koei game on here aot rocked the world for those that had n't read the manga when the anime dropped this game places you right into the aot universe and you actually feel what it 's like to fly around cutting up titans and saving the city you love after an intensive tutorial the controls are kind of bonkers but so worth it you gain the knowledge of how to use the movement gear to spider-man around all over the place while slashing titans necks up the game follows the storyline of the show and still has that dynasty warriors feel you can play as different characters and upgrade your weapons which helps as the titans grow in strength overall it 's a really fun hack- n-slash game that 's even more fun if you 've ever wanted to be a member of the survey corps i would never in real life real titans would be absolutely terrifying not a game that hit crazy big on the charts but i believe it should have oh sir is a game that was created at game jam a gathering of people who each build a game in about 72 hours it won there and then was later fleshed out into a full game the premise is that two people argue in the most polite manner possible and the person with the best insults wins words are chosen from a collective word pool in the middle of the screen and then each player has two words or phrases that only they can select the better the insult the more damage is done insults are all created by the player and can range from things like your mother has never seen star wars and smells like a nazi to your hovercraft is disgusting and your father looks like your math teacher sir my favorite part about this is that you can play online with other humans i can not explain the joy of properly insulting another human so eloquently and then having my hand raised in victory i think i enjoy this game so much because it reminds me of the continuous conversations i 've had with kenny me eloquently verbally ripping him apart while he frantically and desperately mumbles his way along trying to string words together to form a sentence maybe we inspired them to make this game first off i 'm a huge fan of couch co-op call me old fashioned but i almost could n't care less about online functionality in games i 've passed up a ton of otherwise great games because they skipped out on a couch co-op function that should have been there shame on you guys btw thankfully broforce did n't do that in fact i feel as though this game was made for guys like me '80s/'90s action movie buffs nonstop fun and laughs from start to finish and really the only gripe i have with this game is that there was an end it 's not the goat of all ff titles but it never had to be it 's still awesome and great balance of old and new so was it worth the wait yes yes it was truthfully i feel guilty for having to place this game where it is on the list it has everything it takes to be 2 or heck maybe even 1 and yet my lifestyle on the road prevents me from enjoying it more i want to grind and i want to enjoy the huge world but these things take so much time and i rarely had enough to feel satisfied with a single session of course ffxv has its share of problems the framerate is erratic the camera will sometimes lose its mind during battle but well that s really it i ve heard complaints about combat and music but i love both actually no huge qualms from me plus you ll hear more from creed so i ll wrap this up by saying that this game and series are alive and well i will continue to scour the lands complete side quests and play/pay for any dlc upcoming give me gilgamesh battle on the big bridge and give me the damn death train w/ sabin obviously this is on my list considering my respect for the all mighty zenyatta i played as him before his insane buff so do n't get any ideas when this game dropped i was n't sure what all of the hype was about my head was involved in all kinds of other things so at launch i was n't phased while everyone else was drooling all over themselves but when i finally played it a few weeks later then i understood this is one of the most fun fps games that i 've ever played also there is no story mode but blizzard managed to create stories for each of the characters and put them online for us to watch between these videos and the various pieces of lore published around the internet suddenly overwatch becomes a very story intensive game watching these stories and learning why each character is the way that they are really creates a solid bond between player and the various personalities in the game i 've come to hate the words high noon and found myself running away when i heard them in real life once not proud of myself one thing that kenny and i do agree on is that this game is incredible street fighter has been wild this year i do n't think i 've ever been into a street fighter as much as this one i 've played them all my life but never trained to make an attempt at defeating a rival who trains with world champions first off the community for street fighter is amazing getting the chance to be welcomed into the fcg has been really cool that definitely adds to my enjoyment of the game there are so many excellent people who are willing to take their time to help you get better if you 're willing to put the time in now the game it was definitely rough at the beginning and people were upset with the lack of characters and content at this point that 's literally the last problem they have there are all kinds of skins and stages plus even more stuff coming out all of next year playing the game is beyond fun even if you 're trash at it and i 'm a prime example of that if this is indeed drake 's last adventure what a way to close the series flawless storytelling lush environments great set pieces gameplay that feels fluid and organic all that and they still fit in a cameo from crash bandicoot it 's that high standard of quality we 've come to expect from an uncharted game and it never fails to be the cadillac of all aaa franchises in terms of in game performances nolan north steals the show but that is n't taking away anything from the rest of the cast an immersive cinematic and interactive masterpiece that is a must own for ps4 owners i had used the words flawless and near perfect to describe uncharted 4 and i 'm gon na do it again here this takes the tried tested and addictive formula of pokémon and spreads improvements across the board the visuals music story added features some serious time and effort went into this game and you can tell game freak /nintendo intended this to be the pokémon title of the year i 've beaten the main quest and am still playing at around 88 hours in for all that wan na know i went with rowlet as a starter my leader however and easily new favorite pokémon btw is the almighty mimikyu clearly this was going on my list considering that i 'm kind of obsessed with rpgs and specifically the final fantasy franchise plus my square enix bias but anyway i 'm sure you all have either by now played and beat it or at least seen someone playing it obviously it 's final fantasy so there are certain tropes that we 're going to get in vii we got the hard-ass protagonist who thinks he does n't need anyone to get by in x we got the protagonist with daddy issues that effect all of the decisions he makes through the story in xiii we got our headstrong female protagonist who could most likely put us all in body bags i really liked lightning and now in xv we actually have gone back to a trope previously used in x-2 in x-2 the story revolved around a female pop group similar to jem and the holograms with how they could magically change clothes and crank out sweet tunes in xv we find ourselves controlling the leader of the hottest new boy band to hit eos hair gelled and ready to get young prince noctis to his betrothed his crew of ignis the smart one gladiolus the rugged one and prompto the shy one all are integral players in this story on a serious note it 's actually really cool to see the relationship between these characters play out especially on the car rides by not skipping them you get a chance to hear banter between the boys which makes you feel like you 're really on a road trip with these guys that sort of feeling feels rare in games nowadays it 's become harder and harder for me to actually feel like i 'm a part of the game as i get older i 'm not sure if it 's me changing or the games but regardless this one made me feel like i was part of the crew even from the start you begin by pushing a car that has run out of gas so brutal but it 's actually cool because the contemporary soundtrack brings out certain emotions that i do n't think would have arisen otherwise they also did a great job of making me care about each of the characters to the point that i almost cried when one of them was killed it was during a live stream hard times man also the fact that while you 're in the car you can listen to the soundtracks from the previous games gives you a customizable experience it 's great for people who have been fans from day one and also for people who are new to final fantasy and jrpgs in general the fact that they were able to make these two types of people mix and have something to talk about with each other is pretty cool the goal is always to draw everyone in and make sure they enjoy the experience and that 's exactly what this game does every part of it minus the chapter where you do n't have your weapons and ca n't run it 's way too long and i may have almost had an aneurysm sarcasm while trying to finish it other than that i loved it i already know what some of you who have played this are going to say but this game became so repetitive waaaa waaaa waaaa :stands up and pushes chair to the table you know what else is repetitive dynasty warriors final fantasy rpgs in general brushing your teeth street fighter all fighting games for that matter waking up breathing shooters and yes even the process of getting a game playing a game finishing a game then getting a new game but these things are also all amazing especially dynasty warriors so let 's agree to set this nonproblem aside as we talk about how incredible this game is i felt an immediate attachment to this game from the time that i saw a video explaining the story and mechanics at e3 you play as lincoln clay a soldier who has just come back from serving in the vietnam war he happens to be black and this story is set in a time where black people were treated quite poorly by a lot of the american population not to get to real and make things too serious but this really hit home for me and drew me into wanting to play it in the first place no punches are pulled with the language and how lincoln is treated by many people through the game there is even a disclaimer at the beginning pretty much stating that you 're gon na hear a lot of pretty horrible racial slurs so prepare yourself the fact that they were not afraid to make it feel as real as possible with the current social climate really made me respect the people that worked on this game even more than i normally would if this aspect of the game would not have been included then it would have felt like a regular open world mob game which might have been fine but would n't have had nearly the same impact so kudos to 2k and hangar 13 for having the balls to really dig into some serious stuff at one point you legit have to fight the kkk like what this is a thing that i 'm doing right now inflammatory images inflammatory speech inflammatory story and you get the chance to overcome all of it i love it now as far as the actual game goes it 's gorgeous the soundtrack is amazing you really feel like you 've gone back in time to this era and the story is so strong that if you let it then it will suck you in completely the controls are intuitive the side quests are interesting and taking over parts of the city really enhances the story when you take a section of the city you give it to one of your three underbosses and if one feels left out then a side mission opens where they 'll turn on you forcing you to take them out it 's great that your choices over time essentially mold how the story unfolds then once you make it to the end of the story then there are three separate endings that have awesome cinematics explaining how events unfold after you take over the city i 've never played the other mafia games so i 'm not sure how many similarities this one has to the earlier games but i do know that this one is beyond incredible on so many levels in my opinion mafia iii is the best game released in 2016 i 'm thinking this may be a shocking choice to some but all things considered i ca n't deny that this was my goty i ca n't remember a game in recent memory that i had so much trouble putting down that even when it felt impossible sometimes unfairly so that i could n't stop even after encountering a bad room or an unlucky loadout there was always a feeling of progression and a feeling of ok one more run motherfucker it harkened to the old nes days not so much where games were a lengthy grind but a collection of white-knuckle sprints countless oh-so-close throw your controller at the wall moments and then that one special legendary run where the stars align and you do the impossible those moments especially when shared with friends live forever i 'm nostalgic for stuff like that so bringing back those old castlevania and ninja gaiden -esque feelings carries a ton of weight with me i hope to see more of the gungeon from dodge roll and devolver digital in the future if the characters past scenarios are any indication there 's huge potential for varied environments and even deeper stories/situations to explore austin and that 's it those are our top 10 games of 2016 kenny thanks for sticking with us till the end austin i 'm actually really surprised that we got all the way through this without killing each other i 'm proud of us kenny yeah and you know something your choices were pretty good could i maybe suggest shorter reviews next time though i felt myself nodding off a bit towards the end austin this coming from the guy with five honorable mentions before the top 10 perhaps a friendly game to snap you out your drowsiness def jam windjammers mario kart kenny i ll pass creed we got our work cut out for us if we re gon na do this again in 2017 austin speaking of tekken 7 drops next year so if you want it in that then i would be glad to handle you again kenny you would have the audacity to challenge me in a game that s officially partnered with my company in japan oh austin the size of your ego never ceases to amaze me you do remember what happened the last time you challenged me in a fighting game right austin yeah yeah yeah we know you beat me in street fighter always bringing up old stuff that 's your problem you 're living in the past 2017 means there will be tons of new games for me to obliterate you in kenny yes and since there s no way giant bomb will ask you back for another top 10 you can just focus on one or two of them and get reeeeally good at them well… for you anyway austin my god even though you have been so rude i 'll let you close this thing out i 'm a man of class unlike you kenny you re g-rated television you have to have more class than me but hey as a friend i ll keep it clean for the next few sentences austin we are pg like shrek and shrek is hilarious kenny thanks for everything folks those are our lists agree disagree wondering where your favorite game s were well if you have problems i assure you it s all austin s fault so just leave some negative feedback on his youtube channel and remember that i tried my absolute best to carry him through this sucker austin by negative comments he of course means positive comments and likes it helps my algorithms and whatnot got ta get those likes on my videos to keep this thing gaining steam do n't play with my channel kenny do n't play kenny happy holidays even to austin and thanks for reading austin oh one more thing this would n't be a top 10 from me unless there was a rant of some sort so here it is austin ok so if you 're like me or anyone else who has a heart pumping blood through their veins then you probably downloaded pokémon go considering i 'm basically a 12-year-old with a bank account i was stomping my feet waiting for this to drop when it finally did then it was like the world was overrun with happiness but for me it was n't long until this happiness turned to pure rage for maybe two months i was a devoted playing-every-single-day type of person i could deal with the stalling out while trying to overtake a gym i could deal with my gps not realizing i was literally on top of a pokéstop i could even deal with the app freezing when i was trying to catch a charizard in the middle of times square at 5:30 a.m. this really happened what i could not deal with was the realization that the only two things that i and all of my friends wanted would not be added to the game all we wanted was to be able to trade and fight each other considering that we put so much time into this and possibly money possibly we got pissed 'cause we wanted to trade this may have upset me way more than it should have but c'mon man to me that 's what pokémon is built on trading and fighting and we ca n't do that i have just tried to forget about go while i 've been playing through sun and it 's definitely helping my mood towards pokémon but the app lies dormant on my phone taunting me daily as i wait and hope for a brighter tomorrow i just wan na be the very best alex
