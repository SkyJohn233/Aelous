Relatives Dream Interpretation and Meaning | Sleep Culture Sleep Culture By  Carrie | Family | Be the first to comment! Dream about Relatives Obviously, dreaming about relatives is pretty common and can be loaded with lots of things. Dreaming about different types of relatives can mean different things. If you dream about your cousin or cousins, it can mean that you feel a break from anxiety and worry about to come up in your life. (Good news!) Kind of along the same lines are dreams about your aunts or uncles. The presence of these relatives signifies money issues—not necessarily good or bad, but if you’re dreaming about your aunts and uncles, chances are you’ve got money on the brain. Dreaming about other relatives that aren’t in your immediate family have to do with seeking help or receiving help when it’s needed. As you can imagine, immediate family members appearing in your dreams have their own interpretations. Fathers usually symbolize authority. If you dream about your dad, you could be headed for or in the middle of a positive transition in your professional life—your business or career. Mothers usually symbolize love. So if you dream about your mom, you might be on the verge of a change in your love life, or in one of your close relationships. Dreams about siblings depend on the sex of the dreamer and of the sibling. For a woman, dreaming about a good relationship with your sister could mean that you are currently feeling emotionally stable. For a man, dreaming about a sister can mean something similar—emotional security. Dreaming about brothers in general can mean relationship security. Dreams about good times with brothers signify financial stability. Powered by the inLine Minimal WordPress Theme
