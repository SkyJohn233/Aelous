the effects of estradiol and selective estrogen receptor modulators on gene expression and messenger rna stability in immortalized sheep endometrial stromal cells and human endometrial adenocarcinoma cells farnell yz 1 ing nh author information 1 departments of animal science faculty of genetics texas a amp m university college station tx 77843-2471 usa. p the purpose of this study was to identify an endometrial cell line thatmaintained the e2 up-regulation of estrogen receptor er mrna by enhancedmessage stability and to assess its dependence on er protein estradiol e2 effects on gene expression were measured in three cell lines one immortalizedfrom sheep endometrial stroma st and two from human endometrial adenocarcinomas ishikawa and ecc-1 e2 up-regulated er mrna levels in st and ishikawa cells but down-regulated er mrna levels in ecc-1 cells e2 up-regulated progesteronereceptor pr glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh and transforminggrowth factor-alpha tgf-alpha in both ishikawa and ecc-1 cells the selectiveestrogen receptor modulator ici 182,780 antagonized the e2-induced up-regulation of er and/or pr mrna levels in all three cells while another gw 5638 antagonized the up-regulation of pr mrna in ishikawa and ecc-1 cells inmechanistic studies e2 had no effect on er mrna stability in st cells and itdestabilized er mrna in ecc-1 cells thus ishikawa cells appear to be the mostphysiologically relevant cell line in which to study the up-regulation of er mrnalevels by enhanced mrna stability its antagonism by ici 182,780 reveals that er protein is involved in this e2 response
