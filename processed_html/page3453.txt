Theanti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects of VCO were assessed. Inacute inflammatory models, VCO showed moderate anti-inflammatory effects on ethylphenylpropiolate-induced ear edema in rats, and carrageenin- and arachidonicacid-induced paw edema. VCO exhibited an inhibitory effect on chronicinflammation by reducing the transudative weight, granuloma formation, and serum alkaline phosphatase activity. VCO also showed a moderate analgesic effect on theacetic acid-induced writhing response as well as an antipyretic effect inyeast-induced hyperthermia. The results obtained suggest anti-inflammatory,analgesic, and antipyretic properties of VCO. ><
