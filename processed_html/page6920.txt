He has always thought that music and art are connected strongly (I can tell Dephect agree!) and the creation of images / songs follow similar patterns and structure.  His weapon of choice is a humble biro, it is perfect for the degrees of shading and detail needed for his illustrations. He often combines these sketches with bold, geometric graphics in Photoshop. He has made a slow transition from robotic, industrial styles to organic, floral and natural subject matter.
