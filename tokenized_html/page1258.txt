newsletters and confirm that i have read and understood penguin random house 's privacy policy warning spoilers below i was saying uh-oh before episode three of the fall had even started as the bbc announcer said bringing spector to justice is about to become even more difficult. but the warning was for detective superintendent stella as we viewers already knew serial murder suspect spector had supposedly lost his long-term memory – conveniently just enough to cover all the killings well all the killings we knew about the episode opened with a forensic scientist and stella separately poring over the sinister drawings of women that the police found in a series of exercise books in spector s lock-up along with ladies underwear – a lot of ladies underwear and we can t really imagine it was for him one woman was drawn in underwear with her hands tied another was prostrate on the ground with dirty whore written on her back on top of bondage they detailed auto-asphyxiation not the kind of graphic novel you would ever pick off the shelf so stella sent her team off to hunt for the women with just their initials to go on for instance a.s. who might be a journalist who seems to wake up late every day and skip breakfast who wears a cream robe after her bath and sometimes doesn t completely close her bedroom curtains. hmmmm bit close to home with her laser eyes now glazed and dulled and her voice growing ever croakier stella just about summoned up the strength to muse are they just fantasies that sustain him feed his appetites or are they a record – of nine more murders later on dishy ds anderson who we are not seeing nearly enough of came up with some intriguing goods relating to a man convicted of murder who was at the same children s home as spector wrongly convicted two killers more of this twist to come we had another possible flicker of an insight into steely stella s hidden human side when she interviewed traumatised kidnap victim rose stagg rose remember you survived you got through it it s in the past she whispered suddenly looking downwards as though talking to herself… or about herself meanwhile back at the dingy hospital – which seems to exist in a permanent night zone – a doctor continued to test spector s memory he remembered his in-laws that his own mother died and that his father wasn t his father another possible clue to his twisted psyche when i was growing up he was known as peter baldwin i thought that man was my real father till he left us my mother told me he wasn t my real father just a man. and though he d heard of facebook he had no idea what twitter was so you don t know what a tweet is or tweeting said dr walden the sound a bird makes he replied reminding us of the far-far away era when we all thought that as to his moral character the look dr walden gave him when he said quizzically i feel like i m an all right person was utterly priceless he has so far convinced the doctors but the police chiefs and dpp were another matter when stella broke the bad news of spector s memory loss to them acc burns asked the obvious question are we meant to be taking this seriously fraid so guv but tough dpp lowden wasn t phased the law does not concern itself with the present state of mind of the criminal defendant only with the state of mind at the time the crime was committed and spector s was clearly conveyed in his confession… he will be held accountable. clearly an optimist those final five words are fatal and spector certainly seemed to be on the ball looking for escape routes when he was taken down a hospital corridor for his appearance in court via video link but he s about to be moved from the hospital to a forensic clinic to face a whole new expert dr august larson and from what we have seen so far there are no flies on him on the pitifully sad side of things the human stella also tried to persuade them to drop the prosecution against spector s shattered wife sally for perverting the course of justice but failed this led to bleak shots of the now zombified sally drugging her children with hot milk and taking them on quite the wrong kind of trip to the seaside if she plunges them all into the waves that will no doubt send spector over the edge too as the episode also showed just how much he adores his daughter this series takes the slow-drip approach to piling on the agony the painful pace was slower than ever at this halfway point leaving us feeling we are crawling through the plot on our stomachs which is starting to get annoying like those twittering birds we are being tossed mere breadcrumbs where other crime dramas serve up full loaves so once again we were left hungry for more wondering just who is heading for that fall please please let the next three episodes bring
