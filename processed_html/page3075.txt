What Size Tarp? : camping Sorry for the noob question here. I just bought a Coleman Sundome 4 person tent and I was wondering what size tarp I should get. For reference, I live in Texas where itâ€™s hot and rains a lot. Tent dimensions are 9 x 7. Thank you in advance for your time and assistance! Do you mean a tarp for beneath your tent? If so, get one just big enough and be sure to fold the edges underneath your tent. You don &# x27;t want water pooling under you while you sleep. If you meant something else, please ask, I &# x27;m sure someone here will be able to help. To follow up on what he said. If it isn &# x27;t for under your tent and it &# x27;s for over it like a rainfly you can really go as bug as you want because it &# x27;ll just provide even more protection but you want it to be big enough that it over hangs on all sides of the tent a little bit. Yes, Iâ€™m looking for one to put between the tent and the ground. Do I want the tarp to be the same (or close to the same) dimensions as the tent? Do I want it smaller or larger? Thank you all for the help! I appreciate you sharing your wisdom ðŸ˜Š 1.2m Campers 908 Planning their next camp Jul 18, 2008 Cake Day
