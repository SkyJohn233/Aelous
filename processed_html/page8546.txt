Super Low Rust Experimental FPS.. : playrust My specs are as listed: 8gb of DDR3, intel i3 quad core clocked@ 3.37ghz, nvidia GT GeForce 610. Let me know if i am missing anything. Can anyone help me out. Your processor might be the biggest problem here, Rust uses quite a bit of it alongside the video card as far as I know Thank you for a more constructed response. :D Make sure you &# x27;re using your graphics card as default, that &# x27;s what happened to me. Right click on your desktop and go to nvidia control panel and find default processor, then change it to your graphics card. Ill say it this way: Your graphic card is not suitable for games, and Rust is unoptimized quite a bit (although they did a great job on that already) and needs quite a bit GPU and CPU power to run. your card is in red box, at very bottom, with a score of 355. You didnt actually said your friends GPU, but you said he have GT 440, which have 821 points (more than double the power you have)  Here you can see comparsion To maximize your FPS: When launching, select lowest graphic option, ingame press F2 and set all to minimum. But I doubt you will get any decent playable FPS, though. Dont understand why I got downvoted for providing actuall reason and even info to possible solution. People are strange You have a bad computer, that &# x27;s why; I hope you enjoy games like AoE cus that &# x27;s all you &# x27;re going to get out of a 610. I have a friend with 2gb of ram, dual core processor, and a nvidia 400 series. He runs it at like 40 frames.. I run it at 10 fps. Explain that? It &# x27;s not a terrible computer it should be doing more i think. 160k nakeds 904 riding horses Jun 16, 2013 Cake Day
