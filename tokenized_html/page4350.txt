fergusson 988t a faitly typical table top set of the early 50 's about the only unusual thing with the set is to do with differences between the ac and dc mains a second fuse holder allows the py82 ht rectifier to be bypassed enabling every last volt of dc mains to be utilised the under-chassis components can be accesed by removing a cover from the underside of the set to aid servicing as with many sets from the era an additional cyldon tuner has been fitted to enable reception of band iii signals the same chassis was used in a console version model 983 but with a luxury push-pull audio output has probably had a hard life note the two fuse holders no fuses but plenty of aluminium foil the dc operation fuse sorry foil is fitted so presumably i hope this set was last used on dc mains the band iii tuner is scary its mounted within a fraction of the eht rectifier and where the eht connects to the crt sounds like fun the audio output transformer is mounted on the top of the cabinet so in the past the wires to the chassis have been cut to enable the chassis to be removed call me picky but i 'd have insulated the wires when they were re-joined there is a good layer of dust and cobwebs but that just means the set has n't been messed with during its hibernation but oh dear fresh looking wood worm holes on one side of the cabinet so after posing for photo 's it was wrapped in polythene and temporarily relegated to the concrete garage
