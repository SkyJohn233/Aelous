Commodore KIM-1 Donor: (Still looking it up...) Location: Williamsburg, Virginia This is the very first computer that Commodore ever made. It's the single board KIM-1. It has an on-boardkeypad and 6 digit LED read-out. Of course, real techies didn't leave their single board computers just sitting out in the open.Oh no. They built really cool cases for them. This particular case featured a flip-top, a card cage for theRAM board, an extension of thekeypad and display to the front of the enclosure, a bunch of connections on the backand a terminal hook-up. (And, of course, the requiredswitch to choose between keypad and terminal.) There's also a very manly external power supply.
