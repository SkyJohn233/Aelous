no idea took him about 20 minutes of digging into my file notes and looking at old promotions to find it eventually he had to get help from his supervisor who said he had been doing overrides all day to get those sent to customers who were supposed to get a free stand i d call the customer support line – snoopysmom13 0 points 1 point 2 points 6 months ago 0 children if it gives you any idea of a
