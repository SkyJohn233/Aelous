Mac Miller -  " Brand Name "  [Official Video] Posted  by zo September 18, 2015 9:46 AM It s been a busy week for Pittsburgh MC  Mac Miller . At the top of the week, his major label debut  GO:OD AM  went up to stream via NPR s First Listen. Today, the album is officially released along with a contemplative new clip for the retro-fit single  Brand Name.  The video is a contemplative one, finding Miller assuming the blue collar grind with a wife and kids, but quickly realizing the nine to five life isn t quite all it s made out to be.  GO:OD AM  is now here in its entirety, featuring production from  DJ Dahi, Thundercat, Sounwave, Tyler, The Creator,  with mic-sharing duties falling upon  Ab-Soul, Lil B, Miguel, Chief Keef  and  Little Dragon .
