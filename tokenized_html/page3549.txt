jasmine jonte home facebook i ve walked a million miles to chase down my own desires out of fire sea and stone born to find that great unknown and when i find myself im ma bring it on home ********************** the magic is where you are never are you without it you are the love the magic you re looking for and when you have a moment of loneliness thinking that you are without our personal growth family see the illusion we walk with you we are in the words you say and the feels you feel we are in every learning come alive and when you have a moment of doubt thinking that some seminar something or seminar someone was only a fantasy never to be had in physical reality see the illusion you are faith in human form that fantasy is only your beginning and it s coming sooner than you think because you feel doubt and choose to see the illusion anyway you choose to believe and when you are called crazy koolaid or the like say thank you that s the best time to practice all that we have learned what a gift be in love with the naysayers because your gentle quiet certainty is mountains stronger than loud weak words and your gentle quiet certainty teaches it shows that there is another way you leave footsteps to follow not just empty quotes we are here we are in personal growth because we have been called to give we have been called to help the world evolve to peace to compassion loving kindness is our way be happy to be home in the midst of all of it because the seminar vacuum helps us grow but it s outside the vacuum that the world changes and you my darling are the difference maker as always check on your strong friends if you feel like other difference makers need this message today please share i love you thank you before 2020
