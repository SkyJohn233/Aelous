The packages found in this section of the site are provided, maintained, and moderated by the community. Every version of each package undergoes a rigorous moderation process before it goes live that typically includes: More detail at  Security  and  Moderation .                     If you are an organization using Chocolatey, we want your experience to be fully reliable.                    Due to the nature of this publicly offered repository,  reliability  cannot be guaranteed.                    Packages offered here are subject to distribution rights, which means they may need to reach out further to the internet to the official locations to download files at runtime.                                     Fortunately, distribution rights do not apply for internal use. With any edition of Chocolatey (including the free open source edition), you can  host your own packages  and cache or  internalize  existing community packages.                 Your use of the packages on this site means you understand they are not supported or guaranteed in any way.  Learn more...

Chocolatey's Community Package Repository currently does not allow updating package metadata on the website. This helps ensure                            that the package itself (and the source used to build the package) remains the one true                            source of package metadata.                         This does require that you increment the package version. 2 Passing Test  Validation Testing Passed  Verification Testing Passed To install Git Large File Storage (Install), run the following command from the command line or from PowerShell: To upgrade Git Large File Storage (Install), run the following command from the command line or from PowerShell: To uninstall Git Large File Storage (Install), run the following command from the command line or from PowerShell: NOTE: This applies to both open source and commercial editions of Chocolatey.

Git Large File Storage (LFS) replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise.
