It’s a no-brainer -- social media is taking over the way we communicate every day. Sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram help keep up with the news both locally and internationally. The Boston Bombings? First heard on Twitter. Ravens win the Superbowl? Unfortunately, first seen on Instagram. And Sally and Jimmy breaking up? They just made it Facebook official. All of these examples are neither positive nor negative aspects of social media, and you can take them how you want them, but a truly good feature of these networks is that it gives us an outlet to share all things fitness and health with the world. According to a 2013 statistic, Facebook has reached more than 665 daily active users, and Twitter has seen a 44 percent growth from June 2012 to March 2013. These figures will only continue to grow with the rising accessibility of apps on smartphones, which provide constant access. On Twitter, plenty of users can link us to information regarding our health and well-being. These users can help us learn the latest fitness or healthy eating trends, while giving us ideas for new routines. There is no better example of ideas for new routines than the life-consuming Pinterest. There is even a Health  &  Fitness category dedicated to helping people share their favorite tricks and healthy snacks. I spend hours flipping through these various ideas, and whether I actually attempt them varies. But someone somewhere is using them, and I’m sure it’s making them very happy! And who knows, maybe if you search or pin these tips enough, it will actually inspire you to make a change. So, if you want to cook healthier meals, research Pinterest. If you want instant motivation to go workout, check out Facebook. Finally, if you want quick health tips, log on to Twitter. Sometimes, all you need is that extra push to get going.
