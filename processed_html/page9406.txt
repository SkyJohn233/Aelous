York Housing Association : Gardens and External Areas On some schemes we are responsible for all grounds maintenance, but in the case of tenants having their own gardens, they are responsible for keeping this in a clean and tidy condition. If anyone is having problems in doing their own gardening we can put them in touch with some agencies that would do this for a small fee.  We would also ask that any unwanted items, such as fridges, sofas etc are not left out in the garden or on the estate, but are disposed of correctly.  Most councils will take away large items for a fee, and you need to contact your local authority.  If you are not in a position to do this, please contact your Housing Officer, who will be happy to give you more advice. 10 Mar 2017 12 Jul 2017 More Events  |  More News Our site uses cookies.
