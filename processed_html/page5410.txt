Can you hatch the region locked? : TheSilphRoad I remember being told you could hatch the region locked pokemon when pokemon go first started but I still haven &# x27;t heard of anyone doing so. Can anyone verify this? Not possible. Notice how people stopped claiming they hatched after the location caught was added to the bottom of the mon screen? It is possible to hatch region locked Pokemon  if  you collect the egg from a pokestop in the appropriate region. The location at the bottom of the screen will say where you picked up the egg, not where you hatched it. I hatched a Mr. Mime in Murica. I got the egg from Europe though. I was pretty surprised/confused at the time. This was back in summer, so the theory about hatching wasn &# x27;t quite clear back then. And I caught them Tauros, ooohhhh yeeaaahh. You can only hatch it if you picked the egg up in that area, for me I can hatch a farfetched but not the others. If I was to go to Europe and pick up eggs then I could hatch a Mr. Mime. This was confirmed by John (cant remember last name) the Niantic guy on twitter awhile back NO. NO. NO. Even after the 1001st post about that, it still isn &# x27;t possible to hatch foreign region locked mons. All those who miracolously hatched a Tauros in Europe or Kangaskhan in the states are just cheaters. Or picked up eggs whilst on holliday abroad. It is possible to hatch region locked Pokemon  if  you collect the egg from a pokestop in the appropriate region. No Live in Adel Aust and haven &# x27;t heard of anyone hatching a Kanga at all either - hatched just about everything else (theres heaps here in the wild tho). - Has anyone else ever hatched their own regionals? I think OP means can you even hatch them within the region they &# x27;re spawning in? Has anyone confirmed that at least? 482k Travelers 4.2k Currently Traveling Jan 24, 2016 Cake Day
