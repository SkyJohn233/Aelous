Mia Vaile - Money paroles | Musixmatch Just knowJust know Just know, that I've missed you so, so soBut it's a shame that I'm caught up in my own shitWith the cash flow, but you know I'll still say, "Hello"I've been so sleepless, a little too highA little too reckless, loving my lifeBut the thought it still drifts like a memoryThink that's exactly where the end beginsIt was over when I let vanity winWhen you asked where I've beenWhen the money came inIt was over when I let everything goWhen I needed less loansWhen you needed me mostBut I love the way you love meAnd I'm sorry, but it's all about the moneyI love the way you love meAnd I'm sorry, but it's all about the moneyEverything I do, you know I do it for the moneyEverything I say, I only say it for the moneyEverything is everything when everything is moneyMoneyMoney â€œ And I &# x27;m sorry, but it &# x27;s all about the money â€”  Mia Vaile So go, let me show you to the doorBut will you stop me? Try and fight me?In my own home, like a heavy price tagMy God, look what happened to the criticThe only one left is the voice inside my headSaying, "Watch them watching you forever"And pretending that you're deadBut the rule, don't you forget itThat goodbyes are see you latersSo say fuck it, hold the paperWrite a check for all the hatersIt was over when I let vanity winWhen you asked where I've beenWhen the money came inIt was over when I let everything goWhen I needed less loansWhen you needed me mostBut I love the way you love meAnd I'm sorry, but it's all about the moneyI love the way you love meAnd I'm sorry, but it's all about the moneyEverything I do, you know I do it for the moneyEverything I say, I only say it for the moneyEverything is everything when everything is moneyMoneyMoney Offre exclusive Obtenez jusqu &# x27;Ã  3 mois de musique gratuite Vous obtiendrez 3 mois gratuits si vous nâ€™avez pas dÃ©jÃ  utilisÃ© la version dâ€™essai gratuite dâ€™Apple Music Listen to any song with synced lyrics on your mobile ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Fait avec amour  &  passion en Italie. ðŸŒŽ ApprÃ©ciÃ© partout Nous utilisons des cookies pour personnaliser le contenu, les annonces et fournir une meilleure expÃ©rience.
