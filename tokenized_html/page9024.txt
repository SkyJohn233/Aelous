is revenge a healthy emotion dr. helen i skimmed over a new book by law professor thane rosenbaum entitled payback the case for revenge the title was intriguing and the book description sounded interesting revenge rosenbaum argues is not the problem it is in fact a perfectly healthy emotion instead the problem is the inadequacy of lawful outlets through which to express it he mounts a case for legal systems to punish the guilty commensurate with their crimes as part of a societal moral duty to satisfy the needs of victims to feel avenged indeed the legal system would better serve the public if it gave victims the sense that vengeance was being done on their behalf drawing on a wide range of support from recent studies in behavioral psychology and neuroeconomics to stories of vengeance and justice denied to revenge practices from around the world to the way in which revenge tales have permeated popular culture—including hamlet the godfather and braveheart—rosenbaum demonstrates that vengeance needs to be more openly and honestly discussed and lawfully practiced in the introduction the author says that human beings long for justice and fairness we accept legal rulings when justice is served not simply when the law has spoken if we do n't feel the just in justice we will walk away from the law like any unavenged victim who knows hat the score remains unsettled and that payback is still owed this is why running away from revenge pretending that reclaiming honor is not an honorable pursuit presents similar moral consequences as living in a society where the guilty go unpunished while citizens are asked to accept that justice was done in our collective pc society there are many instances of unfairness on a regular basis the man who is falsely accused of rape while his accuser suffers no consequences the student who is denied a degree based on her political beliefs or the man who has his children taken away because he is unfairly accused of sexual abuse the anger and feelings of distrust are swept under the rug by society but the feelings inside stay bubbling beneath the surface but there nonetheless we do a disservice by telling people to get over it for without justice or what the author calls revenge our citizens have no trust and hence no moral obligation to be fair to each other https //pjmedia.com/drhelen/2013/4/11/is-revenge-a-healthy-emotion/
