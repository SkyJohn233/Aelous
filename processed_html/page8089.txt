2018 Best Places to Work Nominations - Cincinnati Business Courier Help the Business Courier identify and recognize the Cincinnati-area employers that have the most engaged workforces. A special publication will be created by the Courier profiling the finalists and winners. The format is an online, anonymous survey of employees consisting of about 50 questions. The survey is conducted through an independent market research company Quantum Workplace. The contest is open to any company located in the 15-county Greater Cincinnati region with more than 10 employees. All nominees will be contacted the week of July 9th with instructions for administering the survey to their employees.  All surveys must be completed by August 10th.  An announcement of the companies named as finalists will be made in late August. An awards program will be held on October 18th.  No companies will be identified as having taken the survey unless they make the finalists level. Why participate? All participants will receive a one-page, category overview report, with the option to purchase more in-depth, detailed results.  The winners will receive a complimentary workplace audit showing their complete results and how they compare to other companies. There is no cost to participate.  Only ONE nomination is required for participation in this program. This program would not be possible without the generous support of our sponsors.
