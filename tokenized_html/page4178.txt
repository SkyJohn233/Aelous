feet you can almost hear their sighs of relief already the older people get the more it seems they obsess about the weather perhaps it s because they have more time to do things and want to know the forecast ahead or maybe like me they re just total weather nerds who love to see if they can beat their local forecaster as to who most accurately predicts the weather whatever the reason a weather station is always a super popular present and this one from la crosse technology has some features that make it a step up from the others we love the colorful lighted display that shows the time day and date as well as interior and exterior temperatures and humidity but also shows the wind speeds and what that makes the temperature feel like thanks to the anemometer that can be mounted on their house or a fence post the other thing that we love about this digital weather station is the atomic clock which automatically resets when the time changes so they ll never have to mess with that feature as it is always accurate for the ultra weather nerdy crowd the ambient weather ws-2902a smart wifi weather station features remote monitoring and weather alerts it s the one i have with it
