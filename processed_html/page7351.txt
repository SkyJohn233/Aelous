Former Ole Miss offensive tackle Fahn Cooper celebrates after the Rebels' win against Auburn last year. He was drafted in the fifth round by the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday, his 23rd birthday. (Photo: John Reed, John Reed-USA TODAY Sports) OXFORD - Fahn Cooper started 13 games for Bowling Green as a redshirt freshman in 2012, but the former Ole Miss offensive tackle couldn’t shake the feeling he could achieve more. Some of his fellow students, he said, didn’t even know the team played in a bowl game that year. Cooper gambled on himself, transferring to a junior college in hopes of landing with a high-profile program. He chose to attend Ole Miss, a decision that helped make him a fifth-round pick by the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday, his 23rd birthday. Cooper played all 13 games last season, seven at left tackle and six at right tackle. He also practiced at guard during his two-year career with the Rebels, a sign of his versatility. The importance of an offensive lineman being versatile in the NFL is something Cooper realized last summer when he began looking at how few made NFL rosters. “Going into a game, I’m carrying at least 10 guys into a game whereas an NFL team will have seven or eight,” offensive line coach Matt Luke said. “They have to have several guys who can play multiple positions. I think that’s the number one thing they like about Fahn.” A few days before the draft, Cooper said he’d spoken with the 49ers a lot and that he expected to be taken in either the fourth or fifth round, where most mock draft picks had him going.
