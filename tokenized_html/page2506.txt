during and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request southern tibet is the most active orogenic region on earth where the indian plate thrusts under eurasia pushing the seismic discontinuity between the crust and the mantle to an unusual depth of ~80 x02009 km numerous earthquakes occur in the lower portion of this thickened continental crust but the triggering mechanisms remain enigmatic here we show that dry granulite rocks the dominant constituent of the subducted indian crust become brittle when deformed under conditions corresponding to the eclogite stability field microfractures propagate dynamically producing acoustic emission a laboratory analog of earthquakes leading to macroscopic faults failed specimens are characterized by weak reaction bands consisting of nanometric products of the metamorphic reaction assisted by brittle intra-granular ruptures the reaction bands develop into shear bands which self-organize to form macroscopic riedel-like fault zones these results provide a viable mechanism for deep seismicity with additional constraints on orogenic processes in tibet tibetan plateau the largest mountain range on earth is formed by the collision between indian and eurasian continents since ~50 million years ago resulting in significant deformation in central and eastern asia with a remarkably thickened crust in southern tibet fig x000a0 1 a 1 x02013 3 and pushing the mohorovi x0010d i x00107 seismic discontinuity moho to ~80 x02009 km deep 1 4 x02013 6 the underlying geodynamic process has been under intense debate for decades a central issue being the mechanical nature of subducted indian crust and the underlying upper mantle 3 7 8 earlier seismic studies report bimodal depth distributions of seismicity interpreted as an aseismic and weak lower crust sandwiched between the seismogenic upper crust and the upper mantle 9 contrary to this x0201c jelly sandwich x0201d model the x0201c cr x000e8 me br x000fb l x000e9 e x0201d model argues for strong upper and lower crust overlying a weak upper mantle 10 the two models have drastically different implications in thermal structure mass transfer water storage and melt distribution in the lower crust and upper mantle while the x0201c jelly sandwich x0201d model requires water and/or partial melt enrichment 7 11 suggesting lateral channel flow of materials within the mid-crust to compensate the extra surface load imposed by the himalaya mountain range 12 the x0201c cr x000e8 me br x000fb l x000e9 e x0201d model suggests compensating flows occurring primarily in the upper mantle 13 seismicity is the most direct indicator of mechanical state of earth x02019 s interior most recent studies show that seismicity distribution in southern tibet is more or less continuous from the surface to as deep as 100 x02009 km fig x000a0 1b 14 x02013 17 while the debate on crust and mantle strength continues e.g. see reviews in 11 18 one must address another crucial issue that is how can earthquakes occur in the lower crust and upper mantle which are well below the brittle-ductile transition depth 19 with plastic yield strength of rocks well below that of byerlee x02019 s friction 20 as far as the lower crust is concerned three hypotheses have been proposed the first is a thermal runaway process where a self-amplifying mechanical instability arises from the combination of shear localization and grain-size reduction within a visco-plastic material 21 crucial issue here is the conditions under which shear localizations nucleate and self-amplify leading to failure 22 such conditions are poorly known and just begun to be investigated in the laboratory 23 the second is dehydration embrittlement during which a metamorphic dehydration reaction has the potential to raise pore pressure thereby lowering the effective pressure permitting brittle failure 24 this hypothesis requires sufficient structural water in constituent minerals and is considered a good candidate for seismicity in subducted oceanic low crust 25 26 however xenolith samples from tibet suggest that the indian lower crust lacks hydrous minerals 27 making this mechanism less likely to operate the third is eclogitization-induced instability 28 29 the indian lower crust consists predominantly of granulite-facies rocks 30 31 which become metastable when entering the eclogite-facies stability field through subduction due to the sluggish reaction kinetics within these nominally anhydrous rocks fig x000a0 1c seismic and gravity anomaly data support the existence of eclogite in subducted indian crust 2 32 x02013 35 and eclogite xenoliths have been found in central tibet 36 37 pseudotachylytes usually formed by brittle failure followed by frictional melting during shallow seismicity are found in exhumed deep continental rocks in western norway 38 where dominantly granulite-facies rocks contain eclogite-facies minerals in close association with the pseudotachylytes suggesting that granulite-facies rocks transformed partially at depths greater than 60 x02009 km under conditions corresponding to the eclogite-facies stability field some suggest that deep crustal seismicity under southern tibet may be analogous to that in western norway 29 others however argue that eclogitization involves reconstructive phase transformations in constituent minerals and is unlikely to trigger mechanical instability 24 with the advent of new experimental techniques 39 40 a quantitative investigation is now possible to address the debate on eclogitization-induced instability in the laboratory it has been shown that eclogitization of lawsonite-blueschist a metabasalt abundant in oceanic crust produces mechanical instability 41 here we investigate experimentally the mechanical behavior of dry granulite under various pressure and temperature conditions within both granulite and eclogite stability fields to examine the micromechanics responsible for rupture nucleation and self-organization leading to macroscopic faulting by combining synchrotron x-ray diffraction and imaging for stress and strain measurements with acoustic emission ae monitoring we show that eclogitization of metastable granulite indeed induces mechanical instability due to formation of fine-grained weak reaction bands using advanced seismological tools we locate the ae events and track fracturing process in both space and time such four-dimensional 4-d information along with microstructural analysis on recovered samples after failure provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the mechanism of eclogitization-induced instability for rupture nucleation and propagation in the continental lower crust the starting materials were synthetic granulite by mixing hand-picked natural minerals 65 plagioclase plg 20 quartz qtz and 15 clinopyroxene cpx by weight in molar fractions plg was ~52 albite ab and 48 anorthite an and cpx was ~66 diopside di 22 ferrosilite and 12 wollastonite supplementary table x000a0 1 the mixture was sintered at 2 x02009 gpa and 1273 x02009 k in the stability field of granulite-facies or 3 x02009 gpa and 1073 x02009 k in eclogite-facies field respectively for 6 x02009 h yielding a series of pure granulite denoted by g and partially eclogitized granulite eg samples respectively average grain size was about 20 x02013 50 x02009 x003bc m. the degree of eclogitization in the eg samples was limited to x0003c 10 in volume and the reactions were confined to vicinities adjacent to grain boundaries supplementary fig x000a0 1 average whole-rock water contents were x02009 x0003c x02009 280 ppm supplementary fig x000a0 2 supplementary table x000a0 2 about half those reported as x0201c pre-dried x0201d granulite samples in 42 triaxial deformation experiments were carried out in both a modified griggs apparatus supplementary fig x000a0 3 42 and a deformation-dia d-dia apparatus 40 the latter was interfaced with synchrotron x-ray diffraction and imaging as well as ae monitoring providing vital real-time information critical for investigating faulting mechanism in-situ supplementary figs x000a0 4 x02013 5 samples were deformed under pressure and temperature conditions corresponding to depths up to 90 x02009 km fig x000a0 1c table x000a0 1 the two g samples d1784 and d1995 deformed in the granulite-facies field exhibit ductile behavior with no aes observed this is consistent with previous reports that granulite deforms primarily by dislocation creep under similar conditions 42 43 in contrast all the samples both g and eg types deformed in the eclogite-facies field radiated numerous aes the brittle response is therefore clearly due to eclogitization of metastable granulite figure x000a0 2 summarizes the mechanical behavior of a g sample d1996 deformed at 2.8 x02009 gpa and 1073 x02009 k. deformation began at a differential stress of 0.3 x02009 gpa and axial strain started increasing at ~500 x02009 s. the sample was continuously deformed for 2 x02009 h ending at ~40 strain differential stresses were high with abrupt fluctuations fig x000a0 2a aes began appearing immediately after differential stress started increasing fig x000a0 2b c and ae activities were episodic two broad burst episodes are clearly distinguished separated by a quiet period as will be discussed below the two episodes correspond to the nucleation and growth of two large branches of macroscopic faults the first episode ended with 2 large events fig x000a0 2c which were likely responsible for the large stress fluctuation near ~3600 x02009 s fig x000a0 2a although no clear strain discontinuity was produced the second broad episode began around 5000 x02009 s with higher ae rates the largest burst of ae rate occurred around 6000 x02009 s fig x000a0 2a b associated with a rapid stress drop and a visible discontinuity in the strain-time curve in fig x000a0 2a probably due to macroscopic faulting amplitudes of ae events are typically 10 x02013 30 times greater that the triggered threshold supplementary fig x000a0 6 so relative radiated energies can be estimated based on areas under rectified signal envelope supplementary fig x000a0 7 the steepest cumulative energy release is associated with the second episode ending with macroscopic failure fig x000a0 2c for the eg sample d1787 differential stresses were on the order of 0.4 x02009 gpa fig x000a0 3a fluctuations of differential stress are also associated with strain jumps however uncertainties and poor time resolution ~500 x02009 s in stress measurements do not permit a more detailed examination the sample was continuously shortened for ~1 x02009 h reaching ~25 strain where deformation was intentionally stopped before reaching ultimate failure ae activities also began at very low strains and displayed an episodic behavior the first large ae burst episode began around 1300 x02009 s fig x000a0 3b c causing a discontinuous strain jump probably due to macroscopic faulting fig x000a0 3a another strain jump occurred near 2250 x02009 s shortly before the largest peak of ae rate ae activity decayed rapidly after the termination of deformation mechanical responses of the two eg samples d1736 1738 at 1273 x02009 k are summarized in supplementary fig x000a0 8 ae activity began only when bulk sample strains reached ~10 x02013 15 and at flow stresses ~5 below the peak values ~0.3 x02009 gpa with further increase in strain ae activity increased rapidly flow stress peaked at 15 x02013 20 strain and then decreased deformation was stopped when flow stress dropped to ~2/3 of the critical value both stress and ae activity decayed rapidly due to stress relaxation while strain remained constant within measurement errors indicating that deformation was largely stopped for each pair of triggered events their differential arrival times at each of the six transducers were measured using waveform cross correlation cc and were used to determine their relative location with the double-difference algorithm hypodd 44 45 events were divided into several groups according to waveform similarity defined by correlation coefficients greater than 0.8 all the events were located within the samples that were analyzed spatial distribution of events in two largest groups in d1996 is shown in fig x000a0 4 both groups initiated around the center of the sample but later defined clearly distinguishable planar features representing conjugated faults supplementary movies x000a0 1 and 2 display the two groups of events in both space and time all group 1 events occurred within the first burst episode fig x000a0 2b c earlier events 600 x02013 1800 x02009 s showed no clear preferential distribution in space suggesting an early stage of microrupture nucleation events after 1800 x02009 s began forming a planar distribution indicating the formation of a fault plane supplementary movie x000a0 1 group 2 events in contrast all occurred within the second burst episode and fell into two subgroups in space the first subgroup was located in the center of the sample coinciding with many group 1 events and developed a planar branch after 6600 x02009 s. the second subgroup began forming after 5400 x02009 s and as it grew developed into a better defined planar distribution supplementary movie x000a0 2 one projection is shown in fig x000a0 4b displaying the two fault-like distributions the sample remained intact until ~6000 x02009 s when the large strain discontinuity occurred shortly after the stress drop fig x000a0 2a and failed shortly after in the eg sample d1787 whose deformation was stopped before reaching macroscopic failure one large group group 1 dominated the ae activity with more than 400 events which also show near planar formations supplementary movie x000a0 3 these planar features are less well-defined than those in d1996 scanning electron microscopy sem shows that at mm scale both g and eg samples deformed at 1073 x02009 k display macroscopic faults fig x000a0 5a b while the eg sample deformed at 1273 x02009 k contain no visible large faults fig x000a0 5c figure x000a0 6 compares microstructures of the g d1996 and eg d1787 samples both deformed at 1073 x02009 k. in both cases eclogitization products are observed along grain boundaries and within plg grains fig x000a0 6a c transmission electron microscopy tem selected area electron diffraction saed element mapping using energy-dispersive spectroscopy eds and micro-raman spectroscopy show that the reaction products are omphacite omp kyanite ky and garnet grt fig x000a0 7 supplementary figs x000a0 9 x02013 12 no hydrous minerals such as epidote were detected in the g sample d1996 figs x000a0 6 a b x200b b,7 7 8a b supplementary fig x000a0 10 reaction products appear as continuous thin bands along essentially all boundaries between different minerals within plg grains thin bands are wavy densely spaced and subparallel fig x000a0 6a b within these bands grain sizes are extremely small on the order of 50 x02009 nm fig x000a0 7 supplementary fig x000a0 10 these bands are hereafter referred to as nano-reaction bands nrbs as they consist of the above mentioned reaction products short notch-like openings are often observed along the boundaries of cpx and qtz grains arrows in fig x000a0 6a these x0201c notches x0201d filled with plg or reaction products are likely originated from stress concentration sites due to the x0201c erosion x0201d of the eclogitization reaction at grain boundaries intra-grain shear fractures are ubiquitously observed many cpx and qtz grains are cut through by fractures some of the grains have been completely sheared apart with continuous thin nrbs filling the rupture paths fig x000a0 6 a b x200b b,8a 8a the reaction x0201c notches x0201d appear closely associated with fractures in cpx and qtz grains presumably through stress concentration most of the intra-grain fractures are filled with and connected by nrbs across boundaries of different minerals forming larger-scale fault zones fig x000a0 8a b among the three phases in the granulite samples plg has the lowest melting temperatures 46 and plg melts tend to quench into glasses without dendritic texture 47 no amorphous materials were found down to 5 x02013 10 x02009 nm level that might represent quenched glass neither were there dendritic crystals in or near the nrbs fig x000a0 7a b supplementary fig x000a0 10 the eg sample d1787 with eclogitization more advanced than in g samples also contains macroscopic faults fig x000a0 5b the reaction products form clusters along grain boundaries and within plg grains fig x000a0 6 c d x200b d,8c 8c qtz and cpx grains often have wedge-shaped openings filled with a mixture of plg and reaction products fig x000a0 6d believed of the same origin as the notches observed in d1996 the wider wedge angles may be due to more advanced syn-deformational eclogitiztion thickness of nrbs is greater than that in the g samples with grain sizes up to a few 100 x02009 nm inset of fig x000a0 6c intra-grain ruptures are filled with reaction products fig x000a0 8c larger-scale shear zones are formed by alignment of weakened grain boundaries filled with reaction products fig x000a0 8d again no evidence of melting was found supplementary fig x000a0 12 in contrast to the samples deformed at 1073 x02009 k samples deformed at 1273 x02009 k d1736 d1738 show significant barreling fig x000a0 5c and do not contain faults greater than a few microns in size this observation along with delayed ae activity supplementary fig x000a0 8 suggests that at 1273 x02009 k the samples were close to the ductile regime grain boundaries are dominated by sub- x003bc m sized reaction products which also appear within plg grains supplementary figs x000a0 12 13 wide-spread reaction rims are observed around grain boundaries supplementary fig x000a0 13a some cpx grains have almost completely transformed into grt supplementary fig x000a0 13b ky needles are dispersed in plg grains supplementary fig x000a0 13c at higher magnification very small cavities x000ab 1 x02009 x003bc m are also present along grain boundaries supplementary fig x000a0 13b fractures in large grains some of which may be due to pressure release and cavitation aided grain boundary sliding may be the main cause of observed aes no macroscopic faults are present the initial eclogitization reaction at 1073 x02009 k and 2.5 x02013 2.8 x02009 gpa e.g. sample d1996 under the influence of differential stress may be interpreted as going through primarily the following idealized reactions 46 the ab component in plg reacts with the di component in cpx forming omp plus qtz the an component reacts with di forming a ca and al rich cpx di x02009 x02009 ku plus qtz where ku stands for kushiroite caal 2 sio 6 x000a0 an breaks down to grossular grs and ky plus qtz ab breaks down to jadeite jd and qtz the solid solution of omp and di x02009 x02009 ku is a more general form of omp less rich in na the reaction between plg and di-rich cpx has a positive clapeyron slope 46 because it is highly exothermic and accompanied by a ~10 volume reduction 48 reaction 3 which occurs at pressures ~0.5 x02009 gpa lower than reaction 4 46 takes place within plg grains producing the wavy nrbs wherein reactions 3 and 4 also have positive clapeyron slopes with even greater volume reduction about 20 48 as these reactions proceed under differential stress nrbs tend to propagate in a runaway fashion due to local increase in temperature which enhances transformation kinetics we conducted extensive search for evidence of melting using high-resolution tem hrtem and saed with apertures ~50 x02009 nm no amorphous materials which may be an indicator of quenched melt were found at length scales down to ~10 x02009 nm fig x000a0 7 supplementary fig x000a0 12 for d1996 p x02009 x02009 2.8 x02009 gpa the melting point t m of plg is about 1673 k 49 based on the offsets of sheared grains e.g. fig x000a0 6a b we may estimate the upper bound for the frictional coefficient x003bc of the nrbs according to δ t μ σ n d pc h where x00394 t x02009 x02009 t m x02212 t x02009 x02248 x02009 600 x02009 k x003c3 n the normal stress p d the x0201c coseismic x0201d slip distance ~20 x02009 x003bc m x003c1 c is the specific heat capacity ~2.5 x02009 mpa x02009 k x02212 1 and h the thickness ~1 x02009 x003bc m of the nrbs 50 according to this relation which assumes that coulomb friction law applies at depths and shear-induced heating is adiabatic x003bc is x0003c 0.03 for such low friction coefficient the nrbs are almost fluid-like in eg samples the reaction products are predominantly grt ky and qz following reaction 3 the cpx component in granulite further reacts with the above reaction products forming a grt phase that contains pyrope pyr and almandine alm in addition to 40 x02013 50 x02009 mol grs grain sizes of these phases are slightly larger than those in g samples supplementary fig x000a0 12b the reduction in flow stress in this sample is attributed to pronounced grain boundary weakening due to the formation of ultrafine-grained reaction products analogous to that observed in 51 large faults in eg samples are formed predominantly by thickening and coalescing fine-grained reaction bands which then connect across grains of different minerals forming macroscopic shear bands fig x000a0 8d our 4-d event tracking shows that failure nucleated inside the samples and propagated outward fig x000a0 4 and supplementary movies x000a0 1 x02013 3 microstructural observations on samples with various deformation histories allow construction of the following model of mechanical instability during syn-deformational eclogitization fig x000a0 9 an initial granulite microstructure supplementary fig x000a0 5a is schematically illustrated in fig x000a0 9a as the rock is deformed in the eclogite stability field reactions 1 and 2 occur along plg-cpx interfaces red dotted lines in fig x000a0 9b reaction 3 occurs within plg grains white dotted lines and also along the plg-qtz interfaces black dotted lines presumably due to stress concentration these reactions produce nrbs consisting of ultrafine-grained products and perhaps minute cavities dotted lines latent heat produced by the reactions raises temperature locally further enhancing rates of reactions the combined effects result in a transient loss of shear strength along mineral interfaces and in plg grains as the reactions proceed mineral interfaces are further x0201c eroded x0201d producing more stress concentration sites at cpx and qtz grain boundaries where microfractures initiate schematically shown as thin red lines in fig x000a0 9b nrbs within plg grains and along mineral interfaces become shear bands within which shear deformation is concentrated the reaction products being ultrafine-grained and fluid-like fill in microfractures and grain boundaries intra-grain shear bands and microfractures propagate across individual grains fig x000a0 9c producing ae events whose magnitudes are primarily controlled by the dimensions of the grains these microfractures form en- x000e9 chelon -like configurations which are the nuclei of riedel-like shears in the synthetic sense 52 as deformation continues intra-granular fractures connect across x0201c lubricated x0201d grain boundaries and interfaces forming larger fault zones fig x000a0 9d thick black lines figure x000a0 9 only shows growth of fault zones in one general direction the same argument applies to the conjugated directions the fault zones are frictional shear in nature and with increasing deformation produce antithetic and other accessory riedel shears as required by geometric and stress/strain compatibility 52 the sub-mm scaled riedel-like shears fig x000a0 8b exhibit similar characteristic of fault zones to those observed in larger laboratory test specimens and in the field from cm to km scales 52 suggesting that once the length of riedel shear zones grows to greater than several tens of grain diameters mineralic heteorogeneity becomes less important and mechanical behavior is controlled by the properties of the average continuum abundant hydrous mineral epidote was found in pseudotachylites from bergen arcs norway suggesting significant amounts of hydrous fluids were present during the formation of pseudotachylites 53 which are considered indicators of shear-induced melting 38 in our samples the small amount of structural water x0003c 280 x02009 ppm was insufficient to stabilize epidote furthermore our microstructure observations suggest that shear instability does not necessarily induce melting in fact there is growing evidence from both field and laboratory that fine-grained reaction products can significantly affect mechanical behavior of deforming rocks 54 resulting in reaction softening 55 or transformational faulting 56 in the solid state dry granulite is another example where mechanical instability is due primarily to grain-size reduction seismic moment magnitudes of the aes exhibit a very narrow distribution figs x000a0 2 b x200b b,3b 3b this is consistent with grain-size controlled microfracturing observed in the microstructure such narrow magnitude distribution however prevents a meaningful gutenberg-richter statistics analysis and b -values can not be reliably evaluated in contrast the large sudden jump in strain around 6000 x02009 s fig x000a0 2a corresponding to a ~0.1 x02009 mm instantaneous sample shortening strongly suggests formation of macroscopic faults and is consistent with the long and complex riedel shears observed in the microstructure fig x000a0 5a therefore large events responsible for riedel shears may have characteristic frequencies outside of the detectability of the narrow band transducers used in this study future development of broadband transducers is required to examine scalability issues based on b -values both mechanical and microstructural observations indicate that granulite-facies rocks at the onset of eclogitization are seimogenic at our laboratory strain rate c. 10 x02013 5 x02009 s x02212 1 the temperature at the onset of eclogitization is ~1073 x02009 k. under such temperatures granulite deforms by power law creep within its own stability field 42 43 thermokinematic modeling suggests that eclogitization of the metastable indian lower crust begins at temperatures ~873 x000b1 100 k 57 based on p -wave velocity anomalies it has been argued that below ~60 x02009 km the lower crust may have reached roughly 30 eclogitization 32 assuming a homogeneous mixture of granulite- and eclogite-facies minerals actual degrees of eclogitization depend on temperature age and volatiles and therefore vary within the subducted crust 2 57 extrapolating the granulite flow law to 10 x02212 16 x02009 s x02212 1 a representative strain rate in subducted indian lower crust 58 and 873 x02009 k yields flow stresses on the order of 2 x02013 4 x02009 mpa in good agreement with strength models for continental crust and lithosphere 11 as well as bouguer gravity and topography data which infer a long-term effective elastic thickness of 70 x02013 120 x02009 km for this region 59 the ~4 x02009 mpa crustal strength also provide a broad constraint on earthquake stress drops which are of similar magnitudes in southern tibet 60 our results provide a viable micro-mechanism for rupture nucleation and propagation for observed lower-crustal seismicity in southern tibet however mechanisms for the seismicity below the moho remain unresolved the unusually large effective elastic thickness of lithosphere indicates that the uppermost mantle must be rigid enough to contribute significantly to the long-term integrated strength of the lithosphere 59 a recent study shows that at pressures corresponding to depths up to 100 x02009 km shear-banding and localized heating may develop in deforming olivine resulting in seismogenic faulting 23 we note that sub-moho earthquakes in southern tibet tend to be clustered in close proximity to events in the lower crust fig x000a0 1b such sub-moho seismicity may be interpreted as shear localization induced instability triggered by stress heterogeneities produced through strong mechanical coupling between the crust and upper mantle deformation experiments were conducted in a modified griggs apparatus 42 with conventional continuous stress and strain measurement at state key laboratory of geological processes and mining resources cug wuhan and in a d-dia apparatus with in-situ ae and x-ray monitoring 39 40 at beamline 13-bm-d of the gsecars facilities at the advanced photon source argonne national laboratory the cell assembly used in the griggs apparatus is shown in supplementary fig x000a0 3 the overall d-dia setup is schematically shown in fig s4 the d-dia employs six anvils four of which are made of tungsten carbide wc and two made of sintered diamonds which are transparent to x-rays allowing complete diffraction debye rings of the samples to be recorded on the area detector cell assembly used in the d-dia experiments supplementary fig x000a0 5 is identical to that reported in ref 39 deformation was achieved by advancing the two differential rams shortening the sample along the vertical cylindrical axis since the differential rams can be adjusted independently from the main hydraulic ram differential stress and sample axial strain can be controlled essentially independently from hydrostatic pressure pressure and temperature conditions corresponded to the stability fields of both granulite and eclogite-facies table x000a0 1 for each experiment hydrostatic pressure was first applied to the sample and maintained at a desired value the x0201c confining pressure x0201d and then the sample was heated to a targeted temperature deformation was carried out after annealing at the target temperature for 1 x02009 h to minimize effects of cold compression and possible water absorption during cell preparation the incident x-ray beam was collimated to 200 x02009 x000d7 x02009 200 x003bc m by wc slits a rayonix sx-165 two-dimensional 2d detector was used for x-ray diffraction xrd with monochromatic radiation at 60 x02009 kev wavelength x003bb x02009 x02009 0.2755 x02009 x000c5 typical diffraction data collection time was 300 x02009 s. detector orientation relative to the incident beam was calibrated using a ceo 2 powder standard with the data collection and analysis software dioptas 61 stress analysis was carried out on 2d xrd patterns using the multifit-polydefix software developed by s. merkel http //merkel.zoneo.net/multifit/ possible detector center drift was systematically corrected during the stress analysis by adjustment of the diffraction ring center in multifit-polydefix sample axial strains were measured using radiography with a large beam 2.0 x02009 x000d7 x02009 3.5 x02009 mm by opening up the wc slits gold foils were placed on top and bottom of the sample as strain markers each radiograph was acquired for 8 x02009 s using a ce-doped yag scintillator and a pointgrey charge-coupled device ccd 1.3 x02009 x003bc m/pixel sample bulk axial strain was defined as positive under shortening x003b5 x02009 x02009 x00394 l l where l is the sample length the reference l r in x00394 l x02009 x02009 l r x02212 l was taken just before starting the deformation in each run under pressure and temperature typical uncertainty in strain measurement was on the order of 0.2 throughout a given deformation cycle diffraction and imaging data were collected alternatively by switching the diffraction/imaging optics the process was automated with minimal human intervention the total time required for a pair of strain and stress measurements was about 8 x02009 min which is the time resolution in real-time faulting detection the ae setup supplementary fig x000a0 4 is similar to that reported in 39 six piezoelectric lead-zirconium-titanate pzt transducers 10 x02009 mm diameter 0.5 x02009 mm thickness each positioned on the back end of an anvil were used to monitor aes arising from the sample resonant frequencies of the transducers were 2 x02013 3 x02009 mhz the back end of the anvils was mirror-polished to create a perfectly planar interface for electrical insulation each sensor was glued onto a 0.25 x02009 mm thick al 2 o 3 disk six amplifiers filtered analogically 0.3 x02013 5 x02009 mhz were used to amplify the acoustic signals at 60 x02009 db two types of acoustic data were acquired continuous waveforms were recorded at 10 x02009 mhz sampling frequency using a mini-richter streamer itasca consulting group ltd. during both cold compression and heating cycles this type of data records events at all magnitude levels however the amount of data is large a continuous recording for 20 x02009 min leads to ~50 gb of data in order to increase streaming duration over the course of an experiment only one channel was used for continuous recording independently from the continuous mode ae waveforms were acquired simultaneously in triggered mode from all six transducers each using a digital multi-channel oscilloscope when the signal was higher than a prescribed trigger level typically 150 x02009 mv on a given channel the waveform was recorded typical triggered waveforms contained 2000 x02013 8000 points at a sampling rate of 50 x02009 mhz supplementary fig x000a0 6 shows an example of ae waveforms recorded green and red ticks mark the first arrival peak for each channel note that due to faster wave speeds in diamond arrivals on the two sd anvils are significantly earlier than in the other four wc anvils to calibrate travel times through the anvils a 500-v pulse was sent from one sensor with p -wave signals recorded by the opposing transducer travel times along the three pairs of anvils were then used to build a velocity model which is necessary to locate the aes using differences in arrival times travel times within wc anvils were assumed to be equal travel times within sd anvils were about 1 x02009 x000b5 s faster than that in the wc anvils the ae arrival time differences obtained on each sensor once corrected for anvil travel times were interpreted as travel-time difference within the assembly under hydrostatic stress the inter-planar spacing d -spacing for a given set of lattice planes hkl in a random powdered sample undergoes identical elastic deformation lattice strain regardless of azimuth angle on an area detector resulting in perfectly circular diffraction debye rings under a macroscopic differential stress the lattice strain is a function of orientation of the diffracting planes relative to the stress geometry resulting in pseudo-elliptical debye rings the pseudo-ellipticity of powder diffraction rings is a linear elastic function proxy for the differential stress the polycrystalline sample supports the diffracting plane azimuth x003c6 is defined as the angle between the maximum compression axis and the diffracting plane normal x003c6 x02009 x02009 0 x000b0 corresponds to planes whose normal is parallel to the maximum compression axis each xrd pattern was integrated over 5 x000b0 slices of azimuthal angle resulting in 72 chi files 2 x003b8 v. x000a0 intensity spectra using macros in fit2d 62 at any azimuth angle x003c6 simple elastic theory assuming no lattice preferred orientation no plastic relaxation of stress and under an axial-symmetric stress field predicts the relation between measured d-spacing d hkl and lattice strain q hkl to be 63 where d p hkl is the d-spacing under isotropic stress i.e. hydrostatic pressure for each plane hkl d hkl and x003c6 are measured from the xrd pattern cos x003c6 x02009 x02009 cos x003b8 cos x003b7 where x003b7 is apparent azimuth angle on the detector and x003b8 the diffraction angle q hkl and d p hkl are extracted by fitting d hkl vs. x003c6 according to s1 differential stresses t hkl were calculated for planes from lattice strains q hkl according to the x0201c effective moduli x0201d g hkl were calculated with elastic compliances s ij from inversion of the stiffness tensor c ij for qtz from 64 with experimentally determined pressure 65 and temperature derivatives 64 we used the reuss iso-stress assumption to calculate differential stress for each hkl believed to be closer to reality than the voigt iso-strain assumption 54 the flow stress quoted in this work is the unweighted average of differential stresses t hkl calculated from the lattice strains of qtz 110 and 101 this approach may be biased by the availability of diffraction lines and has no physical ground however it is used in many studies because there is still no complete theory for evaluation of macroscopic stress from powder diffraction data an additional complexity in our experiments is that the samples contain multiple phases each having a finite strength resulting in potentially significant stress heterogeneities the qtz peaks used may sense macroscopic stresses differently in different samples at various stages of deformation recognizing these complications the stress values thus obtained are considered an indicator of the relative differential stress levels experienced by the material i.e. stress drops and increases are more reliable than absolute values with absolute errors as large as 10 x02013 20 unit-cell volumes of qtz were calculated using the two crystallographic planes of 110 and 101 near the x0201c magic angle x0201d cos 2 x003c6 x02009 x02009 1/3 see equation s1 confining pressures were calculated following the third-order high-temperature birch-murnaghan equation of state 66 with 1 x02009 atm thermal expansion data for qtz 67 and pressure and temperature derivatives of the bulk modulus from 64 and 65 respectively estimated uncertainties in pressure was about 0.2 x02009 gpa ae events were relocated using the well-developed seismological algorithm hypodd 44 we first cross correlated waveforms between events for each channel using a time window of 6 x02009 x003bc s wide starting 1 x02009 x003bc s before the first p -wave arrival the cc results were visually inspected for all six channels cc coefficients greater than 0.8 could identify similar waveforms and align them correctly differential arrival times of event pairs measured by the waveform cc were then used in the hypodd algorithm to relocate the ae events the hypodd algorithm determines relative location and origin time between any two events in the analysis p -wave velocity of granulite 6.36 x02009 km/s 68 was used as the amount of eclogite was less than 10 x02009 vol according to sem for each pair of events differential p -wave arrival times of at least four channels were needed to avoid the situation where all four channels were located in a plane which would lead to a trade-off between the origin time and relative location in the direction perpendicular to the plane we required differential p -wave arrival times of at least five channels for the pair for each experiment events recorded could not be located in one group to satisfy the above requirements the algorithm divided events in groups of various sizes and determined relative locations of events within each group triggered ae records were first harvested as discrete events the relative elastic energy emitted is directly proportional to the area under a given ae waveform 69 in the present study it was measured as the area under rectified signal envelope marse x02013 supplementary fig x000a0 7 69 although this measure does not give absolute energy values radiated by the ae events it provides useful information on relative energy release in addition to the length scale difference laboratory experiments must be conducted at much higher strain rates than geological processes for obvious reasons and as a result require much greater differential stresses laboratory studies show that granulite deformation follows the power law creep where ε ˙ is strain rate a is a material constant x003c3 the flow stress n the stress exponent q the activation energy t the temperature in k and r the gas constant for mafic granulite 42 n x02009 x02009 3.2 q x02009 x02009 244 35 kj/mol and for felsic granulite 43 the corresponding parameters are no reported uncertainties 3.1 and 243 x02009 kj/mol respectively our experiments show that faulting occurs only in samples with a small degree of eclogitization hence flow properties of such samples are similar to those of pure granulite assuming that the subducted indian lower crust deforms by the same granulite power law mechanism the required strain rate and flow stress may be estimated from laboratory data using 7 to yield where subscripts 1 and 2 are parameters for field and laboratory deformation respectively strain rates ε ˙ 1 in the subducted indian plate are on the order of 10 x02212 16 s x02212 1 58 slab thermokinematical modeling 57 suggests that at such strain rates eclogitization of metastable granulite rocks begins around t 1 x02009 x02009 873 x02009 k. our experiments at strain rate ε ˙ 2 x02009 10 x02212 5 x02009 s x02212 1 show that eclogitization at t 2 x02009 x02009 1073 x02009 k is seismogenic and that by 1273 x02009 k the samples begin losing strength and become ductile the flow stress x003c3 2 at t 2 is ~1.5 x02009 gpa because of the large uncertainties in q determinations we use a range q x02009 x02009 200 x02013 300 x02009 kj/mol to examine effects of strain rate stress and temperature with the above parameters we obtain from 8 flow stresses of granulite at 873 x02009 k and 10 x02212 16 x02009 s x02212 1 to be x003c3 2 x02009 x02009 1.8 x02009 mpa for q x02009 x02009 200 x02009 kj/mol and x003c3 2 x02009 x02009 4.2 x02009 mpa for q x02009 x02009 300 x02009 kj/mol these stress levels if completely released through seismicity are in excellent agreement with stress drops for earthquakes with normal and reverse faulting focal mechanisms 60 high-resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem and electron energy loss spectroscopy eels were
