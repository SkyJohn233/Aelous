absorption of the gamma photons geant4 simulation can be utilized for estimation of mass energy-absorption coefficients in elements and composite materials the most important quantity characterizing the radiation interacting in extended media is the absorbed dose which represents the energy transferred to the matter the dose quantity is one of the important parameter for radiation protection dose measurement radiation effect and defects in the material the dose delivered to a medium is measured in terms of mass energy-absorption coefficient µ en ρ which is a an essential quantity used in medical physics radiation physics health physics radiation biology radiotherapy irradiation technology and other practical applications it is not possible to calculate µ en ρ directly but it is necessary to use mass energy-transfer coefficient µ tr ρ the amount of photon energy transferred is dependent upon interaction process namely the photoelectric effect compton scattering and pair production these interaction processes are dependent upon atomic numbers of the elements of compound/mixture and photon energy mass energy-absorption coefficient indirectly mass energy-transfer coefficeint is a measure of average fraction of photon energy transferred to kinetic energy of the charged particle when photon interacts with a material photoelectric absorption incoherent scattering and pair/triplet production exhibit these characterisitics whereas coherent scattering transfers negligible photon energy these events are playing a crucial role in the calculation of energy-absorption coefficients hubbell 1969 hubbell 1977 the intreraction of gamma photon with the matter is a complex process where different types of events are occuring in the medium it is found that there are various factors average fraction of kinetic energy of secondary photon incident photon energy additive law for mixture etc affecting the calculation of the energy absorption various

2012 the theoretical method for calculation of the mass energy-absoprtion coefficeint is a complicated process the experimetal values of the mass energy-absoprtion coefficeints are found for some compounds for very limited energies after review of the literature it has been found that this area requires investigation for finding easy ways of estimation of the mass energy-absoprtion coefficeints this encouraged us to utilize geant4 monte carlo simulation method for calculation of the mass energy-absoprtion coefficeints therefore this present work aims to calculate the mass energy-absoprtion coefficeints of elements carbon nitrogen silicon air sodium iodide and some nuclear track detectors the geant4 simulation results of elements and sodium iodide were found to be in very good agreement with earlier literature data first of all the geant4 code simulated results of mass energy-absorption coefficients of elements air and sodium iodide were validated with available literature data for photon energy 0.4–10 mev and then geant4 was utilized for simulation for photon energy 1 kev –20 mev geant4 simulation was utilized for calculation of mass energy-absoprtion coefficeints for some nuclear track detectors the air kerma and energy absorption buildup factors were also analyzed for the nuclear track detectors geant4 monte carlo simulation was used for first time for calculation of the mass energy-absoprtion coefficeints at present geant4 monte carlo simulation has been used for mass attenuation coefficients of composite materials and standarized the

2007 the geant4 simulation toolkit covers a wide energy range starting from 250 ev to tev the geant4 simulation is the modeling of the photon interaction through materials in computer environment which gives flexibility and ease of use instead of performing an experimental determination of mass energy-attenuation coefficient of different composite materials mass energy-attenuation of photons is calculated by simulating all relevant physical processes and interactions before and after inserting the materials under investigation medhat and wang 2013 the kinetic energy per unit mass kerma

mfp and k e x is the dose multiplicative factor the variation of k e x with penetration represents the change in the shape of the spectrum from that at 1 mfp which determines the value of b the mass energy-absorption coefficients computed using geant4 simulation for carbon nitrogen and silicon elements and sodium iodide are given in table 1 a and b the variation of mass energy-absorption

table 1 a b it was found that the geant4 simulation results for the selected elements carbon nitrogen and silicon and sodium iodide are in very good agreement with the earlier reported data in the literatures the variation of μ en ρ values of the nuclear track detectors and air is shown in fig 1 fig 2 using geant4 simulation and theoretical hubbell and seltzer 1995 respectively fig 1 fig 2 show that the geant4 simulation provides the results similar to the theoretical calculation by hubbell and seltzer 1995 the μ en ρ values of medical biological tissue substitutes and composite materials can also be simulated using the present standard geant4 code the geant4 code produces μ en ρ values of the elements mixtures and compounds in very good agreement with earlier reported data by solving experimental and theoretical complications using geant4 code simulation for μ en ρ results the variation of kerma of the nuclear track detectors relative to air with photon energy 1 kev–20 mev is shown in fig 3 in general the kerma values of all the nuclear track detectors are in range of unity above 100 kev photon energy i.e beyond photoelectric effect however there is a variation in kerma for composites containing slightly high-z elements quartz and soda lime the reason for such variation in kerma is due to large photon energy transfer for high-z elements as the photoelectric cross section is proportional to z 4–5 similar behaviors are observed for alcohols and tissue substitutes singh and badiger 2013 singh et al. 2014b it is easy to calculate the kerma relative to air using

penetration depths 0.5 1 5 and 10 mfps are given in table 2 .the energy absorption buildup factors of the nuclear track detectors are small for low-penetration depth whereas it is found bigger for large-penetration depths in the present paper the mass energy-absorption coefficients of carbon nitrogen silicon air sodium iodide and some nuclear track detectors were calculated using geant4 simulation code there was a very good agreement between geant4 simulation code with the data tables published earlier rosemary 1961 hubbell and berger 1968 hubbell 1982 higgins et al. 1992 oz et al. 2006 hubbell and seltzer 1995 gurler et al. 2009 the present simulation code should be considered as a standard for calculation of mass energy-absorption coefficients for any elements and
