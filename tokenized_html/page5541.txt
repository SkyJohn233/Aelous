cgtalk delete one operation from history hey there ist there a way to delete a single or multiple operations from the history stack of an object like in 3d studio max you d be able delete a singel modifyer from the stack is ther such a thing in maya i know that it is possible to delete the complete history edit/delete bz type/ delete history but that s not what i m looking for you can select the input name in the channel box and then go to edit delete node in the channel box menu since selecting those inputs is a bit finicky sometimes try more than once if at first you don t succeed just a note that deleting a node is not like deleting historyâ€¦as in it doesn t bake the node s operation good luck a note deleting a node midstream is seldomly a good idea especially when that node modifies an object s topology speficially component ids and hence affects the operation of other nodes downstream that being said i often find the need to quickly delete a node usually from the top of the stream so i have the following command mapped to ctrl+end does exactly what animatedfox described thx a lot both ways work just fine i am aware that it s not the best way to delete nodes but i ran out of undos and wanted to get rid of the last couple of operations so your replies were very helpful well if it s multiple nodes you want to delete then simply use the connections hypergraph news to me i didn t realize it could be done that way thanks thx a lot both ways work just fine i am aware that it s not the best way to delete nodes but i ran out of undos and wanted to get rid of the last couple of operations so your replies were very helpful you can set your amount of undos to infinite in your preferences to avoid that problem in the future i actually have my undos set to infinitive but they re not actually infinite are they i actually have my undos set to infinitive but they re not actually infinite are they strictly speaking no they re not infinite the number of undo s is limited by the amount of ram or depending on how the undo system is implemented available drive space but honestly as far as reality is concerned you might as well have infinity because you d have to have been working on a huge loooong session to actually reach that threshold on today s system i d wager this thread has been automatically closed as it remained inactive for 12 months if you wish to continue the discussion please create a new thread in the appropriate forum powered by discourse best viewed with javascript enabled
