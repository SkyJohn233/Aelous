Zeiter resides in Bern but says his heart belongs to Argentina. He has just one word for his Main Event deep run:  " Vamos! "  Done with school duties, the 29-year-old can now fully focus on poker again. Zeiter is a long-time poker pro, who picked up the game back in 2007. He's accumulated nearly $600K in live tournaments so far. Zeiter's biggest payday was $113,819 for sixth place in a $1,500 NLH Event at 2013 World Series of Poker. Zeiter has already captured a trophy at PokerStars sponsored events. He won the EPT13 Prague €2k Turbo Knockout for €25,700. However, Zeiter's bread and butter are online tournaments. His stellar CV includes several six-figure cashes on PokerStars. When he's not present at live or online poker tables, Zeiter can be often found on a football pitch, slopes and a tennis court.
