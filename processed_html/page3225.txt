Milestones: 1945–1952 - Office of the Historian George F.                        Kennan , a career Foreign Service Officer, formulated the policy of                    “containment,” the basic United States strategy for fighting the cold war                    (1947–1989) with the Soviet Union. Kennan’s ideas, which became the basis of the Truman administration’s foreign                    policy, first came to public attention in 1947 in the form of an anonymous                    contribution to the journal  Foreign Affairs , the                    so-called “X-Article.” “The main element of any United States policy toward the                    Soviet Union,” Kennan wrote, “must be that of a long-term, patient but firm and                    vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies.” To that end, he called                    for countering “Soviet pressure against the free institutions of the Western                    world” through the “adroit and vigilant application of counter-force at a series                    of constantly shifting geographical and political points, corresponding to the                    shifts and maneuvers of Soviet policy.” Such a policy, Kennan predicted, would                    “promote tendencies which must eventually find their outlet in either the                    break-up or the gradual mellowing of Soviet power.” Kennan’s policy was controversial from the very beginning. Columnist                         Walter Lippmann  attacked the X-Article for failing to                    differentiate between vital and peripheral interests. The United States,                    Kennan’s article implied, should face down the Soviet Union and its Communist                    allies whenever and wherever they posed a risk of gaining influence. In fact,                    Kennan advocated defending above all else the world’s major centers of                    industrial power against Soviet expansion: Western Europe, Japan, and the United                    States. Others criticized Kennan’s policy for being too defensive. Most notably,                         John Foster                        Dulles  declared during the 1952 election campaign that the United                    States’ policy should not be containment, but the “rollback” of Soviet power and                    the eventual “liberation” of Eastern Europe. Even within the Truman                    administration there was a rift over containment between Kennan and  Paul Nitze ,                    Kennan’s successor as director of the Policy Planning Staff. Nitze, who saw the                    Soviet threat primarily in military terms, interpreted Kennan’s call for “the                    adroit and vigilant application of counter-force” to mean the use of military                    power. In contrast, Kennan, who considered the Soviet threat to be primarily                    political, advocated above all else economic assistance (e.g., the Marshall                    Plan) and “psychological warfare” (overt propaganda and covert operations) to                    counter the spread of Soviet influence. In 1950, Nitze’s conception of                    containment won out over Kennan’s. NSC 68, a policy document prepared by the                    National Security Council and signed by Truman, called for a drastic expansion                    of the U.S. military budget. The paper also expanded containment’s scope beyond                    the defense of major centers of industrial power to encompass the entire world.                    “In the context of the present polarization of power,” it read, “a defeat of                    free institutions anywhere is a defeat everywhere.” Despite all the criticisms and the various policy defeats that Kennan suffered in                    the early 1950’s, containment in the more general sense of blocking the                    expansion of Soviet influence remained the basic strategy of the United States                    throughout the cold war. On the one hand, the United States did not withdraw                    into isolationism; on the other, it did not move to “roll back” Soviet power, as                    John Foster Dulles briefly advocated. It is possible to say that each succeeding                    administration after Truman’s, until the collapse of communism in 1989, adopted                    a variation of Kennan’s containment policy and made it their own. history@state.gov Phone: 202-955-0200 Fax: 202-955-0268
