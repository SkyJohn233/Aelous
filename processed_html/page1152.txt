diazepam removed brain fog/head pressure for 10 days and then? - Treatment Options - Depersonalization Community Jump to content You currently have javascript disabled.

Regular Contributor Posted  03 September 2015 - 06:30 AM I used diazepam again for 14 days/5 mg a day and it cleared the brain fog and the head pressure completely. I saw the light for a week! It was amazing. However, once stopped, the problems came back more severely! Valium is known to be depressive too. So, I felt very down for a week. Is not there any medication outside the benzodiazepine group that works as quickly and as effectively as diazepam ? Senior DPSelfhelp.com Member Posted  03 September 2015 - 06:56 AM Clonazepam seems to be more suitable for long-term usage, which may be required if you want your problems to be gone for good. Alternatives might be medications which increase GABA in the brain rather than agonizing the receptor like benzodiazepines. Many anticonvulsives do this.

Can you name a few of these medications that increase GABA in the brain please? Cheers!

Coming from 8 years of personal experience on Klonopin, I highly advise to not take these long term, they all have a plateau effect and you could end up being more anxious then you are right now. These drugs are meant as a PRN, completely as needed. There are other medications made for long term use that are more suitable. Granted these benzos work great at first, but the price to pay once you hit that plateau is far too high.

I totally agree with you but what are these medications for long term use? Senior DPSelfhelp.com Member Posted  03 September 2015 - 02:29 PM As far as I know on this forum are some people (Dreamer, comfortably numb) who use Clonazepam long-term to improve their depersonalization. But one should definetely think twice before using it long-term, because you won't get away from it easily. At my stay in the psychiatric clinic I met a patient who quit Lorazepam. He wasn't able to sleep for 10 days. Posted  04 September 2015 - 12:09 AM Dreamer has been using klonopin 6mg for a long time, for her it has worked, comfortably numb hasn't been heard from, at least by me, since 2007ish. It did help me for many years but the dosage always needs an increase if not balanced properly. I'm not excited to come off but I know it's what needs to happen, there's no point being on a medicine that doesn't work. 0 members, 0 guests, 0 anonymous users Community Forum Software by IP.Board
