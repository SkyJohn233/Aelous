Venn Diagram : matlab Hi guys . I would like to know if my code calculation is correct and how to adjust the Venn diagram for the program ( bayes Theorem ) Note : The Venn Diagram has to modify depending on the input no  comments  yet Be the first to share what you think! " Well use something like find(vector!=value_you_don &# x27;t_want) " Except in this case we don &# x27;t have the values we don &# x27;t want. We have the indices we don &# x27;t want. >< p> Attempt: indices_do_not_want=[1 2 3] vector=[ 10 20 30 40 50 60 ] % so I want to get a vector containing 40 50 60 vector(ind~=indices_want) But then I realized I don &# x27;t have a way to tell the vector that I &# x27;m looking at the indices (ind), do I? What might you try? >< p> Right now, my way to deal with this is looping through the whole vector and assembling a new one, but I was curious if there is a more compact, Matlab-esque way to do it? More and more MATLAB users are using automation servers as part of continuous integration workflows. A popular option is  Jenkins . Back in April, MathWorks released the  Jenkins MATLAB Plugin  to enable users to run tests using the  MATLAB Unit Test  framework for both MATLAB and Simulink-based workflows. The team just released v1.1.0 of the plugin on Friday, which adds support for Simulink Test artifact generation (coverage results and test results) and Jenkins remote agent support. The plugin is updated outside of the regular semi-annual release cycle. If you &# x27;re unfamiliar with Jenkins, check out the  Jenkins tutorial . (You should become familiar with Jenkins - it will serve you well) I have a curve created from data measured in a tensile test and I also have a linear function. I would like to know how to get the coordinates of their intersection. Most answers that I &# x27;ve seen online consider 2 functions, but in my case I have a plot and a function. Thank you Hey all, I’m a freshman in college and one of our class projects is to create a game using App Designer in Matlab. I’m trying to make hangman, but I’m struggling with actually displaying the blank spaces on the screen and displaying correct letters in their right spaces when the button of the letter is pushed. Anyone have any experience with making hangman and could give me some tips? Hi, I have a powerful workstation at home. It runs the linux version of matlab & simulink. Is it possible to connect an ultraportable to it and run matlab & simulink on it as if it were run locally with GUI running smoothly on the laptop? What do I need and what is the recommended hardware requirements of the laptop? Is 16GB, Intel iGPU sufficient? It ' s hard to send uploads of files here so hopefully this screenshot should be enough to get started. We are asked to generate separate Markov chains to not only randomly adapt the notes played, but also randomly adapt their durations, intensities, and/or attenuations. The ranges for each as follows: param.durationSet = [1:5] param.intensitySet =  [0:100] param.attenuationSet = [25:75] The screenshot shown below shows the code for a song played using a Markov chain that randomly adapts the notes played using a random function generator  ' rando.m ' . So, I ' ve tried playing around with using the rando function in the script for those variables, but I ' m not sure if it ' s as simple as that cause I know we would have to set a new variable as shown with the Markov chain for randomly playing adapted notes. I don ' t want to screw anything again with it because I ' ve had some problems with working directory before while I was trying to implement this and I don ' t want to cause a bigger mess again. If anyone can help me with guiding me in the right direction, I ' d really appreciate that! I have a question where inside it, states:   " You will obtain the predicted labels for the test set "  . What exactly are predicted labels? Just the predicted Y values when I have created a decision tree. Im using the  ' fitctree '  function to train a decision tree, then testing it on my test data set, thanks I am trying to download some videos off a database on the web and there ' s quite a bit so instead of going through each link and downloading them manually I wanted to create a matlab script to just go through the link one by one (basically think video1 video2 video3) so all I had to do was increment the link by 1 to get to the next video. the problem, however, is that some numbers say video24 doesn ' t have a video and a 404 error pops up, well when that happens the script just states the error and doesn ' t continue. is there anyway to ignore the error or get the script to acknowledge the error and then continue to increment until the next link with a file to download? I can ' t think of anything and searching the web resulted in a try and catch command that basically just keeps the error from appearing, but doesn ' t keep the script from stopping when it hits a 404 error. Edit: nevermind, I figured out my problem, I should have been using the  " try "  and  " Catch "  command inside my for loop and not have the for loop inside of the try and catch commands. Hello! I have some code from R that I want to use in Matlab, but I don’t know how to convert it to Matlab. This is the code: y  < - rnorm(n=mySample, mean=5) h  < - dnorm(y, mean=0)/dnorm(y, mean=5) * I(y > 5) Thank you in advance! 27.1k coders 56 logged in Aug 15, 2009 Cake Day
