How many H atoms arev in 0.100 mole of ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4? | Yahoo Answers 0.800 mole of H atoms This is because there are 8 moles of H atoms in one mole of (NH4)2SO4 formula units. Or, expressed another way, 8 H atoms in every formula unit of (NH4)2SO4. Edit: Oops, forgot this step: 0.800 mol times 6.022 x 10^23 atms / mol = 4.82 x 10^23 atoms (to three sig figs) It &# x27;s simple, like the person above me showed.     There are 8 H atoms in one molecule of ammonium sulfate. NH4 has four obviously, and since there are two units, so to speak, of NH4 you get 8 H atoms. 0.100 mole of ammonium sulfate will have 8 times that of H. So you will have 0.800 mole of H atoms.

(NH4)2S is ammonium sulphide. It includes 2 moles of NH4^+ ions. The formula represents one mole of (NH4)2S Please verify your answer.
