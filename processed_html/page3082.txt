An X-Ray Study of the p-n-Alkoxybenzoic Acids. Part V. Crystal Structures of the Nematogenic Acids Having Three and Five Alkyl-Chain Carbon Atoms: Molecular Crystals and Liquid Crystals: Vol 62, No 3-4 The crystal structures of  p -n-propoxy- and  p -n-pentoxy-benzoic acids (3OBAC and 5OBAC) have been determined at room temperature by single-crystal x-ray analysis. Both crystals have sheet structures. Within each sheet the molecules are arranged as hydrogen-bonded dimers in head-to-tail fashion in parallel staggered rows. The long axes of the aromatic nuclei are almost normal to crystal  b . The alkyl chains are in planar extended form, but the ether oxygen and C(γ) are in a  gauche  relation about the C(α)-C(β) bond of the chain. The stacking of sheets is slightly different in 3OBAC which undergoes a solid-solid transition before yielding a nematic phase, than in 5OBAC which transforms directly to the nematic state. The tight face-to-face overlap of phenyl rings characteristic of the crystal structures of the two lowest homologs in the series, which are non-mesogenic at atmospheric pressure, is absent in these crystal structures where the ring planes in adjacent sheets are inclined to one another by about 55°. Nematogenic behavior is attributed to parallel alignment of molecules in the solid coupled to a weakening of the solid-state intermolecular forces, arising from difficulty in accomodating the increasing steric bulk of the alkyl chains with respect to the aromatic nuclei.
