experienced player behind center helps with communication with his receivers and avoiding poor throws that can lead to interceptions he s a huge factor in the fact he knows how the flow of the game s going klieman said he knows can he take a chance can he be more aggressive he knows where his receivers are going to be he sees things pre-snap so well and he s on the same page with his receivers and tight ends that s a big thing to have your senior quarterback know how everybody fits in with the scheme of our offense. ndsu safety james hendricks was named the valley s defensive player of the week

be successful klieman said the bison have scored a valley-leading 66 points off 14 turnovers moreover ndsu has allowed an opponent inside its 20-yard line only eight times this season surrendering three touchdowns and two field goals klieman said running back bruce anderson and safety robbie grimsley both suffered hamstring injuries against western illinois he thinks both could return to
