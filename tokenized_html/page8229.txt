the equivalence between off-resonance and on-resonance pulse sequences and its application to steady-state free precession with diffusion in inhomogeneous fields freed de 1 h√ºrlimann md scheven um author information 1 schlumberger-doll research 36 old quarry road ridgefield ct 06877 usa dfreed ridgefield.oilfield.slb.com p we show that the spin dynamics of any pulse sequence with off-resonant pulses is identical to that of a modified sequence with on-resonant pulses includingrelaxation and diffusion effects this equivalence applies to pulse sequenceswith arbitrary offset frequency deltaomega 0 which may exceed the rf fieldstrength omega 1 using this approach we examine steady-state free precession ssfp in grossly inhomogeneous fields we show explicitly that the magnitude of the magnetization for each mode at an offset frequency deltaomega 0 is equal to that for ssfp with on-resonance pulses of rescaled amplitude with the samedependence on relaxation times and diffusion coefficient the rescaling dependson offset frequency and rf field strength the theoretical results have beentested experimentally and excellent agreement is found
