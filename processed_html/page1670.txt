Amazon CloudWatch: How to find ARN of CloudWatch Log group - Stack Overflow                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 I configure Custom Access Logging for Amazon API Gateway and I need to specify CloudWatch Group name, but when I put these just name of log group in format like "API-Gateway-Execution-Logs_3j5w5m7kv9/stage-name" I get such error: Invalid ARN specified in the request. ARNs must start with 'arn:':  API-Gateway-Execution-Logs_3j5w5m7kv9/stage-name When I open page of this log group in CloudWatch I just see the same name there and don't see ARN value. How can I find it? Go to Cloudwatch logs, find your log group, open it and you'll see a list of log streams. There is settings icon on top right: Click it and you'll see an option to show stream arn: Save the settings and you'll see stream arns. The part before semicolon looks like Log Group arn The  CloudWatch Group ARN  format is  arn:aws:logs:{region}:{account-id}:log-group:API-Gateway-Execution-Logs_{rest-api-id}/{stage-name} , cf.  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-logging.html If people would write good documentation of the tools they offer, or add common sense UX patterns,  common sense shouldn´t take you 20 min searching for it.
