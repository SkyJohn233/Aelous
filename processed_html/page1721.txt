Top 10 Liverpool strikers of the Premier League era - #3 - Sports Mole © Reuters Was there a better out-and-out centre-forward in world football than Fernando Torres during his time at  Liverpool ? The Spaniard made a blistering start to his career at Anfield following his move from Atletico Madrid in 2007, scoring 24 league goals and 33 across all competitions during his debut campaign. With  Mohamed Salah  still stuck on 49 at the time of writing, Torres remains the fastest Liverpool player to reach 50 Premier League goals for the club and eventually attained a tally of 65 in just 102 outings. Torres's acrimonious departure in a January deadline-day £50m switch to Chelsea - and the subsequent struggles he endured at Stamford Bridge - threatened to tarnish his reputation both at Anfield and beyond, but he was almost unplayable during his prime. Liverpool finished second with Torres leading the line and  Steven Gerrard  in support in 2008-09, but his spell on Merseyside ended without silverware in an otherwise trophy-laden career.
