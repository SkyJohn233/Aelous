bob larson casts out dustly the demon zack hunt this is a really disturbing video for a variety of reasons mostly because it involves bob larson but what i m really curious about here isn t whether or not this woman was possessed by a demon but rather how much did larson charge to cast that demon out of her however much he charged it was more than jesus charged to drive out demons just saying youtube 7pqqvkqmghs found at christian nightmares why does dustly from egypt sometimes have a british accent this would actually be quite funny if it wasn t so infuriating bob larson is continuing the scam game he started years ago on his radio show different schtick same game your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name email website
