Dutch Gold s Alfalfa Honey has been produced in the Wind River area of Wyoming, just outside of Riverton. In this part of central Wyoming, the alfalfa is irrigated, due to the dry conditions, and the plant is allowed to bloom for seed production, which is exactly what the beekeepers want. When the alfalfa bloom opens, the honey bees rush to collect the nectar to produce a delightful golden honey. Alfalfa Honey is a very mild, delicate honey. Perfect for sweetening beverages, drizzling over your vanilla ice cream, or making Luella Gamber s delicious Pumpkin Pie recipe. Alfalfa 1 lb. ,  (3) 1 lb. ,  (6) 1 lb. No products in the cart. 46 N.
