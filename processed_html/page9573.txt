Chambers  &  Partners 2017                             “Mesothelioma is an extremely aggressive, and sadly, incurable, form of cancer caused by exposure to asbestos dust and fibres – something which leads to the death of more than 2,500 people in the UK every year.“We are investigating Akber’s exposure during his time at Fort Dunlop and hope that those who worked alongside him will come forward with any information they have about the presence of asbestos and what measures were in place to protect employees from exposure to the deadly dust and fibres. “We hope to help Akber’s family understand how and where he was exposed to asbestos as they continue to seek answers following his death less than a year after his diagnosis.”                                                      Mesothelioma is an extremely aggressive, and sadly, incurable, form of cancer caused by exposure to asbestos dust and fibres – something which leads to the death of more than 2,500 people in the UK every year. “We are investigating Mick’s exposure during his time at Smith Corona and hope that those who worked alongside him will come forward with any information they have about the presence of asbestos and what measures were in place to protect employees from exposure to the deadly dust and fibres. “We hope to help Mick’s family understand how and where he was exposed to asbestos as they continue to seek answers following his sudden death just mere weeks after his diagnosis.”                                                     “Mesothelioma is an extremely aggressive, and sadly, terminal cancer caused by asbestos exposure decades before symptoms develop. We often see cases like Jane’s where victims were unaware they were battling mesothelioma until the very end of their lives.“As a result they are sometimes unable to provide exact details of how and where they came into contact with asbestos, often leaving their loved ones with unanswered questions.“The first Asbestos Regulations, to manage the use of asbestos because of its danger to health, became law in 1931, so to learn that people were exposed to the fibres much later is very upsetting for the individuals or the families who come to us."Anyone with information about working conditions at Cadbury in Birmingham or Joseph Lucas during the 1960s, particularly anyone who may remember working with Jane, should contact us as soon as possible, no matter how insignificant you feel your information may be.”                                                     “Margaret’s family have been left devastated at the loss of their mother. It was a complete shock to be told that her Margaret had a fatal asbestos illness. “We are keen to speak to anyone who worked at or undertook refurbishment at Classic Cinema, Quinton or the Hippodrome during the period when Margaret was employed. “Any information from people engaged in refurbishment and / or fellow colleagues or friends who worked alongside her could prove vital in securing the information we need to secure justice for Margaret and her family”.
