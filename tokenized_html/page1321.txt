monroe piercing healing over inside my lip what can i do yahoo answers i had my lip pierced about 8 days ago at first the normal swelling and pain was there and i was ok with that about 3 days ago i noticed a lil white piece of skin covering half of the back inside my mouth i thought this is normal it was just skin dieing off the next day even more swelling was there and looked like the entire back was covered but i could still push it out so went back to the piercer and without looking at it enouraged me it was totally normal the next day which is today the entire back of it is in my lip and unable to push it out of the even smaller white circle covering the backing now im freaked out what do i do is it normal for this to be happening i read so many different sites some say it is ok and some not and the professional piercing site doesnt even involve this question at all i x27 m going through the same thing rite now i got it pierced early november and ddnt notice til a couple of wks ago that there x27 s this huge piece of skin that x27 s covering nearly the whole back of the piercing i remember when i was getting it pierced the place told me this mite happen and they suggested either going to a hospital to get it popped or back to the place that pierced it and they x27 ll take care of it i dnt think they x27 re dangerous but i x27 m guessing if it gets big enough it x27 ll start to bother u the reason it happens is prolly cuz we ddnt clean it enough or cleaned it too much but basically it x27 s also a healthy way ur body rejects the piercing by trying to heal over it go see another piercer if you x27 re concerned if the one you went to never even took a look he doesn x27 t sound particularly professional it might be that your labret stud is too short to accommodate for swelling or the disc on the back of the stud might be too small i wouldn x27 t go to a doctor most tend to be ignorant when it comes to piercings i saw a doctor when my antibrow piercing was infected she told me to take the jewellery out straight away when of course the piercing needs to act as a drain for the infection lots of reasons that is happening 1.not brushing your teeth well plac will infect it 2.your not cleaning it well enuf 3.their is a piece of food stuck in/around it 4.the stem is way to small but the main reason is that your skin is rejecting the piercing it sounds like its very swollen the best thing you could do would be to get a second opinion from a different piercer or go to your doctors go to a doctor take it out and let it heal over i x27 ve had the same problem your going to look silly when your lip falls of you sillygirl that x27 s what you get when you get a piercing oh oh oh oh drown out all my blah blah blah paramore owns for acne fair complexion tanning sunburn marks spots make up tips hair issues n other skin n hair problems u can refer to dis website http //skincaretipps148.notlong.com it has got so many tips n free beauty samples for curing acne and all your skin problems
