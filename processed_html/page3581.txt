Clavipectoral triangle | Revolvy The  clavipectoral triangle  (also known as the  deltopectoral triangle ) is an anatomical region found in humans and other animals. It is bordered by the following structures:  It contains the  cephalic vein , [4]  and deltopectoral fascia, which is a layer of deep fascia that invests the three structures that make up the border of the triangle.  The deltoid branch of the  thoracoacromial artery  also passes through this triangle, giving branches to both the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles.  The  subclavian vein  and the  subclavian artery  may be accessed via this triangle, as they are deep to it.

It is subdivided into gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy. Gross anatomy (also called topographical anatomy, regional anatomy, or anthropotomy) is the study of anatomical structures that can be seen by unaided vision. Microscopic anatomy is the study of minute anatomical structures assisted with microscopes, and includes histology (the study of the organization of tissues), and cytology (the study of cells).
