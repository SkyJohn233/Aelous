BBC - Hampshire - Pompey fans set for Wembley final Despite their club's financial woes and relegation from the Premier League, Portsmouth fans will be supporting their team at Wembley in their usual colourful style. Over 30,000 will make the trip from the south coast to Wembley, while others around the world will be glued to television screens as Pompey take on the might of Premier League champions, Chelsea. Bubble car fans James Blake, a plumber from Portsmouth, is driving to the cup final in his beloved bubble car.  The car, which has been sprayed blue in honour of his team, has taken him five years to restore and get on the road in all its former glory.  James originally bought it as a wreck in 2005 and has given it a complete overhaul.  He first made the 80-mile (129km) trip to see Pompey beat Spurs in the semi-final and is hoping this is a lucky form of transport - although he will have to make an early start as the car cannot go much faster than 40mph.  The semi-final trip was certainly eventful, James explained:  " We ran out of petrol, smoke started pouring out and we broke down on Oxford Street, but there were cameras snapping us wherever we went.  " We're just going to have a good day out - having seen the Chelsea result last week, we don't want to think about the result! We'll see how it goes and cross our fingers! " Staying away While just about every Portsmouth fan around the the world will be glued the television for the cup final, Chris Davis from Havant is eager to miss the match. Chris, a former BBC cycling commentator, says he missed the last two wins at Wembley (the semi-final against Spurs and the last FA Cup final win against Cardiff), both times he was in France at major cycling events.  The Tour of Picardy always takes place in mid-May and clashes with the cup final. And yet again, Chris will be across the channel when his team take to the Wembley turf.  He said:  " I'm a great believer in superstition - third time luckily this time. Keeping my fingers and toes crossed that we'll have the cup back in Portsmouth. I'm looking for a a surprise victory against the odds. " Pompey fans down under An Irish pub in Perth, Australia will be hosting a gathering of up to 70 Portsmouth fans and friends for a 'Farewell to the Premiership Party' before the game kicks off at 2200 local time.  Chairman of                           Pompey Down Under (PDU),                  Peter Marchant who lived in Portsmouth and attended Mayfield School before his family emigrated to emigrated to Perth in 1983, has remained a passionate fan despite the distance.  He said:  " The general mood in the membership is one of incredulity that we reached the final in such a horribly traumatic season. The Spurs semi final was one of my proudest moments as a Pompey fan and ranks alongside the win at Old Trafford in the quarter final two years ago.  " In many respects, that was our Cup Final and I believe that restricting Chelsea to respectable score will still be a moral victory! Many have said it will either be a single goal, fighting tooth and nail victory for Pompey - or a massive win for Chelsea. I was glad that Chelsea won the Premiership last Sunday - hopefully it was a distraction.  " I do feel that the Premiership has killed off some of the magic about football that I grew up with. Players are aloof, disloyal and generally greedy... I hope that a Pompey win at the weekend can bring some of that magic back. " PDU is the official supporters club for fans of Pompey in Australia - around 60 members are flying to the UK to watch the match at Wembley.  Pompey bear Pompey are reknowned for their colourful support. Also in Australia, Charles Alum needs no excuse to jump into his 'Pompey Bear' outfit.  'Pompey Bear' was born after a  " drunken chat "  and had a few outings at Fratton Park before Charles moved to Sydney.  Charles said:  " I've been Pompey Bear a few times in Sydney - even done some birthday parties! I can't wait for Saturday! " Charles also wore his bear suit when he returned for Pompey's appearance in the 2008 final.  He said:  " I'm gutted I'm not going this year, but I'm going back for the World Cup and a wedding in December, so can't justify three trips! Seems like all the 2008 lads are staying too so there will be a good atmosphere here.  " We thought 2008 would be the one and only time. Now it's two in three years!
