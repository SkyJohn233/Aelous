Most overrated hero? : DotA2 What heroes do you think are overrated? IMO Faceless Void is really overhyped. His Ult isn &# x27;t good for teamfights and without it he &# x27;s almost useless because of his frailty whereas other carries like Spectre, Anti Mage and Medusa can still do a ton of damage without their ult. TIL that Chronosphere isn &# x27;t good for team fights and backtrack doesn &# x27;t make void tanky. dude chronosphere is shit for teamfights. don &# x27;t ever run void with lich or witch doctor it &# x27;s so awful there &# x27;s no synergy at all  kappa Techies /thread Yes Steven, I &# x27;d like to put an order in for 3 truckloads of upvotes. I disagree with the Faceless Void overhype, he &# x27;s honestly not really overrated because you rarely see him picked honestly. And with farm, he can basically 1v1 even 1v2 people even without his ult. And if you build a team around his ult, his ult is quite good, ie, void + aa, disruptor, witchdoctor, kunkka, tidehunter are all good examples. Of course, if you have nothing but right clickers on your team, then yes, he &# x27;s not the best option for team fights. Ember i think is a bit overrated both in pubs and in the pro scene. In the pro scene Ember does feel strong but because the team is somewhat build around him. In pubs most of the time he just gets fucked in early and doesn &# x27;t do shit until the 40 min mark ( exceptions of course ) Faceless Void isn &# x27;t overhyped at all, he is as he always was the buffs and tweaks just make him more viable. Away from drafting around his ult he can have very different play stiles. You can rush Aghs and play him like a strong disabler in the mid game, or just play him greedy and farm away for late when he 1v5. And about frailty i don &# x27;t know what to say backtrack is pretty good 1 level is more than enough to get lucky and dodge the killing blow, and also timewalk with the buff it got is a reliable escape mechanic. He is strong but he needs coordination to play with your team. Well people pick pudge every game i play and they rarely do well, so i guess pudge. I don &# x27;t think people think pudge is overrated. I don &# x27;t think people, or at least most people, think that picking pudge means they &# x27;re gonna win or something. People just pick pudge cuz he &# x27;s fun, I play hard carry with a group of people, but when I go solo I &# x27;m almost always picking pudge cuz he &# x27;s fun. Any hero with a skill shot is fun really, it &# x27;s much more satisfactory when you land a hook, dismember, and kill, then let &# x27;s say antimage who &# x27;s just gonna blink, right click for days, then maybe ult if needed. Naga no more nerfs pls Icefrog In my opinion, CM. I agree. Full disclosure...I am terrible at cm 100% WR in 6.81 pro-dota Medusa by some, Techies by majority and SWM by absolute majority. En chuan tress As of now, Gyrocopter. Dude needs a buff and even though it has fallen off a bit, it &# x27;s still consistently picked but there is almost always a better alternative. Crystal Maiden. honestly can &# x27;t think of any... 627k Members 8.3k Online Oct 13, 2010 Cake Day
