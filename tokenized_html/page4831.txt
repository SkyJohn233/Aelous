version of dyson common path interferometer using a concave mirror diverger sketch of interferometer head for test and reference beams input pbs rotated to set beam intensity ratio and as polariser for camera omitted if a npbs is substituted a reflective diverger on ais bath results with orthogonally polarised test and reference beams so that psi is possible using a qwp and a polariser in the camera arm bruce gleb sorry that s the source/camera side with polarisation at 45 degrees to the s and p planes of the beamsplitter cube the bottom of the diagram is where the test surface is beyond the focus shown bruce gleb there s also a version where the pbs lies between the test beam focus and the test surface however that isn t as useful when using an auxiliary lens to allow testing of faster test mirrors i need to check if i have enough parts to bolt it together from agilent/zygo/excel laser dmi components i may need a few more v coated 633nm qwps bruce gleb there s also a version

have a small collection of 633nm pbs cubes i intended to try the dyson version with 2 polarising beamsplitters one tilted 45 degrees wrt the plane of the rest of the optical path as shown in his 1957 paper on the triplet lens common path interferometer bruce p toggle quoted message show quoted text on closer examination there is subtle difference the second beamsplitter is rotated by 90 degrees wrt to that shown in the september 2012 version my version automatically has the same sa contribution for both beams from the beamsplitter cube and quarter waveplates the path length through the head is also slightly shorter bruce michael thanks i missed that looks like i ve rediscovered the wheel yet again i have a small collection of 633nm pbs cubes i intended to try the dyson version with 2

rear could be used i should have one or two of these bruce gleb a positive lens is far more effective the positive lens brings the collimated beam from the beamsplitter asembly to a focus and it then diverges to become the test beam which illuminates the test surface whilst the same positive lens reimages the focus of the convergent beam from the beamsplitter assembly onto the test surface to become the reference beam the positive lens forms an image of the test surface at the focus of the convergent beam from the beamsplitter assembly which is reimaged by the spherical mirror to infinity

beam expander has the advantage that the focus of the divergent beam produced by the beamsplitter assembly need not be real or physically accessible the beam expander could even be designed to allow the use of a microscope objective as the second lens the lens closest to the test surface an infinity corrected microscope objective or equivalent is probably ideal using a microscope objective potentially allows very fast concave spheres to be tested a standard finite conjugate microscope objective can be used in conjunction with a negative lens so that the combination is infinity corrected

function qlabel-56682468 .text show quoted text gleb yes but probably not without the assistance of another lens given that the f of the divergent beam produced by the beamsplitter assembly has to be relatively large.. the simplest way is probably to treat the refractive offner null as a finite conjugate microscope objective albeit with a somewhat large diameter positive lens and a field lens a small positive lens simultaneously focuses the collimated beam from the beamsplitter assembly onto the image of the test surface formed by the refractive offner null and diverges the convergent beam from the beamsplitter assembly to fully illuminate the test surface image and hence the test surface setup is similar to that shown for a finite conjugate microscope objective bruce the new topic will
