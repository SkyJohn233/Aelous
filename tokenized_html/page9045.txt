shaka shaka sometimes spelled tshaka tchaka or chaka ca 1787 ca 22 september 1828 is widely credited with transforming the zulu tribe from a small clan into the beginnings of a nation that held sway over that portion of southern africa between the phongolo and mzimkhulu rivers his military prowess and destructiveness have been widely credited one encyclopaedia britannica article macropaedia article shaka 1974 ed asserts that he was something of a military genius for his reforms and innovations other writers take a more limited view nevertheless his statesmanship and vigour in assimilating some neighbours and ruling by proxy through others marks him as one of the greatest zulu chieftains // shaka was probably the first son of the chieftain senzangakhona and nandi a daughter of the past chief of the langeni tribe born near present-day melmoth kwazulu-natal province he was conceived out of wedlock somewhere between 1781 and 1787 some accounts state that he was disowned by his father and chased into exile others maintain that his parents married normally when his mother became pregnant with him she claimed that her growing belly was because of a shaka or intestinal beetle hence his name shaka almost certainly spent his childhood in his father s settlements is recorded as having been initiated there and inducted into an ibutho or age-group regiment in his early days shaka served as a warrior under the sway of local chieftain dingiswayo and the mthethwa to whom the zulu were then paying tribute dingiswayo called up the emdlatsheni intanga age-group of which shaka was part and incorporated it in the izicwe regiment shaka served as a mthethwa warrior for perhaps as long as ten years and distinguished himself with his courage though he did not as legend has it rise to great position dingiswayo having himself been exiled after a failed attempt to oust his father had along with a number of other groups in the region including mabhudu dlamini mkhize qwabe and ndwandwe many probably responding to slaving pressures from southern mozambique helped develop new ideas of military and social organisation in particular the ibutho sometimes translated as regiment it was rather an age-based labour gang which included some better-refined military activities but by no means exclusively most battles before this time were to settle disputes and while the appearance of the impi fighting unit dramatically changed warfare at times it largely remained a matter of seasonal raiding political pressures rather than outright slaughter of particular importance here is the relationship which shaka and dingiswayo had on the death of senzangakona dingiswayo aided shaka to defeat his brother and assume leadership in around 1812 shaka began to refine the ibutho system further used by dingiswayo and others and with mthethwa s support over the next several years forged alliances with his smaller neighbours mostly to counter the growing threat from ndwandwe raiding from the north the initial zulu manoeuvres were defensive and offensive and mostly shaka preferred to intervene or pressure diplomatically aided by just a few judicious assassinations his changes to local society built on existing structures and were as much social and propagandistic as they were military there were a number of battles as the zulu sources make clear later dingiswayo was murdered by zwide a powerful chief of the ndwandwe nxumalo clan shaka took it upon himself to avenge dingiswayo s blood at some point zwide barely escaped shaka though the exact details are not known in that encounter zwide s mother a sangoma zulu word for a seer more than it is a traditional doctor this person can consult the spirits of the dead cast spells bewitch heal and many others was killed by shaka shaka chose a particularly gruesome revenge on zwide s mother locking her in a house and placing jackals or hyenas inside they devoured her and in the morning shaka burned the house to the ground despite carrying out this revenge shaka was still eager to kill zwide it was not until around 1825 that the two great military men would meet near phongola in what would be their final meeting phongola is near the present day border of kwazulu-natal a province in south africa the victory went to shaka however he sustained heavy casualties and lost his head military commander umgobhozi ovela entabeni in the initial years shaka had neither the clout nor the kudos to compel any but the smallest of groups to join him and he operated under dingiswayo s aegis until the latter s death at the hands of zwide s ndwandwe at this point shaka moved southwards across the thukela river establishing his capital bulawayo in qwabe territory he never did personally move back into the traditional zulu heartland in qwabe shaka may have intervened in an existing succession dispute and help his own choice nqetho into power nqetho then ruled as a proxy chieftain for shaka shaka s hegemony was primarily based on military might smashing rivals and incorporating scattered remnants into his own army he supplemented this with a mixture of diplomacy and patronage incorporating friendly chieftains including zihlandlo of the mkhize jobe of the sithole and mathubane of the thuli these peoples were never defeated in battle by the zulu they did not have to be shaka won them over by subtler tactics of patronage and reward the ruling qwabe for example began re-inventing their genealogies to give the impression that qwabe and zulu were closely related in the past -a handy fiction in this way a greater sense of cohesion was created though it never became complete as subsequent civil wars attest in 1816 after the death of his father shaka had seized power over the then-insignificant zulu clan though he was boosted in by the mthethwa and his brother sigujana was killed the coup was relatively bloodless and accepted by the zulu shaka still recognised dingiswayo and his larger mthethwa clan as overlord after he returned to the zulu but some years later dingiswayo was ambushed by zwide s amandwandwe and killed there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that shaka betrayed dingiswayo indeed the core zulu had to retreat before several ndwandwe incursions the ndwandwe were clearly the most aggressive grouping in the sub-region shaka was able to form an alliance with the leaderless mthethwa clan and was able to establish himself amongst the qwabe after phakathwayo was overthrown without much of a fight if any with qwabe hlubi and mkhize support shaka was finally able to summon a force capable of resisting the ndwandwe of the nxumalo clan historians like donald morris washing of the spears state that shaka s first major battle against zwide of the ndwandwe was the battle of gqokli hill on the mfolozi river shaka s troops maintained a strong position on the crest of the hill a frontal assault by their opponents failed to dislodge them and shaka sealed the victory by sending elements in a sweep around the hill to attack the enemy s rear losses were high overall but the efficacy of the new shakan innovations was proved it is probable that over time the zulu were able to hone and improve their encirclement tactics another decisive fight eventually took place on the mhlatuze river at the confluence with the mvuzane stream in a two-day running battle the zulu inflicted a resounding defeat on their opponents shaka then led a fresh reserve some seventy miles to ndwandwe ruler zwide s royal kraal and destroyed it zwide himself escaped with a handful of followers before falling foul of a chieftainess named mjanji ruler of the bapedi clan he died in mysterious circumstances shortly after shaka s general soshangane of the shangaan moved off north towards what is now mozambique to inflict further damage on less resistant foes and take advantage of slaving opportunities causing portuguese traders to give tribute shaka later had to contend again with zwide s son sikhunyane in 1826 dingane and mhlangana shaka s half-brothers appear to have made at least two attempts to assassinate shaka before they succeeded with perhaps support from mpondo elements and some disaffected iziyendane people while the british colonialists considered his regime to be a future threat allegations that white traders wished his death are problematic given that shaka had granted concessions to whites prior to his death including the right to settle at port natal now durban shaka had made enough enemies among his own people to hasten his demise it came relatively quickly after the devastation caused by shaka s erratic behaviour after the death of his mother nandi according to the washing of the spears by donald r. morris and mangosuthu chief buthelezi in this mourning period shaka ordered that no crops should be planted during the following year no milk the basis of the zulu diet at the time was to be used and any woman who became pregnant would be killed along with her husband massacres were carried out of those deemed insufficiently grief-stricken though it wasn t restricted to them and cows were slaughtered so that their calves would know what losing a mother felt like the zulu monarch was killed by three assassins sometime in 1828 september is the most often cited date when almost all available zulu manpower had been sent on yet another mass sweep to the north this left the royal kraal critically short of security it was all the conspirators needed- shaka s half-brothers dingane and mhlangana and an induna called mbopa a diversion was created by mbopa and dingane and mhlangana struck the fatal blows film and book portrayals of dramatic pre-death speeches by shaka warning of future european imperialism lack credibility as do stories of colorful and impressive burial ceremonies in reality shaka s corpse was dumped into an empty grain pit by his assassins and filled with stones the exact site is unknown historian donald morris holds that it is somewhere on couper street in the village of stanger south africa shaka s half-brother dingane assumed power and embarked on an extensive purge of pro-shaka elements and chieftains running over several years in order to secure his position a virtual civil war broke out dingane ruled for some twelve years during which time he fought disastrously against the voortrekkers and against another half-brother mpande who with boer and british support took over the zulu leadership in 1840 and ruled for some 30 years later in the 19th century the zulus would be one of the few african peoples who managed to defeat the british army at the battle of isandlwana some revisionists have doubted the military and social innovations customarily attributed to shaka denying them outright or attributing them variously to european influences but both explanations fall short in fact the zulu culture which included other tribes and clans contained a number of practices that shaka could have drawn on to fulfill his objectives- whether in raiding conquest or hegemony some of these practices are shown below shaka is often said to have been dissatisfied with the long throwing assegai and credited with introducing a new variant of the weapon the iklwa a short stabbing spear with a long swordlike spearhead it was named allegedly for the sound made as it went in then out of the body shaka is also supposed to have introduced a larger heavier shield made of cowhide and to have taught each warrior how to use the shield s left side to hook the enemy s shield to the right exposing his ribs for a fatal spear stab the throwing spear was not discarded but used as an initial missile weapon until the impis closed with the enemy hand to hand introduction of a shorter stabbing spear area makes practical sense if an attack is to be pressed home versus ritualized stand-off encounters involving throwing spears as is the use of a larger shield in such close quarters combat implementation of a more reliable hand-held weapon would have been a must for aggressive raiding operations implemented under the shakan regime the story that sandals were discarded to toughen the feet of his men may or may not be accurate but the bare feet of many zulu warriors has been noted in various military accounts see donald morris the washing of the spears or edgerton s they fought like lions or ian knight s anatomy of the zulu army implementation was typically blunt those who objected to going without sandals were simply killed a practice that quickly concentrated the minds of available personnel shaka drilled his troops frequently implementing forced marches covering more than fifty miles a day in a fast trot over hot rocky terrain he also drilled the troops to carry out encirclement tactics see below young boys from the age of six up joined shaka s force as apprentice warriors udibi and served as carriers of rations supplies like cooking pots and sleeping mats and extra weapons until they joined the main ranks it is sometimes held that such support was used more for very light forces designed to extract tribute in cattle women or young men from neighbouring groups nevertheless the concept of light forces is questionable the fast-moving zulu raiding party or impi on a mission did travel light driving cattle as provisions on the hoof and were not weighed down with heavy weapon and supply packs the herdboy logistic structure was deployed in support of such activities and was easily adaptable whether the force was numerous heavy or not age-grade groupings of various sorts were common in the bantu tribal culture of the day and indeed are still important in much of africa age grades were responsible for a variety of activities from guarding the camp to cattle herding to certain rituals and ceremonies shaka organized various grades into regiments and quartered them in special military kraals with each regiment having its own distinctive names and insignia the regimental system clearly built on existing tribal cultural elements that could be adapted and shaped to fit an expansionist agenda there was no need to look for european inspiration hundreds of miles away most historians morris knight et al credit shaka with initial development of the famous buffalo horns formation it was composed of three elements coordination was supplied by regimental indunas chiefs or leaders who used hand signals and messengers the scheme was elegant in its simplicity and well understood by the warriors assigned to each echelon some controversy has arisen over whether the zulu chieftain could have developed such a system however the use of separate maneuver elements to support a stronger central group is well known in pre-mechanized tribal warfare as is the use of reserve elements farther back indeed some xhosa groups of southern africa used separate elements including an advance guard see noel mostert s history of southern africa frontiers and mcmillian s boer bantu and briton morris notes on page 38 that attempts to surround an enemy were not unknown even in the ritualized battles the host were generally partitioned into 3 levels regiments corps of several regiments and armies or bigger formations although the zulu did not use these terms in the modern sense any grouping of men on a mission could collectively be called an impi whether a raiding party of 100 or horde of 10,000 numbers were not uniform but dependent on a variety of factors including assignments by the king or the manpower mustered by various clan chiefs or localities a regiment might be 400 or 4000 men these were grouped into corps that took their name from the military kraals where they were mustered or sometimes the dominant regiment of that locality the expanding zulu power inevitably clashed with white hegemony in the decades after shaka death indeed white travelers to shaka s kingdom demonstrated advanced technology such as firearms and writing but the zulu monarch was less than convinced there was no need to record messages he held since his messengers stood under penalty of death should they bear inaccurate tidings as for firearms shaka was impressed but after seeing muzzleloaders demonstrated he argued that in the time the gunmen took to reload the gunmen would be swamped by charging spear-wielding warriors ironically this latter boast was to be put to the test against european opponents where the zulu were defeated the first major clash after shaka s death took place under his successor dingane against expanding white voortrekkers from the cape initial zulu success rested on fast moving surprise attacks and ambushes but the voortrekkers recovered and dealt the zulu a severe defeat from their fortified wagon laager at the battle of blood river the second major clash was against the british during 1879 once again most zulu successes rested on their mobility and ability to screen their forces and close quickly when their opponents were unfavorably deployed their major victory at the battle of isandlwana is well known but they also forced back a british column at the battle of hlobane mountain deploying fast moving regiments over a wide area in the rugged ravines and gulleys while the british were on the move nevertheless the zulu failed to learn from their earlier defeats and persisted in human wave attacks against well defended static european positions where massed firepower decimated their ranks it is questionable whether shaka might have done things differently certainly his operations during his rise to power showed both imagination and flexibility his successors could argue that they had faithfully followed his classical template which had advanced the zulu from a small obscure tribe to a strong regional power but it is also clear that those following shaka lacked his tactical vision and acumen sweeping claims that shaka changed the nature of warfare in africa from a ritualised exchange of taunts with minimal loss of life into a true method of subjugation by wholesale slaughter are open to question certainly his military campaigns created widespread destruction and local distress where his impis were active when the bigger picture of the entire region is considered several other factors come into play including white expansion at the cape slaving in mozambique and the usual assortment of agricultural pressures common to that region still on the balance it seems clear that shaka s military expansion caused much disruption and turmoil of the mfecane and played a major role in shaping the area where he resided and beyond like every other aspiring hegemon shaka faced dissent and opposition but the mere presence of these did not negate his activities or plans and while sweeping broad brush claims of shaka s revolutionary impact must be treated with caution so too must more limited revisionist assertions which in turn fail to achieve a balanced view of the shakan tenure and fail to see that the tribal structures and culture itself provided enough precedent and raw material for shaka to embark on his plans of hegemony or expansion and many of the innovations he is traditionally credited with thunderer-while-sitting son of menzi he is the bird that preys on other birds the battle-axe that excels over other battle axes he is the long-strided pursuer son of ndaba who pursued the sun and the moon he is the great hubbub like the rocks of nkandla where elephants take shelter when the heavens frown the figure of shaka still sparks interest among not only the contemporary zulu but many worldwide who have encountered the tribe and its history the current tendency appears to be to lionize him popular film and other media have certainly contributed to his appeal against this must be balanced the devastation and destruction that he wrought and yet traditional zulu culture still reveres the dread monarch as the typical praise song above attests it should be noted that praise names are among the most widely used poetic forms in africa applying not only to gods but to men animals plants and even towns the increased military efficiency led to more and more clans being incorporated into shaka s zulu empire while other tribes moved away to be out of range of shaka s impis the ripple effect caused by these mass migrations would become known though only in the twentieth century as the mfecane some groups which moved off like the hlubi and ngwane to the north of the zulus could have been impelled by the ndwandwe not the zulu some moved south like the chunu and the thembe but never suffered much in the way of attack it was precautionary and they left many people behind in their traditional homelands among the many fascinating cases of the mfecane is that of mzilikazi of the khumalo who was a general of shaka s who fled shaka s employ and in turn conquered an empire in zimbabwe after clashing with european groups like the boers other notable figures to arise from the mfecane include shoshangane who expanded from the zulu area into what is now mozambique shaka was clearly a tough able leader the most able of his time and during the last four years of his reign indulged in several long-distance raids the theory of the mfecane holds that the aggressive expansion of shaka s armies caused a brutal chain reaction across the southern areas of the continent as dispossessed tribe after tribe turned on their neighbors in a deadly cycle of flight and conquest this theory must be treated with caution as it generally neglects several other factors such as the impact of white encroachment and expansion in that area of southern africa around the same time revised histories have cast doubt on the concept of the mfecane and its attribution of wholesale migration and destruction to the zulu a more balanced approach sees zulu expansionism as one of a number of factors albeit an important one that disrupted traditional patterns of the local area one outstanding example of the traditional view of the mfecane is j.d omer-cooper s the zulu aftermath it is safe to say that shaka was not like an african version of napoleon or bernard montgomery with a master-plan to the contrary the record shows a shrewd if harsh manipulator of circumstances customs and events to cobble together the zulu nation under difficult circumstances and with patchy success at times
