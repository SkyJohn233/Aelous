atomic structure and symbolism chemistry i by the end of this section you will be able to the development of modern atomic theory revealed much about the inner structure of atoms it was learned that an atom contains a very small nucleus composed of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons surrounded by a much larger volume of space containing negatively charged electrons the nucleus contains the majority of an atom s mass because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons whereas electrons occupy almost all of an atom s volume the diameter of an atom is on the order of 10 −10 m whereas the diameter of the nucleus is roughly 10 −15 m—about 100,000 times smaller for a perspective about their relative sizes consider this if the nucleus were the size of a blueberry the atom would be about the size of a football stadium figure 1 figure 1 if an atom could be expanded to the size of a football stadium the nucleus would be the size of a single blueberry credit middle modification of work by babyknight /wikimedia commons credit right modification of work by paxson woelber atoms—and the protons neutrons and electrons that compose them—are extremely small for example a carbon atom weighs less than 2 × 10 −23 g and an electron has a charge of less than 2 × 10 −19 c coulomb when describing the properties of tiny objects such as atoms we use appropriately small units of measure such as the atomic mass unit amu and the fundamental unit of charge e the amu was originally defined based on hydrogen the lightest element then later in terms of oxygen since 1961 it has been defined with regard to the most abundant isotope of carbon atoms of which are assigned masses of exactly 12 amu this isotope is known as carbon-12 as will be discussed later in this module thus one amu is exactly 1 12 1 12 \frac 1 12 of the mass of one carbon-12 atom 1 amu 1.6605 × 10 −24 g. the dalton da and the unified atomic mass unit u are alternative units that are equivalent to the amu the fundamental unit of charge also called the elementary charge equals the magnitude of the charge of an electron e with e 1.602 × 10 −19 c. a proton has a mass of 1.0073 amu and a charge of 1+ a neutron is a slightly heavier particle with a mass 1.0087 amu and a charge of zero as its name suggests it is neutral the electron has a charge of 1− and is a much lighter particle with a mass of about 0.00055 amu it would take about 1800 electrons to equal the mass of one proton the properties of these fundamental particles are summarized in table 1 an observant student might notice that the sum of an atom s subatomic particles does not equal the atom s actual mass the total mass of six protons six neutrons and six electrons is 12.0993 amu slightly larger than 12.00 amu this missing mass is known as the mass defect and you will learn about it in the chapter on nuclear chemistry the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is its atomic number z this is the defining trait of an element its value determines the identity of the atom for example any atom that contains six protons is the element carbon and has the atomic number 6 regardless of how many neutrons or electrons it may have a neutral atom must contain the same number of positive and negative charges so the number of protons equals the number of electrons therefore the atomic number also indicates the number of electrons in an atom the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called its mass number a the number of neutrons is therefore the difference between the mass number and the atomic number a – z number of neutrons atomic number z number of protons atomic mass a number of protons number of neutrons a − z number of neutrons atomic number z number of protons atomic mass a number of protons number of neutrons a − z number of neutrons \begin array ccc \hfill \text atomic number \left \text z \right \text number of protons \hfill \\ \hfill \text atomic mass \left \text a \right \text number of protons +\text number of neutrons \hfill \\ \hfill \text a -\text z \text number of neutrons \hfill \end array atoms are electrically neutral if they contain the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons when the numbers of these subatomic particles are not equal the atom is electrically charged and is called an ion the charge of an atom is defined as follows atomic charge number of protons − number of electrons as will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter atoms and molecules typically acquire charge by gaining or losing electrons an atom that gains one or more electrons will exhibit a negative charge and is called an anion positively charged atoms called cations are formed when an atom loses one or more electrons for example a neutral sodium atom z 11 has 11 electrons if this atom loses one electron it will become a cation with a 1+ charge 11 − 10 1+ a neutral oxygen atom z 8 has eight electrons and if it gains two electrons it will become an anion with a 2− charge 8 − 10 2− iodine is an essential trace element in our diet it is needed to produce thyroid hormone insufficient iodine in the diet can lead to the development of a goiter an enlargement of the thyroid gland figure 2 figure 2 a insufficient iodine in the diet can cause an enlargement of the thyroid gland called a goiter b the addition of small amounts of iodine to salt which prevents the formation of goiters has helped eliminate this concern in the us where salt consumption is high credit a modification of work by almazi /wikimedia commons credit b modification of work by mike mozart the addition of small amounts of iodine to table salt iodized salt has essentially eliminated this health concern in the united states but as much as 40 of the world s population is still at risk of iodine deficiency the iodine atoms are added as anions and each has a 1− charge and a mass number of 127 determine the numbers of protons neutrons and electrons in one of these iodine anions the atomic number of iodine 53 tells us that a neutral iodine atom contains 53 protons in its nucleus and 53 electrons outside its nucleus because the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons equals the mass number 127 the number of neutrons is 74 127 − 53 74 since the iodine is added as a 1− anion the number of electrons is 128 127 − 1− 128 an atom of platinum has a mass number of 195 and contains 74 electrons how many protons and neutrons does it contain and what is its charge figure 3 the symbol hg represents the element mercury regardless of the amount it could represent one atom of mercury or a large amount of mercury a chemical symbol is an abbreviation that we use to indicate an element or an atom of an element for example the symbol for mercury is hg figure 3 we use the same symbol to indicate one atom of mercury microscopic domain or to label a container of many atoms of the element mercury macroscopic domain the symbols for several common elements and their atoms are listed in table 2 some symbols are derived from the common name of the element others are abbreviations of the name in another language most symbols have one or two letters but three-letter symbols have been used to describe some elements that have atomic numbers greater than 112 to avoid confusion with other notations only the first letter of a symbol is capitalized for example co is the symbol for the element cobalt but co is the notation for the compound carbon monoxide which contains atoms of the elements carbon c and oxygen o all known elements and their symbols are in the periodic table traditionally the discoverer or discoverers of a new element names the element however until the name is recognized by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac the recommended name of the new element is based on the latin word s for its atomic number for example element 106 was called unnilhexium unh element 107 was called unnilseptium uns and element 108 was called unniloctium uno for several years these elements are now named after scientists or occasionally locations for example element 106 is now known as seaborgium sg in honor of glenn seaborg a nobel prize winner who was active in the discovery of several heavy elements the symbol for a specific isotope of any element is written by placing the mass number as a superscript to the left of the element symbol figure 4 the atomic number is sometimes written as a subscript preceding the symbol but since this number defines the element s identity as does its symbol it is often omitted for example magnesium exists as a mixture of three isotopes each with an atomic number of 12 and with mass numbers of 24 25 and 26 respectively these isotopes can be identified as 24 mg 25 mg and 26 mg these isotope symbols are read as element mass number and can be symbolized consistent with this reading for instance 24 mg is read as magnesium 24 and can be written as magnesium-24 or mg-24. 25 mg is read as magnesium 25 and can be written as magnesium-25 or mg-25. all magnesium atoms have 12 protons in their nucleus they differ only because a 24 mg atom has 12 neutrons in its nucleus a 25 mg atom has 13 neutrons and a 26 mg has 14 neutrons figure 4 the symbol for an atom indicates the element via its usual two-letter symbol the mass number as a left superscript the atomic number as a left subscript sometimes omitted and the charge as a right superscript information about the naturally occurring isotopes of elements with atomic numbers 1 through 10 is given in table 3 note that in addition to standard names and symbols the isotopes of hydrogen are often referred to using common names and accompanying symbols hydrogen-2 symbolized 2 h is also called deuterium and sometimes symbolized d. hydrogen-3 symbolized 3 h is also called tritium and sometimes symbolized t. because each proton and each neutron contribute approximately one amu to the mass of an atom and each electron contributes far less the atomic mass of a single atom is approximately equal to its mass number a whole number however the average masses of atoms of most elements are not whole numbers because most elements exist naturally as mixtures of two or more isotopes the mass of an element shown in a periodic table or listed in a table of atomic masses is a weighted average mass of all the isotopes present in a naturally occurring sample of that element this is equal to the sum of each individual isotope s mass multiplied by its fractional abundance average mass ∑ i fractional abundance × isotopic mass i average mass ∑ i fractional abundance × isotopic mass i \text average mass =\sum i \left \text fractional abundance \times \text isotopic mass \right i for example the element boron is composed of two isotopes about 19.9 of all boron atoms are 10 b with a mass of 10.0129 amu and the remaining 80.1 are 11 b with a mass of 11.0093 amu the average atomic mass for boron is calculated to be boron average mass 0.199 × 10.0129 amu 0.801 × 11.0093 amu 1.99 amu 8.82 amu 10.81 amu boron average mass 0.199 × 10.0129 amu 0.801 × 11.0093 amu 1.99 amu 8.82 amu 10.81 amu \begin array cc \hfill \text boron average mass =\left 0.199\times \text 10.0129 amu \right +\left 0.801\times \text 11.0093 amu \right \hfill \\ =\text 1.99 amu +\text 8.82 amu \hfill \\ =\text 10.81 amu \hfill \end array it is important to understand that no single boron atom weighs exactly 10.8 amu 10.8 amu is the average mass of all boron atoms and individual boron atoms weigh either approximately 10 amu or 11 amu a meteorite found in central indiana contains traces of the noble gas neon picked up from the solar wind during the meteorite s trip through the solar system analysis of a sample of the gas showed that it consisted of 91.84 20 ne mass 19.9924 amu 0.47 21 ne mass 20.9940 amu and 7.69 22 ne mass 21.9914 amu what is the average mass of the neon in the solar wind average mass 0.9184 × 19.9924 amu 0.0047 × 20.9940 amu 0.0769 × 21.9914 amu 18.36 0.099 1.69 amu 20.15 amu average mass 0.9184 × 19.9924 amu 0.0047 × 20.9940 amu 0.0769 × 21.9914 amu 18.36 0.099

\hfill \\ =\left 18.36+0.099+1.69\right \text amu \hfill \\ =\text 20.15 amu \hfill \end array the average mass of a neon atom in the solar wind is 20.15 amu the average mass of a terrestrial neon atom is 20.1796 amu this result demonstrates that we may find slight differences in the natural abundance of isotopes depending on their origin a sample of magnesium is found to contain 78.70 of 24 mg atoms mass 23.98 amu 10.13 of 25 mg atoms mass 24.99 amu and 11.17 of 26 mg atoms mass 25.98 amu calculate the average mass of a mg atom we can also do variations of this type of calculation as shown in the next example naturally occurring chlorine consists of 35 cl mass 34.96885 amu and 37 cl mass 36.96590 amu with an average mass of 35.453 amu what is the percent composition of cl in terms of these two isotopes the average mass of chlorine is the fraction that is 35 cl times the mass of 35 cl plus the fraction that is 37 cl times the mass of 37 cl average mass fraction of 35 cl × mass of 35 cl fraction of 35 cl × mass of 35 cl average mass fraction of 35 cl × mass of 35 cl fraction of 35 cl × mass of 35 cl \text average mass =\left \text fraction of 35 \text cl \times \text mass of 35 \text cl \right +\left \text fraction of 35 \text cl \times \text mass of 35 \text cl \right if we let x represent the fraction that is 35 cl then the fraction that is 37 cl is represented by 1.00 x the fraction that is 35 cl the fraction that is 37 cl must add up to 1 so the fraction of 37 cl must equal 1.00 the fraction of 35 cl substituting this into the average mass equation we have 35.453 amu x × 34.96885 amu 1.00 − x × 36.96590 amu 35.453 34.96885 x 36.96590 − 36.96590 x 1.99705 x 1.513 x 1.513 1.99705 0.7576 35.453 amu x × 34.96885 amu 1.00 − x × 36.96590 amu 35.453 34.96885 x 36.96590 − 36.96590 x 1.99705 x 1.513 x 1.513 1.99705 0.7576 \begin array ccc \hfill \text 35.453 amu \left x\times \text 34.96885 amu \right +\left \left 1.00-x\right \times \text 36.96590 amu \right \hfill \\ \hfill 35.453 34.96885x+36.96590-36.96590x\hfill \\ \hfill 1.99705x 1.513\hfill \\ \hfill x \frac 1.513 1.99705 =0.7576\hfill \end array so solving yields x 0.7576 which means that 1.00 0.7576 0.2424 therefore chlorine consists of 75.76 35 cl and 24.24 37 cl naturally occurring copper consists of 63 cu mass 62.9296 amu and 65 cu mass 64.9278 amu with an average mass of 63.546 amu

average atomic mass and check naturally occurring isotope ratios using the isotopes and atomic mass simulation the occurrence and natural abundances of isotopes can be experimentally determined using an instrument called a mass spectrometer mass spectrometry ms is widely used in chemistry forensics medicine environmental science and many other fields to analyze and help identify the substances in a sample of material in a typical mass spectrometer figure 5 the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beam that causes the sample s atoms or molecules to become electrically charged typically by losing one or more electrons these cations then pass through a variable electric or magnetic field that deflects each cation s path to an extent that depends on both its mass and charge similar to how the path of a large steel ball bearing rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extent that that of a small steel bb the ions are detected and a plot of the relative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios a mass spectrum is made the height of each vertical feature or peak in a mass spectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specified mass-to-charge ratio since its initial use during the development of modern atomic theory ms has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical analysis in a wide range of applications

protons and neutrons its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom the mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units amu which is referred to as the atomic mass an amu is defined as exactly 1 12 1 12 \frac 1 12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 × 10 −24 g. protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu electrons are light particles with a charge of 1− and a mass of 0.00055 amu the number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number z and is the property that defines an atom s elemental identity the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number and expressed in amu is approximately equal to the mass of the atom an atom is neutral when it contains equal numbers of electrons and protons isotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers isotopes of an element therefore differ from each other only in the number of neutrons within the nucleus when a naturally occurring element is composed of several isotopes the atomic mass of the element represents the average of the masses of the isotopes involved a chemical symbol identifies the atoms in a substance using symbols which are one- two- or three-letter abbreviations for the

guess that the abundances are 9 ne-22 91 ne-20 and only a trace of ne-21 the average mass would be 20.18 amu checking the nature s mix of isotopes shows that the abundances are 90.48 ne-20 9.25 ne-22 and 0.27 ne-21 so our guessed amounts have to be slightly adjusted 14 79.904 amu 16 turkey source 0.2649 of 10.0129 amu isotope us source 0.2537 of 10.0129 amu isotope anion negatively charged atom or
