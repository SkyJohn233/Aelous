food review afternoon tea the capital hotel 22 basil street knightsbridge london foodie explorers the capital hotel london is a five-star hotel located in the heart of knightsbridge and as such ideally situated for a post-harrods shopping treat afternoon tea is a serious business nowadays and we looked forward to what surprises the capital provided we were met at the reception and guided up to the cosy and relaxing lounge peaceful music filled the air and a light breeze drifted through the room perfect we perused the selection of teas available choosing a ceylon and a white needle tea the teas arrived quickly and were well-brewed so no need to wait to enjoy both were delicious with the white needle tea light looking back at what we ate i m glad i picked a light tea it wasn t long before our cakes and savouries arrived the sandwiches included egg cress ham mustard and smoked mackerel p t as well as bacon mushroom tarts/quiche and my favourite warm crumpet with smoked salmon the bread was fresh and the filling/bread ratio was perfect the textures and tastes were devine the bacon mushroom tarts were made with light crisp pastry and the soft delicate finger sandwiches had a tart mustard that provided a welcome contrast to the sweetness to come afternoon tea is often a sweet dainty affair and this was no exception with plenty of sweet treats provided decadent chocolate orange trifle buttery bakewell tart as well as a tart and sweet lemon sponge just when you think it s all over there is more plain and fruit scones are served warm with strawberry jam and devonshire clotted cream the capital hotel have also worked with sipsmith london dry gin to create two afternoon tea cocktails the basil street spritz blackcurrant and hibiscus infused tea and champagne or the capital citrus blend marmalade orange lime and apple juice bohea infused tea and cura ao these sound delicious with the citrus blend making my mouth water afternoon tea with one of these cocktails
