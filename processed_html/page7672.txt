Israel Gay Youth Organization Print Advert By BBDO: Closet | Ads of the World™ Jump to navigation ... Print advertisement created by BBDO, Israel for Israel Gay Youth Organization, within the category: Public Interest, NGO. It’s easier than you think. good job fellas This is great. Really. Great. funny ad, but 8 steps doesn't sound/look easy to me. 8 steps are fine, if you think how much it took to build THAT exact kind of closet... An excellent use of the "come out of the closet" phrase, without actually using it. si fai il mio nome, non ci sono più... *****  Bravo! Wouldn't it be more topical if they just blew it up? great ad....(wish i had it in 1522) "I have no friends, and don't want any." - Michelangelo " The creative person wants to be a know-it-all. He wants to know about all kinds of things: ancient history, nineteenth-century mathematics, current manufacturing techniques, flower arranging, and hog futures... " - Carl Ally, ad exec blowing it up is a good idea if you're from Texas... interesting ad....good. i'm from Texas, and while we do like to blow stuff up, they've already done an incredible job with this execution.  furthermore, explosions already have a tragic history with the region, and i don't think they'd appreciate the joke. Stolen idea. 1/1. Done by Grabarz  &  Partner in Hamburg a few years ago for IKEA. http://www.advertolog.com/paedia/prints/2003/01/04/43677/ The IKEA one is about a store closing; this one is a metaphor for homosexuality, specifically 'coming out of the closet' and telling the world that you're gay. totally different. And a score of 1/1 is still 100%. Shameless. I guess the only way you'll get noticed is accusing people on here of stealing work. Or is some of your work on this site? By that argument I could take the Tide print campaign, redo it with little carpet cleaning men and slap on a carpet cleaning service logo. "Hey it's the same idea but for a different service so it's an original ad"? These ads are 100% identical. The only difference is the logo. So yes it is a stolen idea probably lifted from an awards annual. And that is shameless. "probably lifted from an awards annual." 'Probably' being the operative word. It's one thing to point out the similarities, and another to baselessly accuse the creatives of plagiarism. It happens ALL THE TIME. Are you familiar with every concept that has ever existed so as not to repeat anything similar? Ridiculous. Shameless, guys. Just shameless. I guess paging through old annuals and stealing ideas is the only way you'll ever get noticed. WELL DONE! for a "no copy/paste world day". for a  " no copy/paste "  world day. This ad is gay. Sorry I couldn't help it. isn't that a wardrobe not a closet? Maybe it's an american thing, but our closets are built into our houses. __________________________ http://laurienickerson.com Mmmmmmmmmmmmm...ok. SJB so it's about doing things backwords?
