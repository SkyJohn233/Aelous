piteraq glacier bytes as the 2015 greenland expedition season gets underway i want to comment on the insurance overlap between research and sport expeditions on the ice sheet greenland can be a very windy place the world s fourth fastest observed wind speed 333 km/h was clocked at thule northwest greenland in a march 1972 storm 1 the piteraq or ambush wind is an especially strong type of wind unique to greenland which occurs when katabatic winds align with the regional geostrophic wind field during piteraq events relatively cold and dense air not only flows down from the top of the ice sheet under gravity but is also sucked down by low atmospheric pressure at the coast 2 piteraqs are strongest around the ice sheet periphery especially in southeast greenland adjacent to the icelandic low in april 2013 a few colleagues and i were doing fieldwork on the ice sheet at kan_u in southwest greenland when a piteraq struck southeast greenland our tas_u weather station there recorded sustained winds of just over 150 km/hr during the piteraq 3 since 2007 tas_u has recorded a number of piteraqs some have even been strong enough to knock over or damage the station the april 2013 event which left the tas_u station standing would probably not have been noteworthy if it had not claimed the life of philip goodeve-docker who was just two days into a three-man sport expedition to cross the ice sheet from isortoq to kangerlussuaq 4 mean hourly wind speeds at kan_u and tas_u weather stations during the april 2013 piteraq event inset locations of kan and tas transects as well as other transects in south greenland source van as et al. 2014 the number of annually permitted greenland sport expeditions is perhaps surprisingly high an information request to greenland government by my colleague dirk van as found that during the 2010 to 2012 seasons approximately 78 teams annually undertook sport expeditions in greenland including coastal kayaking of which approximately 24 teams per year were dedicated ice sheet crossings 5 assuming a sport expedition team size of four people that is approximately 100 individuals per year crossing the ice sheet mostly along the 67th parallel the isortoq-kangerlussuaq highway all of these sport individuals are obliged to purchase search and rescue sar insurance while some nationally-funded research expeditions basically just danish and american are permitted to self-insure all other research expeditions have to buy into the same sar insurance occasionally and strictly speaking even just specific members of a research expedition such as persons not employed within the sponsoring nation may be obliged to purchase their own sar map of permitted and non-permitted expedition areas in greenland as well as the approximate location of the isortoq-kangerlussuaq sport route source greenland government in 2011 i received a sar quote of 6200 dkk 900 usd to cover a non-danish member of a danish expedition for just eight days i shudder to think what some colleagues must pay to insure a six person research expedition for a month at the time the round-trip helicopter flight to our ice sheet site cost only about ten times our quote premium meaning that in a zero profit world the underwriters would be recusing approximately 10 of policyholders turns out that is not far off the truth for sport expeditions of the 234 sport expeditions initiated in greenland between 2010 and 2012 sixteen ended in emergency evacuation 5 that is 7 of all greenland sport expeditions the ice sheet teams were evidently better prepared with a lower but still non-trivial evacuation rate of 3 as greenland sar insurance treats research and sport expeditions as functionally equivalent both are technically required to bring more daily calories than even an olympic swimmer might consume the above 6.6a clause obliges a 21 day expedition to bring the equivalent of 30 kg of peanut butter per person source insurance for journeys and expeditions in greenland policy drawn up in cooperation with the danish polar center conditions no 101b for insurance purposes both sport and research expeditions are effectively regarded as having the same safety margin in fact research expeditions often delivered by aircraft with 1000 kg of cargo per person have an inherently higher safety margin than skiers pulling a 200 kg sled i would love to have the comparable evacuation statistic for research expeditions we have such an information request pending with greenland government but i will go out on a limb and guess that the research expedition evacuation rate is not nil but an order of magnitude lower than the sport expedition evacuation this asymmetry in evacuation risk means that when predominately publicly-funded research expeditions buy sar insurance they are effectively subsidizing the sar costs of predominately privately-funded sport expeditions to make an analogy auto insurance rates usually vary between motorcycles and mini-vans in lieu of different insurance premiums for research and sport expeditions perhaps the safety of sport expeditions could at least be further optimized by drawing on ice sheet research not forgetting that reducing sar calls is not just about cost but also about the preservation of life vastly differing resource levels our 2013 research expedition being delivered by lc-130 with two of three pallets left charalampos babis charalampidis and a 2008 sport expedition arriving at our west greenland campsite right this brings us back to piteraqs which should probably rank at the top of sport expedition hazards above the more often cited trio of cold crevasses and polar bears for example if research suggests that the ice sheet flank is windier in the southeast than the southwest east to west crossings isortoq to kangerlussuaq would appear to provide sport teams more ample opportunity to wait for an appropriate weather window before setting upon the relatively piteraq prone southeast flank right now however the majority of crossings 61 are in the opposite direction west to east with sport teams arriving in piteraq alley with no possibility for retreat 5 danish meteorological institute forecasts already include piteraq warnings for greenland coastal towns but while research has made piteraqs eminently predictable from 48 hours away the goodeve-docker expedition was jeopardized within 48 hours of departing isortoq evidently more applied publications and outreach to better communicate such research insight directly to teams is needed so those are some thoughts on how sport and research expeditions are linked by common sar insurance perhaps arguably to the detriment of research expeditions and how the piteraq hazard might be mitigated for sport expeditions unfortunately regional climate model simulations suggest that wind speeds around the ice sheet periphery will increase under climate change 6 meaning that there will likely be more piteraqs in everyone s future i should probably make explicitly clear that these are my own thoughts and not those of my employing institution 1 stansfield j 1972 the severe arctic storm of 8–9 march 1972 at thule air force base
