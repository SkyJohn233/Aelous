and publish this comment on the article by kadi and wiesing the article the german ivf register as an instrument to document assisted reproductive technologies by kadi and wiesing takes a critical look at the structure and work of the german ivf register d.i.r the main issues criticized in their article are the register does not have data from all the ivf centers in germany the datasets on fertility procedures reported to the german ivf register are incomplete collection of data is not exclusively prospective the register only publishes average data for all of germany and does not publish center-specific data the presentation of the data is consistently unsuitable for use by non-specialists although the first four criticisms are not altogether wrong in the opinion of the board of the d.i.r the overall situation is significantly less critical than portrayed in the article the german ivf register was set up in 1982 by various working groups all of which were part of university institutions at the time the fact that at a time when no legal regulations existed these working groups recognized the necessity for data to be collected and analyzed centrally and also that they carried out this work voluntarily and of their own accord can not be praised highly enough since then the d.i.r has existed not just as a voluntary self-motivated instrument for medical quality assurance but also as the largest data collection on assisted reproductive procedures in germany it should also be emphasized that the d.i.r is financed through voluntary contributions paid by centers of reproductive medicine the centers are currently as at 2016 invoiced the sum of 2.20 per documented treatment cycle the work of the elected members of the board and of the members of the board of trustees is entirely unpaid on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the d.i.r a former member of the board stated the foremost task of the german ivf register is to provide a faithful description of procedures carried out using assisted reproductive technologies in germany and their outcomes 1 the d.i.r tries to satisfy these high aspirations inevitably of course the description and evaluation of procedures and their outcomes can only be as good as the collected data in this respect the criticism of kadi and wiesing about the incompleteness of the collected data is not unfounded and the board of the d.i.r is fully aware of this it should be noted however that since the incorporation of the d.i.r as a registered association in 2009 and despite the termination of the agreements on data assessment between ivf centers and the medical association of schleswig-holstein k-sh by the k-sh in 2013 the percentage of participating centers remains extremely high out of a total of 132 ivf centers known to us in germany 131 centers 99.2 are members of the d. i. r. 128 of these centers submitted data to the d.i.r i.e. 97.7 of all members or 97.0 of all centers the three member centers which did not submit their data to the d.i.r were unable to export their data because of compatibility problems with the data capture software at the time of data export but the data has been collected by the centers and the centers will soon pass on this data which will then be included in the 2015 evaluation this means that the d.i.r will then have collected data on 99 of ivf icsi and cryo transfer procedures carried out in germany and will be able to do a scientific evaluation of the data kadi and wiesing pointed out repeatedly and rightly that the most important information for affected couples i.e. the probability that an initiated therapy will be brought to a successful conclusion with the birth of a child can not be clearly established based on the data published by the d. i. r. but this is due to a number of facts the documenting centers do not fully and completely record the course of all pregnancies which occur this is regrettable but this already prompted the board of the d.i.r in 2013 to launch a motivating campaign with the aim of improving the quality of data collection among other things a special evaluation published in the annual d.i.r report for 2013 2 and a number of different lecture events increased membersʼ awareness of the importance of recording these meaningful parameters in addition compared to previous years members received more frequent requests earlier on to export their data on pregnancy outcomes centers with below average numbers of reported pregnancy outcomes were specifically asked to improve their reporting this quality initiative has already begun to bear fruit compared to the year 2012 the mean percentage of pregnancy outcomes reported in 2012 was 84.9 significantly more pregnancy outcomes were documented in 2013 93.4 this means that within the space of just one year the so-called lost-to-follow-up rate more than halved decreasing from 15.1 to 6.6 3 to be able to calculate the actual rate of live births for every initiated treatment cycle all oocytes obtained in the course of a procedure would have to be followed up until transfer and each oocyte would have to be matched to the respective retrieval procedure at oocyte retrieval more oocytes are usually collected and fertilized than are transferred to the patient in a single session these spare fertilized oocytes are usually cryopreserved at the pronuclear stage of development allowing them to be thawed and transferred during a later cycle of treatment this means that several transfer cycles may be carried out after a single oocyte retrieval procedure leading in some cases to the time-delayed birth of several siblings all of which came from the same single oocyte retrieval procedure up to now the d.i.r was not able to evaluate these data as the assignment of transferred embryos to a specific retrieval cycle was technically impossible this was one of several factors which already prompted the d.i.r in 2012 to fundamentally revise the software used for data collection and reporting and triggered the decision to modernize the data structure the software used up to now known as dirdll will be replaced by modern data capture architecture which will allow this question to be answered for the first time the fact that not all recorded cycles are entered prospectively has been known for quite some time it has been the subject of an awareness campaign by the board of the d.i.r since 2013 which employs a number of different measures to motivate the members of the d.i.r to improve the quality of their documentation the authors of the article assert that it can not be precluded that all data is only entered after some delay indicating that this would allow non-prospective procedures to be entered retrospectively as prospective procedures we believe that this allegation is wholly without foundation in the case of non-prospective cycles it is clear that we are looking at a problem arising from process workflows during the organization of treatment cycles in other words there is a problem with the quality of the documentation and not at a deliberate attempt at deception why would a center which took the decision after the d.i.r was incorporated in 2009 to voluntarily report its anonymized data and to pay for this out of its own pocket invest a not insignificant amount of time and energy in laboriously manipulating and corrupting data during data entry the board of the d.i.r considers this to be a completely unfounded insinuation which it strongly repudiates the authors of the article repeatedly blame the d.i.r for the fact that non-prospective data are also included even though the proposed guideline on the implementation of assisted reproductive technologies german medical association 2006 4 specified that data should only be collected prospectively it should first be noted that the cited proposed guideline is not legally binding it will only be incorporated in medical regulations if it is included in the professional code of conduct of the respective medical association of the federal state responsible for the individual ivf center hardly any medical association of a federal state in germany has adopted the proposed guideline unchanged or incorporated it in their medical regulations either parts of it were modified or the respective medical association for example the medical association of berlin did not adopt the proposed guideline at all moreover on its homepage the german medical association has even added a qualifier on the model guideline of the german medical association on the implementation of assisted reproduction german medical association 2006 as follows this guideline has not been adapted to the current legal situation and/or it no longer reflects the current state of knowledge in medical science and technology it can therefore only provide specialists with information if persons are aware of the relevant changes in the legal situation and the changes in the state of knowledge in medical science and technology 5 consequently the authorsʼ reference to this guideline is neither applicable nor expedient with regard to content the d.i.r does indeed face a dilemma as it must decide whether only prospective data should be published or whether non-prospective data should also be included there can be no doubt that if the focus were only on the quality of the documentation it would be preferable if all data were recorded exclusively prospectively on the other hand the d.i.r has set itself the goal of collecting the real data for all treatment cycles evaluating it scientifically and making it publicly available in order to specifically reflect the reality of ivf icsi and cryo transfer procedures in germany that is why we also took the deliberate decision to publish and evaluate data which were not recorded prospectively it should be noted that these evaluations were also explicitly identified as such to allow readers to interpret the results themselves kadi and wiesing point out that the d.i.r provides no information on the success rates for individual centers instead although the d.i.r does have the data it only publishes national data this criticism is as old as the publications of the d. i. r. the board the board of trustees and the office of the d.i.r already weighed in on this issue in the annual report for 2007 i.e. long before the d.i.r was incorporated as a registered association at a time when the d.i.r was still under the aegis of the medical association of schleswig-holstein why canʼt you find statistics on the individual success rates of every single ivf center in germany in the annual report of the d.i.r the notion seems both tempting and reasonable it would be so nice if you could simply take the annual report of the german ivf register look up the ivf centers in your region and read up about their success rates of course you would then opt for the center with the highest reported pregnancy rates after all you would want the best physicians to treat you a couple might be happy to accept a longer distance to travel if for example the pregnancy rates are higher in another german federal state although this may sound simple matters are unfortunately not quite so simple quite apart from the fact that comparative advertising is prohibited to physicians in germany such a top of the pops list or league table would have serious secondary effects it would lead to treating physicians taking great care to treat only those couples with a positive prognosis other couples could potentially be excluded from treatment because their prospects of success would be considered too low which could jeopardize the centerʼs good position in the league table the pressures of such competition could also negatively affect the quality and honesty of the documented data the distortion triggered by a league table of this type would be serious and would ultimately be to the detriment of patients what the german ivf register has been doing for many years is now considered exemplary also by international standards it offers a clear picture of the situation in germany and reflects current standards in germany the range of outcomes is shown openly but without naming specific centers it is an invitation to you as patients to ask your treating physician your treating ivf center about their success rates that is the only place you will receive instructive explanations and the information which you need to understand why the outcomes of the center are what they are this is the only way that will allow you to act as an autonomous patient and make a well informed decision 6 the british hfea which the authors have cited several times as an example of a state-run regulatory body with a compulsory duty to report data on procedures takes a different approach here 7 but it is questionable to what extent the quality of the collected data realistically reflects the conditions there at any rate the data collected there is definitely not prospective while in the d.i.r at least 87.08 of the documented treatment cycles fulfill this criterion 8 moreover the hfea also does not show the individual data of affected couples number of oocytes obtained number and quality of embryos cryopreservation yes/no number of cryopreserved pronuclei/embryos cumulative pregnancy rate/rate of live births per oocyte retrieval procedure/per initiated treatment cycle in our view couples should have a proper discussion with the fertility doctors treating them to obtain a realistic assessment of the probability of success in their individual case it is better if this information is obtained during a doctor patient discussion rather than from an uncritical list of figures and it can not be provided by either the d.i.r nor by a state-run institution such as the hfea kadi and wiesing maintain that the presentation of results in the annual report of the d.i.r authorʼs note is completely unsuitable for non-specialists as it is too complicated the summary for patients published for the first time in 2015 is too short and in addition it is uncritical as the d.i.r is accessible both to non-specialists and to physicians a compromise will of course be necessary but several years ago the d.i.r attempted to summarize the results in a manner comprehensible to non-specialists on 4 printed pages in the d.i.r annual report the annual report for 2007 already considered and answered questions such as what are the prospects in germany of becoming pregnant or giving birth following a procedure with extracorporeal fertilization what are the risks during childbirth following extracorporeal fertilization ivf or icsi with regard to multiple pregnancy or multiple births do the success rates of ivf/icsi therapy vary for women depending on age does the number of transferred embryos affect the probability of success of ivf/icsi treatment and to what extent does the reason for carrying out the procedure indication affect the success rate 6 this seems to have escaped kadi and wiesing in fact the summary cited by the authors which apparently first appeared in 2015 and which was additionally considered too short and uncritical did not merely aim to inform patients but primarily aimed to provide journalists with a short and concise description of certain key facts nevertheless the d.i.r accepts the criticism and will be presenting up-to-date information relevant for patients in its next annual report in a manner comprehensible for non-specialists finally we would like to quote from the book published to mark the 10th anniversary of the d.i.r in which mr. dahncke the developer of the original data structure of the german ivf register at the medical association of schleswig-holstein summarized the developments at the time the current board of the d.i.r would also like to take this opportunity to once again thank mr. dahncke for his consistently constructive work the summary hits the nail on the head and in our opinion still holds true today after almost 20 years of data collection by the d.i.r 10 years ago the board of trustees of the dir defined the goals the path was not always easy progress was not always discernible at some stages there was an impression that matters had stalled when we look back now we see a very long not always straightforward but ultimately successful path towards the goal of optimal data collection the path may never reach the goal but it will constantly come closer 1 in our opinion it is highly questionable whether a state-run body which kadi and wiesing consider to be inevitable or an institute under state supervision would handle the task better on the contrary the work of the d.i.r as a scientific register and the quality assurance initiative of the medical associations of the german federal states qsrepromed should be jointly capable of dealing with the task itself working on behalf of physicians patients journalists and interested non-specialists it has been demonstrated in the past for example in france that medical self-government and the chartered medical profession can achieve more than state-imposed compulsory administration
