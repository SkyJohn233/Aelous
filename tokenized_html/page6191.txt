dr. elaine heffner children do listen opinion austin american-statesman austin tx a familiar complaint from parents is that children do n't listen.\ what they usually mean is that a child does n't do what they tell him to do often it refers to routines like get dressed pick up your toys finish your lunch and more of the same so the real meaning of children not listening is that they do n't obey us if they would just do as they are told life would be so much easier as it is everything turns into a struggle parents begin to feel that there must be some magic that can make it stop or worry that something is wrong with a child who seems always to defy them this came to mind when a father shared some of his young daughter 's school work with me a classroom teacher gave the children a motto with an assignment to write about how it might apply to them the one that struck me had to do with the golden rule the assignment was write about the ways you follow the golden rule.\ what follows is exactly what the child wrote errors in spelling and grammar included i follow the golden rule because i treat people with the same respect i want to be treated with and i stand up for other people that aer yunger on the bus i help people that have a problem i stand up for my self when i need to i am kind to others i treat people nicely i help people crros in front of the bus i help people with math i help people spell words i help people that need to be helped i help people do there work when they need to i help people do there homework.\ is this child 's self-description an accurate picture of her actual behavior not really what makes it interesting is not only that it shows she understands the concept of the golden rule more important it shows the kind of behavior to which she aspires she has taken in certain ideas relating to the kind of person who would be valued the kind of person she would like to be parents often express amazement when hearing of their children 's exemplary behavior at someone else 's home or when they find that a school report reflects no sign of troublesome behavior at home this disparity is another example that children have taken in parental expectations of behavior and demonstrate children 's ability to meet such expectations in situations other than at home if children clearly know the right\ way to behave why do n't they behave that way at home one reason is that controlling impulses giving up your own wishes in order to meet the requests of others is still hard work for young children often when children start school they are exhausted when they come home functioning in a group and exercising control over their behavior takes great effort children may rebel at exerting such effort all day at home also an important part of development is that children begin to assert themselves at times they develop a sense of their own identity by acting in opposition to their parents they may behave defiantly when parents seem to disregard their own emerging ideas and wishes which differ from what parents want the child referred to earlier wrote my dad has a positive attitude because he is always there for me and is persistent.\ perhaps she has offered an important message for parents with persistence in your expectations and a positive attitude your children at some point will show you they do listen elaine
