Explorer ' s Grant IV | Huckberry You choose the adventure and friend you're taking. We'll hook you up with an all-expense paid trip and $2,000 in gear. "I haven't been everywhere, but it's on my list."  â€” Susan Sontag We understand that fidgety, wanderlust feeling all too well. There's a whole lotta world to explore and not a lot of time to do it. It's what drove my ski buddy Rich and me to quit our corporate jobs eight years ago and found Huckberry, an online retailer that's equal parts store, magazine, and inspiration. One of our favorite traditions is the Huckberry Explorer's Grant, and this year we've brought our most adventurous contest back in full force by partnering with four of our Ambassadors and  Popular Mechanics  to give away one soul-stirring, all-expense paid adventure for you and a friend plus $2,000 in gear (a $10,000 total value ðŸ˜±). Read on for details and a chance to cross a truly epic adventure off your list.
