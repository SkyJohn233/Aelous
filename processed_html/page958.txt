The terminal | Sharon S Son | montrosepress.com Copyright ©  var today = new Date()var year = today.getFullYear()document.write(year) 2019 • Wick Communications Terms of Use   |   Privacy Policy It was Tuesday morning and the plane had just touched down at Denver International Airport right on time. My trek from Chicago back to Montrose had a stop in Denver to switch planes before getting back home. Everything was perfect. Until I switched my phone off of airplane mode and immediately was bombarded by a series of texts from United Airlines. One: “Your flight to Montrose is canceled due to weather. We’ve rebooked you on an alternate flight.” “OK, not the end of the world,” I thought while waiting to get off the plane. Second text, 10 seconds later: “We’ve rebooked you for today on our 7:55 p.m. nonstop flight to Montrose, arriving at 9 p.m.” End. “Wait, what?” I questioned the text out loud. “What am I going to do all day?” Suddenly the 2004 Tom Hanks’ movie “The Terminal” popped into my mind — you know, the one where he’s trapped in the airport terminal for months. Being trapped at DIA is becoming tradition for me as I experienced the exact same thing last spring. “Well,” I told myself. “Let’s make a day of it.” Recognizing the humor of the situation, I decided it would be funny to document my day in the life of being stranded at the airport in real time, so I transcribed it all through my phone. The following is my story: 10:06 a.m.: I’m still in a bit of disbelief. “This can’t be happening again,” I tell myself. It’s the third time in two years I’ve had a connecting flight in Denver from Montrose, and have had it postponed by eight-plus hours. 10:14 a.m.: This needs to be processed with coffee. I proceed upstairs to Caribou Coffee and order a large vanilla latte. 10:17 a.m.: This coffee is amazing! 10:20 -11 a.m.: My phone is going nuts. My wife and work colleagues are calling or texting me. My wife informs me of the crazy winds in Montrose. 11:02 a.m.: Bathroom break. It was a large coffee after all. 11:03 a.m.: There’s a line in the restroom and part of it is closed off, so everyone is forced to wait in line for a stall; urinals unavailable. My turn arrives quickly and I go to the third stall from the left and when I turn around to to close the door, the guy behind me in line has departed the line and has come with me the 15 feet to stall No. 3. 11:04 a.m.: “What are you doing?” I ask, with the door closed. He replies by saying, “I only use that stall in this airport. It’s mine. I make sure people don’t mess it up.” Confused and weirded out, I said three others are now open and he tells me, angrily, “I love that one! I watch people who are in there.” 11:05 a.m.: Not worth it to me, I decide to exit the stall and bathroom for that matter to get away from the creeper. I’ll find another bathroom without a resident weirdo inside. 11:07 a.m.: More calls from the office. 11:11 a.m.: I engage in a game of “Celebrity Sightings,” a game I made up where you people watch for folks who resemble celebrities. 11:12 a.m.: Already I’ve spotted the doppelgängers of Tom Hanks, Lisa Kudrow, Von Miller and Kid Rock. The person resembling the latter is sporting a white tank, dirty blonde hair, goatee, blue jeans, tattoos and more. OK, there’s part of me that thinks it’s the actual Kid Rock. 11:42 a.m.: My former news editor from North Carolina, Tia, calls me. We have a good conversation. Noon: My father-in-law calls me. We talk about my flight delay and other things. 12:21 p.m.: My dad calls and asks if I’m back in Montrose. I tell him I’m trapped at DIA until 9 o’clock that night. He responds by saying he hates the stupid weather and airlines, and I tell him I’m looking at it like the glass is half full. He reminds me it’s only 12:22. I cry (not really). I tell him thanks for being so positive (in a sarcastic tone). 1 p.m.: I decide it’s time for lunch. Chick-fil-a is open! 1:50 p.m.: I decide to rent a movie off of iTunes. My choice? “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.” 2:25 p.m.: “You still have a long way to go,” my wife says, via text. “I’m just hoping you make it back today and they don’t cancel it altogether … it is supposed to die down, but hasn’t yet.” Me: Straight-faced emoji. 2:55 p.m.: “Does your flight leave Denver at 9 or does it get to Montrose at 9?” my wife asks via text. I soon find out my flight is scheduled for 7:55 p.m. and get excited. Success!  An email has been sent to   with a link to confirm list signup.             Error!

The big news of the day, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning expect Monday. 2:57 p.m.: The movie has downloaded only 8 percent because of a poor Wi-Fi connection, but I start it anyway. 3:02 p.m.: A Caucasian male teen walks by where I’m sitting in the terminal: “Yo dog, girls got to have a piece of this,” he says to another. Me: I didn’t hear anything before or after this kid’s comments, but I roll my eyes. 3:58 p.m.: The movie download is at 25 percent and abruptly stops and gives me no prompt to redownload. So I call iTunes support, and a nice guy named Rob gives me a hand. 4:48 p.m.: A bird or a bat, I can’t tell, flies by where I’m sitting in the terminal upstairs near the Hudson News. I continue watching the movie, which has downloaded 50 percent. The movie download stops again. 4:49 p.m.: Wait, Brookstone is in the airport? 4:52 p.m.: I hear a woman’s voice over the sound of my headphones, she appears to be older, sitting next to me. “I told him I don’t give a f***, honestly. They can’t make me give a sh*t. I’m the boss.” I carry on with my movie. 4:54 p.m.: “Seriously, though, think I give a da**? I told them I didn’t,” I hear the woman yell into her phone. “Nobody f***s with me and gets away with it. I’ll roll on them.” 4:55 p.m.: Note to self: Don’t do anything to bother the woman right next to me. 4:56 p.m.: The movie starts downloading again and finally completes. Now I can watch it in peace for the next hour-and-a-half or so before I finally get home. I’m happy, I’m relieved, I’m enjoying my movie for the next five minutes and telling myself how I made it through the day at the airport when ... 5:02 p.m.: “Your flight to Montrose is canceled due to weather,” a text suddenly appears on my phone. “Please see a United representative for assistance.” 5:03 p.m.: Then comes a text from a friend: “Well, you’ve been there all day but at least you’ll be home soon.” 5:04 p.m.: “Soon is a relative term,” I tell myself.
