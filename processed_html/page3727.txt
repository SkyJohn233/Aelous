Coach Dwayne Williams told the  Jamaica Observer North  &  East  he was particularly impressed with the showing from the boys' section on the opening day. We did above expectations, as we expected to dominate the girls. But after Monday we noticed that we could topple the boys, so the coaching staff spoke to them after we looked at the numbers going into the final, and they came through,  he said. He noted that the platform is set for Boys' and Girls' Athletics Championships from March 26-30 in Kingston, and the Carifta Games in the Cayman Islands from April 20-22. We are happy that we retained the title. We are now looking for, them going, on to the Boys and Girls Championships, and a few making it to the Carifta trials and Carifta meet. We do not have an excellent surface [for training] like others, but we make do with what we have and the weather was kind to us this year,  Williams said. Edwin Allen High and Calabar High, are respective girls and boys champions. Now you can read the Jamaica Observer ePaper anytime, anywhere.
