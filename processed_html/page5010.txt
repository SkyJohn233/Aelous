Are Marriott Rewards Platinum Elite members... Are Marriott Rewards Platinum Elite members provided complimentary access to the Griffin Club regardless of class of room booked or do you specifically have to book a Club Level room? Thank you for your question. We truly appreciate your loyalty to Marriott and have wonderful offerings for our Marriott Reward guests. The Griffin Club is different than a concierge lounge and would have to be reserved separately. Please contact our resort for full details on both our Griffin Club offerings, availability and pricing as well as details on Platinum offerings at our resort. We look forward to seeing you soon! For my stay, the Griffin Club was an additional $75 per person; not per room. Breakfast is a decent spread; lunch is always sandwich meat, bread, small salad bar and a soup. Evening is a few items to grab; and they have a chef-attended station with a sampling of something different each night; a good snack but if you are really hungry this just won ' t do. Seemed to be unlimited cocktails, so if you are drinker, may be a decent investment...? I was not automatically provided complimentary access to the Griffin Club, So my best guess would be you have to book a Club Level Room.
