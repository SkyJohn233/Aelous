As a very special treat for all our customers at the naughty pig, Chef Daniel has devoted an entire section to house-made charcuterie. If you aren ' t familiar with the term  " charcuterie, "  it is a French word meaning cured and/or prepared meats. Chef Daniel was fortunate enough to spend a number of days at the Benton Smokehouse (World Famous Benton Hams  &  Bacon) learning from the master himself, Allen Benton. Hence, please come and experience Chef Daniel ' s house cured  &  smoked specialty bacon. Naughty Pig Bacon is always in constant rotation with new and exciting flavors, and is always cut to order.
