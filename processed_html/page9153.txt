Current Resident : &# xA0; A lovely residential town with a rural feel yet still close to more populated areas where there are shops and things to see and do. Friendly, quality people. Great schools. Beautiful surroundings with hiking, trails, kayaking, and other outdoor activities in our backyard. Quiet small town feel. Read  7 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I &# x2019;ve lived in South Burlington for 15 out of the 19 years I &# x2019;ve been on this earth other and I honestly love it despite having experienced cities and towns in multiple other states. It &# x2019;s a small town there isn &# x2019;t a whole lot around here but it &# x2019;s a great place to grow up I would say, it &# x2019;s very green as well trees are everywhere. There &# x2019;s no shortage of hiking paths and scenic routes throughout the mountains of the state which is something I &# x2019;ve grown to really admire, you can &# x2019;t get that in most any other state and here in Vermont it &# x2019;s literally everywhere. The town has definitely been modernized but in such a way that Mother Nature compliments it and I really admire that, the only complaint I would have is the amount of potholes in our roads. Other than that if you enjoy small town life, a friendly community, and nature I would say South Burlington is the town for you! Read  29 Reviews Works Here : &# xA0; Williston is a pretty good area in Vermont.  There are a handful of shops that range from sports to clothes to art, and plenty of groceries.  The local library is great.  There are also some short hikes that are very pretty and relatively easy. Read  5 Reviews Former Resident : &# xA0; Shelburne was the best place to grow up - very safe, friendly small town vibe. It is a 10 minute drive to Burlington, right on the lake and has a cute central area with small local shops and restaurants. Shelburne Farms is a must see.

Downtown Burlington is always filled with life and excitement: there is always something interesting going on! If I could do it all over again, I would pursue a summer internship in the area so that I could live in Burlington during the summer as well. Vermont is beautiful all year round but there is nothing like spending a summer in Vermont. Burlington is a biking/long-boarding friendly town so I always feel safe when I take my board or bike out to do some shopping or cruise around town. The lake at the bottom of the hill (Lake Champlain) offers great views, a wonderful spot for relaxation, fishing and even swimming. In the future I see the housing infrastructure improving, as most of the homes in Burlington are old are due for reconstruction/refurbishing.

Jericho has lots of old historical areas to visit which are really neat and unique to that town. It has some restaurants and a new market in town which has good choices of local food. Jericho is a very safe town little to no break ins around, and people are very friendly and family oriented. There are lots of events that also go on in the town too. Jericho has a very tight knit community if you need help people will be very willing to help you out.  Read  3 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Middlebury is a excellent place to raise a family! The schools are amazing! And it is very safe! They also have free public transit that gets you almost anywhere in the state if you want. The people are very healthy here!

Middlebury ranks very high statistically, with being one of the best places in the country for families, as well as Vermont being statistically ranked the # 1 place in the country for safety, education, health care, families, and best place where kids have the best childhoods!  Middlebury is wonderful place to live! Read  18 Reviews Former Resident : &# xA0; The first time I arrived in Burlington, Vermont, I was about 11 years old. In 2006, I never knew English and so it was difficult to communicate with my classmates. Thank God, Burlington was a very welcoming community, they guided me and helped me through my biggest obstacles. Before learning English, it was always difficult for me to speak, but after being involved in the communities of Burlington. Thanks to them, I am today a poet who likes to speak at the microphone, to help others find their voice. To encourage others and let them know, they are not alone. The Burlington community is here for you and they will help you with everything you need. Without the Burlington community, I would never have found my voice. I am proud to represent Burlington, Vermont. Burlington is my second home and I come from South Sudan. It ' s great to be here and happy to have a voice. Thank you! Burlington for everything, one love. Read  62 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I ' ve enjoyed growing up here! Small, but not too small; We have lots of small town traditions, but we have some of the benefits of a larger town (technically we are the 5th biggest city in VT I think!).  Lots of good programs for kids and families. Read  18 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; North Bennington is a wonderful village community. The only downside with the state of Vermont is the lack of diversity. Read  1 Review Current Resident : &# xA0; I love Essex Junction. It ' s a small town, where you ' re constantly seeing familiar faces. That said, we have enough people in our community to have a very strong school system. Essex High School is currently the second largest high school in Vermont (second to Champlain Valley Union) and offers such great opportunities. For students interested in the arts, the Academy of Visual and Performing Arts offers internship and capstone opportunities. The same type of thing is offered to scientists and mathematicians in the STEM Academy. EHS also has great school spirit, wonderful teachers, and lots of AP classes for students to challenge themselves. Read  24 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Colchester is a wonderful family town. It has several different beaches being right next to the lake, a great school system from elementary to high school (there ' s also several pre-schools that offer amazing opportunities to younger children!), and tons of local businesses from Sam Mazza ' s to The Village Scoop! Colchester has several parks that allow children to engage in local sports leagues or just have fun. I ' m so lucky to have grown up in such a great town! Read  45 Reviews Niche User : &# xA0; My experience living in Burlington, Vermont has been more than I could ever ask for. What I enjoy most about Burlington is the community as a whole. Everyone seems to care about each other and when you walk say downtown, so many people are there enjoying what Burlington has to offer. Whether it be holding the door open for someone, or a simple smile, the citizens of Burlington seem to care about the quality of life here. What I also love about Burlington is the land itself. The green mountains and Lake Champlain are two of many aspects of Burlington that contribute to its beauty. For the future, I can only see Burlington getting a healthier, cleaner, and even more comfortable/safe place to live. Read  18 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I love the mountains, the views, the sunsets, the maple creamies, and the small population which creates a sense of strong community. Local small businesses aren ' t dominated by big corporations so you can experience lots of different and unique things. Read  4 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; The ONE is arguably one of the most diverse sections of Burlington. It contributes great culture to Burlington with many stores and shops owned by refugees. Read  12 Reviews Niche User : &# xA0; Luckily where I live there is very little crime. Now a days crime is becoming more frequent so like other places we have the occasional crimes of burglary but it ' s not a normal thing to always be worried about. In the more urban areas the crime is higher like in most states. Police are very responsive even out in the rural areas. I overall don ' t have concerns about my safety.
