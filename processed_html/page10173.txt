How to clear 13-5 without casualties? No Lisa. : Sdorica I suppose we can cheese the Poison with Lisa’s AoE heal. But I don’t have Lisa. Any suggestion? Thanks Angelia-Random Black- Roger with Hestia and Lio advisor. >Roger 2b Angelia 2b for big shield on Roger, you only need to cure heal backline. And poison can &# x27;t finish you (you can &# x27;t die because of poison). >Also, I would like to advise you to go to <a href="https: /www.reddit.com/r/Sdorica/comments/7eqqz6/watchers_guidebook_questions_megathread/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Watchers &# x27; Guidebook  &  Questions Megathread . Please making new thread only when you want a long and detailed discussion. Dylan (Gold), Tica (White), Dagger (Black), and Angel (Advisor). Give Dylan every round Shield with Angel. Tica 1 Block in Dagger than 2 times 1 Block with Dagger. After a bit Dylans passive will help you keep the endless delaying with Daggers 1 Block up and the boss gets no turns. Daybreak Angelia, Fatima, Golemwaltz. Advisor: Hestia Maintain armor at least 4.5k during the first type of attack Don &# x27;t bother with healing as poison won &# x27;t kill you. On the second type of attack, when, the enemy starts giving tear, use Hestia to one of your character, either attack or recover armor for your team. On the last type of attack, well, this will be a single target attack, just use Hestia to whichever was targeted. tl;dr Always maintain 4.5k armor and make sure Hestia is on your team. I managed to clear using this combi: Pang, Yangbo, Puggi Advisor: Lio, Angelia SP(can be replaced by Theodore I think) Key idea is to use Puggi’s one block skill to nerf C-15 Boss. With 2 stack of exhaust, it deals around 1.4k damage. Always keep Pang with one stack of Damage deduction while Boss is attacking,  with Puggi 1B, the Boss will only deal 460 damage on Pang, i can then focus on other characters more. Keep the teams HP above 2k, by using Lio Advisor Skill, Puggi 2B And Angelia(SP)’s tank up. With careful planning(always keep 1 white block before Boss last round) and some luck, I am able to clear the stage without casualty within 80 rounds. I think Angela SP is replaceable by Theodore as the the cool down time of their advisor skill is similar and they are both defensive in skill nature. Position: Gold Passive: If have vigilance, if succesfully dodge an attack, grant allies 3 turns enhance(?), and if hit by an enemy attack, grant allies 3 turns rage Advisor: Upon player turn, if hp less than 30%, grant ally 2 stacks vigilance. 1o: grant self 5 turns vigilance, reset front row enemy cooldown. 3o: true damage all enemies, trigger black and white ally ' s 1o. 4o: grant self 2 stacks vigilance and taunt, grant all enemies exhaust, reset all enemies cooldown Source : Discord What the heck is this skillset,she effectively make Lazer even more obsolete,and free enhance and rage to allies,free chaining in 2o,4o synergies do well with 1o.She ' s OP,but in a powercreep kind of OP,I ' m scared now. Edit : Her 2o is now 3o according to new leak,so that make her a bit more balanced,but still pretty absurd kit. 8.0k Watchers 27 Watchers on Duty Dec 6, 2015 Cake Day
