Over this time she has been working towards completing her PhD focussing on the use of clovers and lucerne in modern farming systems.  Anna’s main area of interest is the use of alternative forages, such as legumes and herbs, as a means of allowing farmers to intensify sustainably. More work is needed to optimise agronomy and feeding strategy for these forages so that they are viable options for farmers. Through the work with AHDB dairy Anna has conducted a large-scale project to improve the near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) analysis available for clover-grass silages and also conducted experiments to improve the knowledge on growing and feeding lucerne. This has allowed her to visit and speak with farmers all over the UK about their experiences with legume crops.  Copyright   2019 AHDB All Rights Reserved. Visit  www.ahdb.org.uk
