shin oct 03 2019 8:36 am way better than the movie and the cast was amazing especially the second lead couple dannah young aug 25 2019 1:43 am this is my favorite drama of all time it will be one i ll be watching every year lee min ki and seo hyun jin had my emotions all over the place and i am so in love with them would be super excited if they made another series together daisy aug 17 2019 11:21 am there are some drunk scenes/acting style similar to my love from the star although the female lead is a good actress sometimes i wonder if she was trying to copy jun ji hyun in this drama although both lead females have the same occupation celebrities in their dramas daisy aug 17 2019 11:17 am it is soooooooooooooooooooooo dragging it is hard to finish i am also realizing the kdrama cliches through this show and people might get sick of the usual kdrama template someday i hope writers will stop making coos look as if they re not working zainab jul 25 2019 5:53 am i did n't like the film so i 'm wondering if this drama is worth watching .. saranim jul 05 2019 2:42 pm hello good and light drama started well actors are all very good for me it was a bit long though they could have ended the story at 12 or 14 episodes at most it dragged so much i could n't feel a lot of chemistry between the leads too bad.but enjoyed it all in all.ps ra mi ran appeared in one episode i was so impressed once again by her acting she made me cry loved her in reply 1988 skukian jul 04 2019 10:59 am highly recommended this is one of those rare dramas where you fall in love with all the characters it has the best cast the plot although sounds stupid is not that bad as we get further into the drama it was funny romantic and a completely satisfying drama.. and i really love how they did n't rush the ending.. they took their own sweet time to give us a satisfactory ending overall it 's a pretty interesting drama that is definitely worth a watch.. 8/10 miss t jun 24 2019 1:42 am before i comment on the drama i must say i loved k-will 's ost for this drama been listening to that song over and over on to the drama the actors did well and i would have loved to see more scenes for the second couple their chemistry was just on point i am growing to love seo hyun-jin she is just so talented and cant wait for her next drama i loved her so much in another miss oh that she made me watch this and i was not disappointed as i was watchin i loved how lee min-ki 's character was so strong and manly so i though this was going to be one of the few kdramas where the male lead didnt cry but come ep 14 he cried like a baby i think he would have shown his love without crying i didnot get why he was crying that hard and why he was so emotional but other than that it was definitly one of the best dramas for me for 2018 t jun 23 2019 8:28 am the best drama of 2018 i love lee min ki 's acting the cast is just perfect everyone played their roles really well a must watch macoy jun 09 2019 5:15 pm fan of seo hyun-jin through and through funny great drama daisy jun 08 2019 11:18 am i am currently on the 3rd ep but there are already some questionable scenes in ep 2 how did they pass through the immigration when she changed or is it because where they went was within korea so there is no need to pass through the immigration in ep 3 how did she filmed the han se gye for today if her phone is with the man crazyikfan jun 03 2019 10:58 am i did not expect this drama to be sooooooooo good .i enjoyed this thoroughly.fell in love with lee min ki 3btw what are the cars they are driving kept me wondering lovely may 20 2019 4:11 pm the lead pair or side pair are so damn cute i love this drama so damn much never get bored even when i rewatched this drama lovely may 20 2019 4:08 pm i love this drama so much the chemistery between the female lead and the male lead is really great i enjoyed watching this drama even the story line is weird but this drama can make me cry like a baby i love them han sekye and seo do jae hope they can be pair in others drama or maybe the next series ♡ lucy may 07 2019 6:42 pm i love this drama no matter what its entertaining for me i enjoyed watching it alot frequency freedom may 06 2019 6:46 am i love jung joo-hwan/lee tea-ri character anne r apr 29 2019 4:12 am i loved this series especially the main song they play very stirring should have subtitles for it at least once this is only my second asian series the english subtitles are a little off as they re quite formal and sometimes obscure but i loved the relationship of the main characters i hope there will be a second series. ❤️ fafa apr 25 2019 1:31 pm the changing appearance is only a metaphor for changing hearts or moods or feelings at least that 's what i think otherwise this story would totally bunkers and sorry to say thin but the female lead needs to work on her acting skills a llllllloooottttt farah apr 23 2019 10:28 am i read the synopsis looks great but when i watched it just boring with the female lead and male lead story i always skip some of the scene and i hope more scene of kang sa ra and ryu eun ho they are looks so good and cute couple well at least it can heal with the couples of kang sa ra and ryu eun ho i even hope to see them also in the end of the drama but of course it will be show just the lead actor and actres so sad kang sa ra looks so beautiful with her long hair in this drama i remember her antagonis acting in i can hear your voice i hope i can see her again very soon in another good drama as the female lead giana apr 17 2019 11:25 am this drama way good but it hard plot holes i gould have like them tp focus more on the powers the female lead had and why or how she got them you ca n't get that all of a sudden without giving a proper explanation and what about her father they should have made her father be the one who had this power in the first place and she inherited them that would have been believable ikonic apr 05 2019 12:24 am i want to see more of lee min ki oppa being a main lead please give him another role so we can fall in love with him more cg unnie apr 02 2019 8:28 am i just ca n't get enough of

have to say thank you for stellar thanks for the song jajaha dec 09 2018 5:00 pm what a drama can t stop replaying the cute scenes with the main leads together even though i had completed watching this drama it s really rare to see good chemistry between leads in korean dramas the storyline is so-so but thankfully the cast saved this show anyone else here kind to recommend good romcom dramas like this with good chemistry between the leads and i got to say seo hyun jin is so damn pretty i can t believe that i didn t watch any of her dramas before as this is the first time i had seen her acting but sad to say this is her best show as i couldn t get into any of her past dramas after watching this nicoleta dec 07 2018 5:45 pm beautiful inspiring jaja dec 07 2018 10:00 am i am not a fan of seo hyunjin and lee minki.but i fell in love with them in this drama the story plot is typical but the writernim is brilliant in creating characters of such.it may be unrealistic that a person can change form but miraculously i love the premise of the story.the chemistry between them were amazing plus wonderful osts i would say the best rom-com drama of 2018 orion dec 05 2018 8:36 pm i really love this drama the chemistry between the leads is crazy // noni dec 03 2018 9:38 pm this drama has such a beautiful message about self love and self acceptance there were so many beautiful moments and just when you thought there might be a bit of kdrama cliched moments they transform into something beautiful beautiful is the only word i can use to describe this drama just beautiful love love love this drama one of the best for 2018 sohyun dec 02 2018 8:39 pm really really love the whole story as in no boring scenes i 've watched it twice so love 3 arlene nov 28 2018 8:05 am i love it 3 3 3 j nov 26 2018 4:59 am a surprising find did n't really expect much it was a bit predictable in the start but great acting great lines and great values i love how they emphasize messages like loving your inner beauty and not just the outer shell also that everything has a purpose anyone thought that reporter park is woo min 's boyfriend ps credits to moon woo-jin pls he 's such a talented child actor just adorable lot1 nov 26 2018 12:27 am bad storyline but good lead chemistry anita nov 25 2018 8:28 am aww i 'll miss this drama it was the only drama ive watched this past few months simce i really couldnt find anything worthwhile love the ending although i really thought they willl pair woo mi and joo hwan so sad they were kinda cute but somethings bothering me though.. is joo hwan gay in here tae irene forever nov 25 2018 12:19 am i cry a lot at episode 10 who else rumana806 nov 22 2018 2:27 pm just love this drama.such a beautiful storyline.each and every single character justified their roles.even the kinhkang..one of the best dramas of 2018 autumn nov 22 2018 2:17 pm best drama i 've watched this year seo hyun jin is an excellent actress i feel the pain whenever she cries from oh hae young to this drama.. i love the second couple lee da hee is very pretty and a good actress too casting was perfect good job to you all papau nov 22 2018 8:42 am seo hyun jin so beautiful in this dramahsk sdj n ksr just beautiful inside stellar nov 22 2018 8:30 am to those who are looking for the eng song the title is run by 2morro and yes i actually went out of my way to listen carefully to the parts when the song was played and searched the lyrics on google apparently it was sung by 2morro the one who sang their ost soundtrack part 5 the love inside which turned out to be a korean band/singer probably explains why lots of people had a hard time looking for it yeoreum nov 21 2018 7:55 pm han se kye my hero my sunshine will miss you so much tttt let nov 21 2018 6:38 pm seo hyun-jin is insufferable in this role sometimes i really wondered if she had any gray matter in her skull i d have tolerated the plot if it wasn t her the last episodes were a pain would not recommend anna nov 21 2018 11:27 am han se kye will be one of my favourite character when se kye cried i cried when se kye laughed i laughed.thanks to seo hyun jin who made han se kye 's character was live woo mi nov 21 2018 11:03 am i 'm a bit upset with the ending because they did n't even show us who woo mi boyfriend is i feel you eun ho ya.. tiff nov 21 2018 10:46 am perfect from the writers to the directors the staff the settings the storyline its perfect casting of roles lee min ki and seo hyun jin fighting and its soundtracks i may forget something to mention but overall it was perfect this is the first korean drama that i love all the characters whether the bad or the good one the first drama that im so inlove with all its soundtracks and lastly the first drama that made an impressive impact to myself i can t say anything else the beauty inside korean drama is so perfect and i m still loss for words on how to describe this drama because describing it as perfect is not enough from episode 1 to 16 i can say this is a drama above perfection kim nov 21 2018 6:07 am what an amazing drama it was like a full package theres so many touching and funny moments but there are also heartbreaking moments the actors portrayed their characters so well the pace of the drama was perfect it didnt feel rushed and it was n't slow at all writers did a great job the chemistry between the leads were off the roof the ending is absolutely beautiful too it truly made me feel like i will miss every single character abcde nov 20 2018 10:55 am definitely my favourite drama of the year finally the kdrama lords granted me some drama worth waiting for every weeki get the ideas of loving the inner beauty of human not just the exterior but i 've been wondering this all the time i 've been watching it how about when she is pregnant hahaha hyeon nov 19 2018 3:00 am seo hyun jin-ssi has to do a movie in 2019 and return to dramaland soon kdramalover nov 17 2018 10:03 am i still ca n't accept in ep02 when seo do jae trying to open se gye 's phone he successfully opened it for me it still very rude attitude when you open someone belonging without her permission dionat nov 16 2018 11:35 pm we need preview for the next eps steph nov 16 2018 3:47 am i have watched the movie where his is based from and i can say that i love what the writer and the director did on this series i love the movie but i also love this i 've watched the movie for a couple of times but the take on this one is so different and having the woo jin role return to one form and looks makes it a whole lot different and less heavy.i am so looking forward to the last 2 episodes of this series seo hyun jin slayed that role i always feel like tearing up whenever she cries and oh her eyelashes are so long i can help but stare she has a beautiful pair of eyes and it 's so expressive and lil bit spoiler sorry my heart broke on the last episode when seo do jae broke down because of han se gye i lost it i wish they would still be together coz i really felt so sad when sdj cried he never really cried when he got diagnosed with prosopagnosia and when he does because of their break up i just ca n't help but be sad it was their destiny and yet it 's a sad one so far this is the best drama i 've watched with all the reasons laid out like that you can understand where each character is coming from and you ca n't help but sympathize i just want their characters to be happy ㅠ^ㅠ irene.nd nov 15 2018 10:57 pm besides of the story what i love the most of this drama are 1 seo hyun jin lee da hee 's fashion style especially hyun jin 's alexander mcqueen clothes in episode 13 and 2 kingkang who would n't love that pretty and smart doggy kiesha nov 14 2018 8:47 pm ilove seo hyun jin and lee min ke

interesting and funny all of people in this drama is so good in acting and suitable a oct 23 2018 9:55 pm now that i 've watched up to episode 6 i think the show is hitting its stride each new transformation brings something new charming and comedic to the table so even though the main couple are together now i 'm not afraid of the plot getting stale also been loving all the cameos so far i especially liked kim min suk 's role as the high school male se gye it 's amazing how he studied her mannerisms and method of talking do oct 23 2018 7:50 am han se kye i can not stop looking at her i 've seen her few dramas before but i do n't know why but she 's an angel here ❣️ mari oct 20 2018 8:49 am o.m.g ca n't describe how much i love this drama it 's been a long time since i last watch a korean drama that is currently on air i usually wait for the drama to end before watching it on marathon but this drama just got me hooked let 's see if this drama can get into my list of must-repeat-watching i came from the movie the movie was beautiful honestly i did n't expect anything from this drama because many things are changed compared to the movie but still for the time being the drama is beautiful though a different kind of beautiful from the movie i would recommend this drama to be watched p/s the ost is good too especially by vincent and davichi 3 sari oct 19 2018 11:30 am i really love this drama as much as i love the movie version i love how they flip the story with the same conflict the casting are great i just love this so much how they change it sometimes there are times that when some drama are having a new version it always sucks to the point that you cant watch that version but for this this is what you call a good drama version i cant stop watching this i hope they made it little longer jaliper oct 19 2018 7:16 am ahn jae-hyeon and lee min ki are two of my top fave actors i originally watch it because of them but deym that story is soooo good rendi oct 18 2018 11:42 pm lee min ki is a good choice playing this kind of role just like in bcs this is my first life drama the same cold inflexible character hyun jin is also good choice as a laid back but stern character and im excited about this drama especially after the great movie however after seeing the early eps 2 is enough for me i 'm dropping this one idk maybe im too overexpect things but i feel this drama wasted a good source material and only pick up the changing appearance factor only i dont see chemistry among minki and hyun jin even though usually in dramas the main pair always bickering and be together in the end no clear story forced plot too many meh jokes and cheap slapstick i just think the movie deserves better adaptation kimiko oct 18 2018 10:37 pm im actually onboarded on this drama for lee da hee she may not be the lead on this drama but she 's definitely killin it i swear she really suites this type of roles i also like that they made her character not so evil and very likable now just waiting for her and ahn jae hyeon 's ship to sail but their random encounters are already a sweet tease and im lovin every second of it kdg 03/09 oct 18 2018 9:16 pm the chemistry between the leads is sooo damn fine even when han se gye portrayed by kim min seok i still got the chemistry and honestly it 's kinda trigger my fujo side hahaha it 's just because seo hyun jin and lee min ki build the chemistry perfectly and the support actors that portrayed any kind of han se gye delivered the act so good too btw i never watch an on going drama before coz i hate to waittt and stuff but this one is worth wait and worth watch 지수빙수 oct 18 2018 6:19 pm i 'm in love with this drama omggg why so cute funny and make me aaaw every time seo do jae with han se gye togetherrrr ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ seo hyun jin is sooo pretty love her so much and lee da hee yassss so hot omgosh not forget to mention how handsome lee min ki is his taking shower scenes roza oct 18 2018 11:55 am it s really good drama actually i am korean drama crazy but this drama i didn t watch it because of actor i don t like him but when i watched short video it s quite nice so i watched it released episodes all day night so now i m waiting for new ep so excited to see again. yuki chan oct 18 2018 10:34 am only reason ti warch this drama is lee tae ri .so freakin cute die schwarzgelben oct 17 2018 10:56 pm lee da-hee in this series looks damn hot hyunki oct 17 2018 12:10 am seriously this drama driven me crazy i just love lee min ki and seo hyun jin chemistry and thought they already in love as person not as their character lola oct 15 2018 1:18 pm everything from lee min kee and seo hyun jin is amazing they are one of the best in k-drama i guess good or bad script they will no doubt pull it through and make it happen this drama had an interesting start and keeps on getting better every on going episode i really do n't agree to negative comments i love enjoy and will support till the very end lmk shj you 're the best silly oct 15 2018 12:17 pm i have n't watch the movie but reading all the negative comments from the people that already watched the movie i do n't think i 'm going to personally i think this is a great movie just do n't compare it to the movie for me who have n't watch the movie this is an excellent drama min oct 15 2018 11:19 am nooo flower i disagree it is is really a good drama it has a bit natural thing but obviously it has to be different from the movie it should be why to watch the same thing again and i came because of ahn jae hyun .. please do support them i have n't seen till the latest episodes but it is quite nice though they should show a good bonding of lead coactor and actress that 's what u want i guess good drama overall flower oct 12 2018 9:49 pm currently at ep4 and for me its kind of disappointment a bit movie of this drama wrap up very nice sad and amazing plus impress me i expect this drama will amaze me too but sadly.. up to episode 3 its getting bored and lots of times wasted over flashback memory playing hard to get and again lee min ki deal with contract 'love partner.. i watched this drama bc of lee min ki and ahn jae hyun .. the plot is totally different from the movie and i think .. i do n't really like this drama plot i do n't think i am going to watch next episode may be i wait till all episode done then i skip to final ep just to see how they wrap up we have different type of taste as a viewer do n't mind my comment i just point out my opinion for me its does n't impressed me much does n't worth my time eun ji oct 11 2018 1:33 pm yay this is to much jtbc ..ep 1 is captivating for me already ..i 'll wait every week to be aired .aja elle oct 10 2018 12:45 pm min-ki never fail to make me smile like
