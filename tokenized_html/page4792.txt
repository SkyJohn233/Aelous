https //archive.org/details/sts9-2004-06-25 mishawaka amphitheatre ft. collins co my favorite sets covers pretty much all the great tracks red rocks sets are all pretty good as well most are on youtube i was listening to the local independent radio station out of nashville and they had an hour long interview with the guy who runs the caverns he said that many of the artists that have played this year have already reached out to playing there again in 2020 and for multi day runs he said that with them booking more from the electronic jam scene has been great for the venue as well as their bottom line so expect more he said they also just bought a bunch of acres connected to the land the caverns sits on that they plan to open up to camping in the future just thought i d let all the sad tribe fans like myself who missed their shows this year that there s hope for the future 212.50 rave spell ticket not able to be separated ticket was purchased with dice app for bandcamp presale so i
