top 100 teams milb.com history the official site of minor league baseball see all 100 teams by bill weiss marshall wright baseball historians amidst the triple-a colossi occupying the upper echelons of minor league baseball s top 100 list one class d club managed to slip into the top group playing in a small town in maryland this team seemingly performed the impossible in a truly singular campaign the town of salisbury maryland located on the delmarva peninsula joined organized baseball as one of the founding members of the six-team class d eastern shore league in 1922 the other cities were cambridge crisfield and pocomoke city all in maryland laurel delaware and parksley virginia all were located on the eastern side of chesapeake bay in an area known as the eastern shore the league played a 70-game schedule and in today s minor league structure would be considered a short-season league in the first campaign salisbury finished last with a 27-41 record parksley 42-25 .627 won the pennant then lost to martinsburg the blue ridge league champion in the first five state championship series the winner received the ned hanlon baseball cup named for the hall-of-fame manager of the great old baltimore orioles teams in 1923 the league expanded to eight teams adding dover and milford delaware unfortunately all the teams did not finish the season milford 9-19 quit july 14 rather than forfeit all its games because the team had violated the class man rule pocomoke city disbanded august 21 the infamous class rule was to plague the eastern shore league throughout its pre-world ii existence and created serious problems in many leagues in the lower minors the eastern shore league rule provided that no team could have more than three class players a class player was defined as one who had participated in 25 games if a position player and 15 games if a pitcher in a league of higher than d classification any game played by a team with too many class players on the roster whether the extra player s had been in the game or not was to be forfeited in some other leagues the games were simply thrown out of the standings but in the eastern shore the offending team was charged with a loss and the opponent credited with a win individual statistics such as wins and losses for pitchers were not affected over the next five years salisbury finished second or third every season the 1923 team featured the league s home run champion chick tolson who hit 27 in only 57 games he went on to play five years 1926-30 with the chicago cubs during this period there were several famous players who wore eastern shore league uniforms in 1923 a young man called frank king caught for the dover senators he really was hall-of-famer mickey cochrane using a pseudonym to protect his college eligibility in 1924 a teen-ager named jimmie foxx played for the easton farmers managed by franklin home run baker the same year yet another hall-of-famer red ruffing pitched for dover the catcher for the 1925 salisbury indians was 42-year-old nig clarke who 23 years earlier had hit a record eight home runs in one game for top 100 team 51 corsicana texas in 1926-27 paul richards long-time major league manager and executive played for the crisfield crabbers the 1926 season could only be described as a mess all because of the class rule with two weeks remaining in the schedule easton managed by ex-new york giants star second baseman buck herzog was in first place with a 44-27 record three games ahead of dover crisfield 28-42 had just climbed out of the cellar by taking four straight from fourth-place salisbury then on august 16 league president harry rew ruled that easton had been carrying five class players instead of the limit of three and 34 of their wins were forfeited that made easton s record 10-61 depositing them in the basement on august 22 parksley was found guilty of the same infraction and lost 20 victories and crisfield lost one win on august 30 dover 52-25 was first 5-½ games ahead of crisfield four days later at the third league meeting in two weeks 23 games won by dover were forfeited as were 22 won by cambridge their rule violations involved the same player outfielder roy akins who played for both teams during the season and had not been registered as a class man by either club the season ended september 6 with crisfield the greatest beneficiary of the forfeitures winning the championship with a revised record of 63-21 seven games in front of salisbury the 1927 season was a successful one for the league with several players sold to major league clubs the next year however economic hard times hit the area and attendance dropped on july 11 1928 the directors voted four to two to disband ending the first incarnation of the eastern shore league in the fall of 1936 the eastern shore league was revived as an eight-team circuit with cambridge crisfield dover easton pocomoke city and salisbury members in the 1920s plus centreville and federalsburg maryland colonel j. thomas kibler one of the league s organizers and former baseball coach at washington college in chestertown md was elected president the league adopted a 100-game schedule opening may 19 and closing september 6 seven of the eight teams were major league farm clubs and dover was affiliated with baltimore salisbury owned by baltimore laundry operator joe cambria who had close ties to clark griffith had a working agreement with the washington senators jake flowers a 35-year-old native of cambridge md and a ten-year major league infielder was making his managerial debut with salisbury the indians got off to a flying start and on the morning of june 19 were in first place with a 21-5 record by nightfall they were last with 0-26 kibler had ordered all 21 victories forfeited because he ruled that salisbury had five players with previous pro experience on the roster one more than the league rules allowed the disputed player first baseman bob brady who was hitting .246-0-7 in 15 games had signed a contract with harrisburg in the class a new york-penn league in 1934 but had been carried on the suspended list before his ultimate release without playing a game and did not play pro ball until signing with salisbury however kibler ruled that brady was an experienced player. in his announcement kibler said he felt the club was innocent of any knowing attempt to break league rules but that each club is responsible for determining the status of its players. in his book the eastern shore baseball league william w. mowbray writes to convince the league that he was sticking to his guns as far as the class player limit was concerned he forfeited salisbury s 21 victories. no doubt mindful of what had happened in the 1920s kibler was simply living up to his promise to keep the league clean of any violations that could jeopardize the circuit…soon thereafter he absorbed the wrath of clark griffith who reportedly said to kibler you re doing nothing more than ruining the league. kibler s reply was short and to the point mr griffith if we can t play baseball according to the rules of the national association let s break up the league. no further comment was made and mr. griffith had nothing further to say but the situation was now news across all the baseball world. cambria however did have something more to say he told the sporting news before the season opened the salisbury club submitted a list of players to the league president as is his duty kibler okayed the list and that satisfied me that the men were all right under league rules kibler must examine the rosters of all clubs he had as much knowledge about brady as salisbury did the decision to throw out 21 games has floored the indians but they ll never quit…tom kibler has always impressed me as being level-headed but in this case he seems to have forgotten the words common sense are in the english language. salisbury protested both the ruling itself and the decision to forfeit all 21 wins since brady had played in only 12 of them but national association president judge william g. bramham upheld kibler that wasn t the end of the legal maneuvering however the sporting news reported august 1 that brady will appear before commissioner kenesaw m. landis this week in an attempt to secure reinstatement on the salisbury roster on landis decision will depend whether salisbury will recover the 21 games the club was forced to forfeit…brady and salisbury officials contend he was illegally signed by harrisburg and never reported to the nyp club brady charges he was only 18 years old when he signed the harrisburg contract in 1934 and that it could not hold because his parents had not signed it the contract brady also charges was covered up by harrisburg in that it was marked suspended after he had been verbally released. landis held that he was without jurisdiction in the case cambria then announced that he would present brady s case to the national association s executive committee however nothing ever came of that either one interesting twist to the affair was the relationship between kibler and flowers jake had been one of kibler s players at washington college just after world war i and the pair had played shortstop and second base for the same semi-pro team at milford de mowbray reports that flowers said later of the incident i was a little upset at first when the coach deprived my club of 21 games sure i objected and protested most vigorously but i knew the old-timer meant just what he said. on june 20 flowers declared from now on we ask no quarter and offer none we ll be back in the first division before labor day. the indians did far better than that winning 49 and losing only 10 outscoring the opposition 425-163 they were back in first place by august 27 and went on to win the pennant and the playoff salisbury kept rising gradually reaching fourth place on august 15 and was in second place a week later on august 21 indians hurler leon revolinsky pitched a 1-0 no-hitter against dover the indians reached the top on august 27 when they trounced dover 14-7 as easton the team they replaced was losing to federalsburg 3-2 salisbury won its last ten games and finished with a 59-37 record 3-½ games ahead of easton from august 1 until the end of the season salisbury won 31 and lost only 3 on the field the indians actually won 80 games and lost 16 for an .833 percentage when credited for the games that were forfeited on september 1 more than 3,000 salisbury fans turned out to honor the wonder team as the sporting news called the indians washington owner clark griffith was the guest of honor engraved 17-jewel wristwatches were presented to all the players flowers and the three front office officials in addition flowers received an automobile even the bus driver the scoreboard operator and the batboy received gifts the indians responded by trouncing pocomoke city 10-2 the indians rode the strong right arms of joe kohlman and george comellas to the championship it is doubtful if two pitchers ever had better regular season records kohlman won 25 and lost 1 comellas won 22 and lost 1 kohlman lost his first start of the year then won 25 in a row comellas won 20 straight before losing 2-1 to centreville august 20 kohlman struck out a league-best 257 batters in 227 innings while

the nyp league and beat their big brothers 7-2 flowers made his first pitching appearance in 16 years and held trenton to one run and four hits in five innings the game was staged by the salisbury lions club with one-third of the receipts going toward the purchase of an ambulance for the local fire department in the fifth inning the game was halted briefly when kohlman was presented with the

batter laid down a bunt to the right of the mound comellas fielded the ball cleanly turned and threw to third base third baseman stan gray who had started to come in when the ball was bunted was

his head it caromed down the third base line eluding the left fielder who was charging in before the outfielder could retrieve the ball it had rolled all the way to the wall and all three seals had scored gray was charged with an error the only angels miscue of the game there was no more scoring the angels loaded the bases in the ninth with one out but gray struck out and pinch-hitter johnny

missing wins into their record the indians winning percentage of .833 stands supreme never equaled by any 20th century full-season minor league team terms of use privacy policy updated 09.02.2015
