Byzantine Cappadocia For past events, see Events Head of project: Dr. Anne Karahan anne.karahan@gmail.com The image of God in Byzantine Cappadocia: an investigation of its relation to divine and human in fourth-century Cappadocian thinking. The project is an interdisciplinary exploration of how Byzantine mural paintings in a number of churches at Göreme, Cappadocia, from the iconoclastic 8th-/9th-centuries to the 13th-century Latin Empire, depicted both that “God is” (not what God is) and that “God acts”. By means of a unique and new method Byzantine aesthetics will be mapped out on basis of dogmatic models of explanation of God´s transcendence (divinity, immateriality, invisibility), and God´s immanence (humanity, materiality, visibility) in texts by the 4th-century Cappadocian Fathers. The project is supported by Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (The Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation).                 P.k. 125 Beyoglu, TR-344 33 Istanbul, Tel. +90 212 252 41 19, Fax: +90 212 249 79 67, E-mail:  info@sri.org.tr               Skeppargatan 8, SE-114 52  Stockholm, Tel. +46 8 662 75 70.
