before moisturizing using a cotton pad packaging it comes in a lightweight clear plastic bottle with a flip-top cap the cap shuts tightly and prevents the product from leaking while travelling the cap has a small opening through which the product can be poured out i really wish this came in a spray bottle since then it would be easier to control the amount of product dispensed since the bottle is transparent it is easy to determine how much product is left a smaller 60ml bottle is also available but it can not be purchased separately and is part of a skincare kit that contains a face wash toner day cream and night lotion fragrance this is what i love the most about this toner while most toners smells either too herbal or too alcoholic this one smells divine heart itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s has an aquatic fragrance and is sooo refreshing color consistency it is a colorless liquid and has both the color and consistency of plain water it looks so pure and i love that there is no added color it feels soothing to just look at it ðŸ˜› iÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been hunting high and low for a toner that does not contain alcohol yet manages to remove residual dirt and tone my oily skin without drying it out it seemed like a lot of high expectations but this toner caters to all my demands yippee it removes grease grime and any residual cleanser very effectively in fact when i feel i donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to over-wash my face i just pour some of this toner onto a cotton pad and swipe away until my skin is clean it does not leave skin feeling tight or stretched in fact skin feels moisturized and supple those with very oily skin may find that their skin feels mildly sticky post application but nothing too bothersome since i have oily skin i can easily skip moisturizer when i use this and directly apply my bb cream or foundation it does not ever sting or burn even when used on irritated skin or around the eyes i was totally in love with this and had already decided that this was my hg toner untilÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ something strange happened the weather here is insanley hot and it must be the reason why my crystal-clear toner turned cloudy white pain i was in shock and looked up online but no one seemed to have faced a similar issue ðŸ˜¥ my husband suggested that i dump the entire contents and i hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t used up even quarter of the bottle struggle and bid adieu to my love but i was like noooo stop iÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d already checked the manufacturing and expiry dates and knew the product was otherwise fresh not wanting to give it up that easily i warily began to use it to see if it would react with my acne-prone skin nerd sometimes products infused with natural ingredients do tend to change color without having an impact on the potency of the ingredients thankfully the change in color had in no way affected the efficacy of the product phew sweat aaaaand once i got back home where the weather is much cooler the toner turned clear again yippee it turned cloudy white again when i went to a hotter place and turned clear again when kept in the frigde -/ yes the color kept yo-yo-ing back and forth but it worked equally well at all times so allÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s well that ends well cute the image on the right show the crystal-clear toner while the image on the left depict the color-change due to rise in temperature rating 4.8/5 final thoughts this is a super-nice moisturizing toner that is best suited for combination to oily skin those with dry skin can use this in summer since it is not at all drying and wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave skin feeling stretched those with oily skin will love it in winters and in summers will need to follow up with a mattifying moisturizer or powder to combat the mild stickiness this leaves behind in humid weather it smells divine and lifts grease and grime with ease despite the fact that mine very strangely turned cloudy and then changed back i still love this toner and wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind repurchasing cute you might also like reading these i have used and
