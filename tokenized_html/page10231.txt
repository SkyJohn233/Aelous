generating pi to nth digit java stack overflow by using our site you acknowledge that you have read and understand our cookie policy privacy policy and our terms of service i wanted to know how i can generate pi to the nth digit i have a couple of basic ideas so in short either way i would need to increase the precision of bigdecimal depending on what the nth digit is how would i go about increasing the precision of bigdecimal to nth digit also if there is a better and faster of doing this can you please point me in the correct direction edit i just want to generate pi i do n't want to use for calculations and this is a question about how i can use bigdecimal to implement my ideas of generating pi you need to use mathcontext to increase the precision of the bigdecimal e.g it 's important that all the bigdecimal s you use in your calculations use that mathcontext .heron 's method should give you 1000 digits precision with only 10 iterations and a million digits with 20 iterations so it 's certainly good enough.also create all the constant bigdecimal s like e.g 26390 only once at the start of your program you can use this code resource click here to upload your image max 2 mib cancel and add another image you can also provide a link from the web log in by clicking post your answer you agree to our terms of service privacy policy and cookie policy 2019 stack exchange inc
