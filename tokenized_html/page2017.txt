remix artura dublin delight oc remix facebook twitter tumblr email addthis posted 2005-08-28 evaluated by djpretzel lord liftin jaysus we 's outta rum but do n't you be worryin none me darling man i knowed we was going ta be short so i brought anudder bottle wid me for i find 's meself turrible wid me stomach dese days actually had a bit too much merlot tonight cue giamatti 's classic i am not drinking any f* ^ing merlot line from sideways so the timing is perfect to post this glass-raising pub-blazing irish drinking mix from yonder kinsman makke top o the morning to him sure guiness or jameson 's or a coffee of the spiked isles variety might have been more appropriate but the point is this mix goes where no mix has gone before tantalizingly exploring the tender nether regions of the concept of irish pub game arrangements like never before this is uncharted territory folks the undiscovered country i 'm actually half welsh so i can lay vague impartial claim to the type of inebriated celtic roots that yield such lovelies as this wee gem from marcus who also can now at least claim honorary irish heritage as well if in actuality he hath none remember the scenes in the lord of the rings trilogy where peregrine tookthingy and whatshisname got up on the table and sang something about a green dragon something like that with a narrative closer in spirit to the devil went down to georgia perhaps and you 'll begin to get the picture instrumentation is perfect vocals authentic puts pitt 's accent attempts to shame and there 's even a yaaa-naaaann-nanannanana section perfect for those so far lost to their drink that they ca n't be bothered to form actual words much less remember lyrics this is actually some rather awesome stuff extraordinarily creative and original and if it 's mixed a little hectic it 's all the better for it giving the feeling of a closed in rambunctious pub bustling with lively townsfolk and copious amounts of ale i 've never played artura and i probably never will but i love this mix generally like ben daglish 's work and absolutely dig what makke 's done with it this melody was calling out it wanted to be found hey-diddled with until it ended up a grand buddy/brewsky refrain on a parallel with jimmy buffet 's immortal why do n't we get drunk and screw and usable in an even wider variety of family-friendly contexts no less makke should be proud that he did the finding and also that he 's built up a library of extremely quirky but musically competent and intelligent mixes in a variety of styles of which this is no exception excellent stuff no matter how remotely far you are from having any irish in you whatsoever you ca n't be hatin on the dublin delight dye the river green and don yer clovers this one 's bustin out lucky charms-style â€• djpretzel i 've listened to this one quite a bit thank you~ c great piece that would fit well in a celtic band this is one of my favorite mixes and will be requested by me if it 's available it makes me smile i love this just amazing among the most memorable mixes that have graced the site i have n't heard this in many years and there was n't a single day of those years that i would n't have been able to recall this tune thanks to the infectious upbeat catchiness of its melody and production and as good as the music is i think the writing is just as stellar everything about this mix seems customised to the utmost of its celtic potential and it just oozes personality and fun because of it i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that everyone has fun listening to this and that very few people will immediately forget it fierce contender for my favourite vocal mix on the entire site despite its length and novel approach it makes it work and makes it work scarily well damn this song is good it 's so good it should become an internationally recognized pub song so i have attempted to help give this song the recognition it deserves by creating a high quality music video for it enjoy really a fun mix and not one that i 'd really expect to hear on ocr so that is a definite plus good production a fun lyrical tale and it gets the job done that it sets out to do short and sweet this is definitely more of a mood-setter but the quality is definitely there awesome but it 's a little bit short but it 's a great song every acoustic instrument holds its own and contributes to the festive mood at just the right times like the galloping clops during the chorus and the claps during the ya da da slurfest the story fits right in it sounds like something travelers can relate to i eagerly await what happens next and it even has a twist in the end sweeps me right off my feet *jigs* too short *hits replay holy balls how is it i 've completely overlooked this mix entirely until now celtic bias kicking in this mix is hot very nice work found it heard it loved it i 'm learning that the obscure mixes are the best ones on to the next one this is a gem not only is it a great arrangment with great lyrics and singing it 's also a clean production and convincing instruments honestly it 's hard to find a better song than this to make you happy one of ocr 's finest ahahahaahahahahahahhahahah this is just amazing i usually do n't listen to remixes unless i am familiar with the source the problem with that though is that i miss out on glorious little gems like this one makke is awesome if i had n't been told this was a video game theme remixed i would n't have known what a truly wonderful gem this is i had n't listened to this remix because i tend to only listen to games i have played and this incredibly well-put arrangement has changed my opinion on that this is just all-around goodness folks i feel like i 'm in another country in another era this is what music is all about thanks for this remix edit the lyrics are genius http //www.ocremix.org/remix/ocr01395/ under the lyrics tab the night was cold and bitter he was looking for an inn when the devil shined before him showing off an awful grin the demon spake you 're frozen and he nodded to the beast a fee so small the dark one said can make your life a feast chorus come within these walls of mine before the frost thee bite grab yourself a bottle of wine and drink it with delight come within these walls of mine before the frost thee bite at me table you will dine get yourself another pint well the young man said do n't bother soon i 'll find an inn because your home and castle is built on wicked sin the devil looked offended as the offer was denied but still he opened up the door inviting him inside chorus the demon kept on preaching i can make you whole and all i ask of you good sir is your immortal soul the dark one asked are you not tempted he said not the least for little did the devil know the man talking was a priest chorus help us save bandwidth using our torrents saves us bandwidth and lets you download multiple mixes as a single download use
