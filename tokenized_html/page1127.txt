a proof that a countable product of countable sets is non-empty that does not use the axiom of choice is the proof correct mathematics stack exchange by using our site you acknowledge that you have read and understand our cookie policy privacy policy and our terms of service let i i be some non-empty set of indexes and for every i ∈ i i \in i let a i a_i be a set with cardinality ℵ 0 \aleph_0 .is the following proof that the cartesian product ∏ i ∈ i a i \prod_ i \in i a_i is non-empty valid without the axiom of choice by definition since a i ℵ 0 |a_i| \aleph_0 for every i ∈ i i \in i then there are bijections f i n → a i f_i \mathbb n \rightarrow a_i for every i ∈ i i \in i let s define explicitly the function of choice g i → ⋃ i ∈ i a i g i \rightarrow \bigcup_ i \in i a_i by g i f i 0 g i f_i 0 it s clearly a function of choice hence ∏ i ∈ i a i ≠ ∅ \prod_ i \in i a_i \ne \emptyset qed if it is valid can it be generalized to any cartesian product of sets with equal cardinality if it is not valid why your argument does invoke choice albeit in a subtle way when you choose a family of bijections f i i ∈ i f_i i\in i\ just because for each i i the set f i f_i of bijections from a i a_i to n \mathbb n is nonempty doesn t mean that you can pick one for each i i this is exactly the axiom of choice applied to the family f i i ∈ i f_i i\in i\ in order to define g i g i you need to refer to a specific f i f_i so this use of choice is not easy to remove from your argument and in fact it can be proved that the statement you are seeking to prove is not provable in zf set theory without choice alone in fact this holds in the most powerful way possible even choice for families of two-element sets is not provable in zf there is absolutely no general way to pick a canonical bijection f i f_i sure it s possible when all your sets are in fact sets of natural numbers or something but in general why would you prefer f 0 f_0 over a different bijection which maybe maps f i 0 f_i 0 to f i 1 f_i 1 and vice versa this is where you used the axiom of choice you said that for all i i the set of bijections is non-empty and therefore you can choose one from each of these sets and that s how you got an element of the product of course it is consistent without the axiom of choice that a countable product of sets of size 2 2 can be empty when you think you 're defining g 'explicitly well in fact you are not you can do such 'explicit definitions e.g when you give an explicit formula on real numbers because you 're manipulating only one or a few symbols usually just x here you re manipulating an arbitrary number of symbols f i f_i just because you think of them as indexed by i does not mean you really can refer to them all until you have an axiom which says that you can do so that s ac it allows you to use an arbitrary number of symbols in that specific situation in fact it s more of a workaround than really using arbitrary number of symbols remember that g is an object of set theory which must be constructed using axioms there 's no such axiom as 'explicitly define a function click here to upload your image max 2 mib cancel and add another image you can also provide a link from the web log in by clicking post your answer you agree to our terms of service privacy policy and cookie policy 2019 stack exchange inc
