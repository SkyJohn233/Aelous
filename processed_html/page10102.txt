Talk:Eeveelution - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia Who coined the term?  Pok é ball  23:59, 21 November 2007 (UTC) It is a fanon term but we use it because it was a name of a TCG deck.  Pokemaniac102 Hey I made a new Eeveelutions page. I think you'll find it to be very informative! click  here .  T h e E s p e o n M a s t e r .  07:33, 26 November 2007 (UTC) Shouldn't someone mention that Leafeon and Glaceon have appeared in the anime, just not in person and that Glaceon  will  appear in  DP076 ? Pkmn luvr 25  03:49, 19 April 2008 (UTC) Im sure the term eeveelution isnt fanon because i just seen the new Majestic Dawn advert. Its the UK one with a 3d eevee stood in the middle of some ruins looking at cards of all of it's evolutions. The advert said "Collect a new  Eeveelution ! It's not fanon, its official. Should I change it? Davidaipom  15:18, 18 June 2008 (UTC) Anyone know were one of those might be found? Serebii has one but its not especially good quality. The scene would fit with the article.  Aura-Knight  23:20, 20 December 2008 (UTC) i was reading the Nintendo Power Stadium 2 Guild and in the back it said Eeveelution.-- Pokéboy93  05:19, 23 July 2009 (UTC) Though unlike their evolutionary cousins, they were not available early on in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, they are in fact available early on in Pokémon Platinum, even before the player has gotten the third badge. That's halfway correct. You can get Leafeon before the third badge, but not Glaceon. Should it be changed, or left the way it is?-- Gou  20:10, 10 October 2009 (UTC) this make a good FAC?  Cu bo ne King  03:16, 17 November 2009 (UTC) Considering that there are now seasons (as of Generation V), does that mean that we can expect to be able to get the eeveelutions in Black and White? -- Pokemon26  20:02, 23 October 2010 (UTC) Thank you for apologizing,Dennou Zenshi. I was just asking about the eeveelutions just because I wanted to know if that was possible. I knew that all the Pokemon for Generation 5 were released a month ago.-- Pokemon26  00:44, 24 October 2010 (UTC) I've just changed Espeon from dragon type to phycic type (probably vandels) no need to thank me :D -- Matty19892009  18:33, 21 November 2010 (UTC) anyone consider adding eevee's moveset to the template? why is it missing anyway other than the fact that it stop learning new moves at level 57? - Pokeant  05:53, 21 February 2011 (UTC) It has BITE as a stab move for eevee.  Grass is the best  ( talk ) 01:59, 12 November 2012 (UTC) While having each one's individual chart is nice, what about a collective chart comparing them like the legendary trio pages have?  Drake Clawfang  ( talk ) 03:57, 27 January 2013 (UTC) We can add a Generation VI subsection and state that Ninfia will be available in it. Also, for the anime section we can add a bit about how all of them will be featured in the upcoming short before the next movie. And the number of Eeveelutions at the top of the page needs to be changed from seven to eight.-- CoolDudeAl  ( talk ) 23:43, 12 February 2013 (UTC) No, this is not possible ever since GS. In-game party is only six. In those generation you could use Eevee in one slot and all five of its then evolutions in the remaining five slots. Not possible post-Generation III because Eevee has more than 5 evolutions. -- Hoenn Master  19:05, 13 February 2013 (UTC) There's a minor typo needs fixing on the last bullet point in the trivia section: "unless it it traded to Black and White," should say "unless it  is  traded". I'd have done it myself, but the page is currently locked due to Sylveon's announcement.  Digifiend  ( talk ) 14:51, 14 February 2013 (UTC) I made a new version to include Sylveon. Well, others did that too, but they just pasted its artwork onto the old image, which doesn't look very nice. Can I change it?  ★~Darklight~★   16:25, 14 February 2013 (UTC) How about a circular arrangement? Here  [1]  is the picture I made.  ★~Darklight~★   19:25, 15 February 2013 (UTC) Except it shows up as a badly stretched version of the old image for me. You can't keep that image when Sylveon's type is revealed anyway.  ★~Darklight~★  23:23, 15 February 2013 (UTC) I think that I can't edit the page, so I was wondering if someone that can would change the picture at the top that shows all the Eeveelutions to this [2] ? Mohacastle Hear My Roar  21:34, 14 February 2013 (UTC) How correct is this?  Can you trade Pokemon between BW2 and BW1 before beating the Pokémon League in BW2?  (Or should it say: trading to a BW2 player who  has  beaten the Pokémon League?)  -- Stratelier  07:46, 15 February 2013 (UTC) Ummm, yes it is? I've traded multiple times between my Black and Black2  before  beating the Legue.  ★~Darklight~★   19:25, 15 February 2013 (UTC) Since Sylveon's official art has been revealed, can someone change the image of Sylveon in the CoroCoro scan with her official art?-- PKMNAdventurer  ( talk ) 00:48, 16 February 2013 (UTC) The article doesn't look right the way it is right now, it has a sub-subsection for each Pokémon until Gen VI, it may not have much information for the subsection, or another (known) evolution in the generation for the Gen VI subsection, but it doesn't fit with the rest of the article... - EVs and IVsaurs  20:41, 21 February 2013 (UTC) Can we just make it the same as all the others but with "???" as the stats? (I have no idea how to do the username thing)-Poko907 Sorry for the derp-up a few minutes ago. I hope I've rerolled the changes correctly. I seem to be unable to add an extra column with Sylveon's stats to the Base Stat Comparison table. Is it due to how the template is coded?  Malenfant  ( talk ) 12:32, 26 October 2013 (UTC) Made a template , two options available, one is a template located at  User:Drake Clawfang/Sandbox2  that could be moved to the mainspace (the original sandbox has the template ready to transplant here too), the other was adapted from the movelist table here since the current style of stat table doesn't seem to have an image for Sylveon, so I'm not sure what would be wanted.  Drake Clawfang  ( talk ) 04:39, 6 November 2013 (UTC) Why does Umbreon's section state that as of generation 2 it is the only eeveelution uniquely suited to defending more than attacking when the VERY BEST vaporeon builds for that generation are all tank builds? I think that this is someones opinion and should not be stated as fact on a bulbapedia page.  Nokota  ( talk ) 19:15, 6 March 2014 (UTC) Because we don't know Sylveon's catch rate, can we hide this piece of trivia about catch rates for now until Sylveon's catch rate is from the official Pokémon website. -- Cinday123 ( Talk )  08:26, 15 March 2014 (UTC) Is it worth pointing out that despite  Eevee  and  two other  Eeveelutions being able to learn  Bite  by level up,  the Dark-type Eeveelution  cannot? -- PKMNAdventurer  ( talk ) 22:04, 2 June 2014 (UTC) I was watching this YouTube channel called TheNationalDex and they did a special episode on Sylveon and said that the designer (confirmed by Ken Sugimori himself to be Atsuko Nishida) also designed the other members of the Eevee family. Now... they are known for doing their research. They don't just spout B.S. ... But I can't find any mention of this anywhere. All sources I can find say Ken Sugimori designed ALL the Pokémon in existence. Which we all know for a fact is NOT true (Atsuko has also been confirmed as the sole designer of PIKACHU, and it's been stated that others also designed Kanto Pokémon as well. And we all know that other designers have gotten their 'mons into the game like the Vanilla line and such) So can anyone confirm or deny all nine Eeveelutions being Atsuko's babies? If this is true, she probably already has designs for the other nine remaining types waiting to be submitted, not to mention a Normal-type Eeveelution or Mega. :P -- BlackButterfree  ( talk ) 05:08, 6 July 2014 (UTC) In Gen I all the then current Eeveelutions shared a base special attack stat of 110. Is it worth noting this in the trivia where it talks about the similar stats? -- Terry152  ( Talk ) 08:16, 14 August 2014 (UTC) Is there a know "priority" for the Eeveelutions that could conceivably have their evolutionary conditions met at the same time as others? Specifically, If one were to level up an Eevee near a Mossy or Icy Rock, while it has the necessary friendship to evolve into Espeon/Umbreon, AND knows a Fairy-type move with at least two hearts of affection, which would it evolve into? What would it evolve into if two of these conditions were met? Is it random? Would the game just explode or something?  Masternachos  ( talk ) 22:09, 8 February 2016 (UTC) Should there be a separate page for the Eevee Users in Sun and Moon?(The Eevee Users are the people you must battle to acquire the Eevium Z.)  -  unsigned comment from  Reshiespeon  ( talk  •  contribs )  I feel it should be noted in the Trivia Section that every Eeveelution is a type that was considered  Special  (not Physical) before the  Physical/Special Split  of Gen 4 (With the exception of Sylveon, since Fairy didn't exist before that split), and possibly that the only Special type that isn't represented in the Eeveelutions is Dragon. Should this be added?  YumiScott  ( talk ) 01:13, 12 April 2017 (UTC)
