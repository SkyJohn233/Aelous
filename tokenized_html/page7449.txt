and asked for a posting in italian east africa whose new viceroy was the respected amedeo duke of aosta who was a mentor of guillet in italian east africa he carried out various policing operations against insurgents loyal to the toppled emperor haile selassie world war ii in the build up to world war ii aosta gave guillet command of the 2,500 strong gruppo bande amhara made up of recruits from throughout italian east africa with six european officers and eritrean ncos the core was cavalry but the force also included camel corps and mainly yemeni infantry for guillet to be given command of such a force while still only a lieutenant was a singular honour in 1940 he was tasked to form a gruppo bande a cavallo the bande a cavallo were native units that were recruited from italian officers who commanded these units amedeo guillet succeeded in recruiting thousands of eritreans his band already named in the history books as gruppo bande guillet or gruppo bande a cavallo were distinguished for their absolute fair play with the local populations amedeo guillet could boast at never being betrayed and 5000 eritreans knew perfectly well who he was and where he lived it was during this time in the horn of africa that the legend of a group of eritreans with excellent fighting qualities commanded by a notorious devil commander was born guillet s most important battle happened towards the end of january 1941 at cherù when he decided to attack enemy armoured units at the end of 1940 the allied forces faced guillet on the road to amba alagi and specifically in the proximity of cherù he was entrusted by duca amedeo of aosta with the task of delaying the allied advance from the north-west the battles and skirmishes in which this young lieutenant was a protagonist amedeo did not have the appropriates rank but he commanded an entire brigade are boldly written in the british bulletins of war the devilries that he created from day to day almost seen as a game explains why the british called him not only knight from other times but also the italian lawrence of arabia horse charges with unsheathed sword guns incendiary and hand bombs against the armoured troops had a daily cadence a look at official documents show that in january 1941 at cherù … with the task of protecting the withdrawal of the battalions… with skillful maneuver and intuition of a commander… in an entire day of furious combats on foot and horseback he charged many times while leading his units assaulting the preponderant adversary in number and means soldiers of an enemy regiment setting tanks on fire reaching the flank of the enemy s artilleries… although huge losses of men … capt guillet … in a particularly difficult moment of this hard fight guided with disregard of danger an attack against enemy tanks with hand bombs and benzine bottles setting two on fire while a third managed to escape while in flames. in those months many proud italians died including many brave eritreans who fought without fear for a king and a people who they never saw or knew even today the devil commander uses words of deep respect and admiration for that proud population to whom he feels himself in debt as a soldier italian and man he never stops to repeat that the eritreans are the prussians of africa without the defects of the prussians his actions had the hoped success and saved the lives of thousands of italians and eritreans who withdrew in the territory better known as the amba alagi at dawn gulliet charged against steel weapons with only swords guns and hand bombs at a column of tanks he passed unhurt through the british forces who were caught unaware amedeo then returned to the steps in order to recharge in the meantime the british succeeded to organize themselves and fire at raised zero with their howitzers the shells ripped open the chests of guillet s horses before exploding it was the last cavalry charge that british forces faced as well as one of the last in the history of warfare guillet then turned to charge again in the meantime however the british had organized themselves and fired horizontally with their howitzers another cavalary charge took place little more than a year later when a friend of guillet colonel bettoni launched the men of the savoia cavalry against soviet troops in russia at isbuchenskij citation needed guillet s eritrean troops paid a high price in terms of human losses approximately 800 died in little more than two years and in march 1941 his forces found themselves stranded outside the italian lines guillet faithful until death to the oath
