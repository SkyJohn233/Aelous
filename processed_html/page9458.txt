September 5, 2011 Verified owner You know what I am talking about. You log in one morning to find that game has just gone up for sale. One of those obscure games that stole many hours from childhood. You try telling other people about it and they just stare at you blankly. Its game that you swore that if you ever saw it again, you would buy it post-haste. Nox is that game for me. I love this game. Its a game I  never finished. I let someone borrow it, and it was lost forever. It was one of my most tragic video game experiences... But hey look. Good news. Here it is. On GOG. For under 10 bucks. Hell.Yes. To say that Nox is just a Diablo clone (as many Critics accused it to be at the time of its release) is to greatly underestimate this game. Yes it has many similarities, and many people who have played the  Read more termit         Games:                     Reviews:        2     A fine hack & amp;slash September 5, 2011 Verified owner A hidden gem from the time when Diablo 2 came out, this game was unjustly overlooked in favor of its AAA cousin. While, at its core, it is a typical hack & amp;slash RPG, there are enough ideas of its own to put it above the crowd.First, and the most important - there are no procedurally generated levels. While this does limit replayability, it allows for more focused and clear single player campaign. The game is not a one-shot thing, though. Each of the three classes has a distinct story, with different places to visit at start and endgame, so it ' s worth to do a play-through for each class.Speaking of the classes, they are well defined and play very differently from each other. The warrior is an in-your-face melee fighter, while the mage (as expected) is staying outside the fray, using  Read more ChernobylCow         Games:                     Reviews:        1     A Dungeon Crawl at Full Sprint September 6, 2011 Verified owner Playing Nox is like dashing through an obstacle course coated in the best of high fantasy trappings. You ' ll test your mettle against devious traps, exploding fireballs, hordes of wizards and skeletons galore in this isometric action game. Its strongest feature is the solid mouse and hotkey gameplay that still holds up 10 years after Nox ' s retail release. While Nox may be light on story and tease you with its RPG-like appearance, a fast-paced momentum and filled with fun gameplay will propel you to the end of the game ' s three unique campaigns.For the longest time Nox has been mislabeled as a Diablo clone. However, it ' s core design is completely different than Blizzard ' s hack and slash title. The Diablo series '  mainstay has always been: character progression, randomized dungeons and the  Read more alonewestand         Games:                     Reviews:        1     Listen to me well and good.  Buy this. October 4, 2011 Verified owner Released under the shadow of Diablo 2, this game went largely unnoticed.  That ' s a sad thing, because this is one of the best games I ' ve ever played.Now before you scoff and say,  " surely, sir, your nostalgia goggles cloud your judgment.  Good day! "   Wait.  I played this game for probably 6 or 7 years, I ' m not quite sure, until the official servers went offline.Now before you scoff and say,  " surely, sir, since the servers have gone down this game has severely dropped in value.  I must again bid you good day. "   Wait.  There are others like me, who know the greatness that is Nox.  Check out www.noxforum.netThe official servers are down, yes, but there are always dedicated fans to great games struggling to keep the community alive.

Ignore everyone who says it ' s a clone or a rip off, because the fact that genres are the same is all they have in common. The setting, characters, story, weapons, quests, etc. are very different. It ' s a campy game with great humor and excellent gameplay mechanics. The story is nothing to write home about, but it could be good if you ' re in the mood for it. Jack is the main hero, and you can customize the colour of his hair, skin and clothes (which is irrelevant when you start getting armor) but not his sex or appearance. There are three different classes to pick for him (Warrior, Conjurer, Wizard), each with their own separate starting areas. Multiplayer was fun but it ' s nonexistent now. Luckily the single player stands out on its own.
