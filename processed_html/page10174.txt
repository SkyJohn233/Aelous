Pink/Red Screen Upon Login : swtor Sometimes after logging in, SWTOR will just display a reddish/pinkish screen with the SWTOR mouse cursor. If I hit CTRL + U to refresh the UI, it will show the picture of one of my characters in their ship, but no other UI elements will be there. Nothing is clickable and I end up having to ALT + Tab out and close the program. Do any of you know of a fix or if this is a known issue? I &# x27;ve run into this a few times with a single monitor setup and fixed it by editing my client_settings.ini (located at  C:\Users\ < your_username > \AppData\Local\SWTOR\swtor\settings\client_settings.ini  on Win7/Vista,  C:\Documents and Settings\ < your_username > \Local Settings\Application Data\SWTOR\swtor\settings\client_settings.ini  on XP).  Remove the entire  [Renderer]  section and restart the game.  Note that you will have to redo your graphics settings. By remove the render secion what does that mean exactly? Like just the word renderer, all the stuff underneath it and not the word, or just all of it? Most forum posts will tell you it is an issue with your graphics card.  So reinstall your drivers as Physo recommends.  I had a similar issue and it ended up being an issue with my DirectX installation.  So you might look into repairing that as well. Happened to me, but only once on the PTS servers. Just restart the game and that worked for me :) Have not seen this issue again. Most likely a Graphics card issue. Whats your graphics card and are the drivers up to date I have a Sapphire 7970 and this problem occurred with my old GPU which was a Sapphire 6950. Drivers are up to date. 113k Members 997 Online Apr 28, 2009 Cake Day
