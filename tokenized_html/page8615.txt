archbishop ryan high school in the summer of 2013 archbishop ryan began an effort in rebranding ensuring our logo slogan and colors were used most effectively to represent the school our ar logo is immediately recognizable to our community and beyond as are our school colors our uniform however did not make strong use of our idea of branding as an administration we began meeting earlier in the school year with representatives from flynn and o hara to discuss this and ideas and proposals have been presented faculty and students have had the opportunity to provide feedback on some of the options presented the new uniform is the culmination of that feedback we believe the impression this new uniform makes is the best representation of our brand our logos and our colors our current freshmen and juniors will still be able to wear their uniform from this year provided it is in good condition and fits appropriately if a student wishes to wear the new uniform they are of course allowed what students can not do is mix and match the new with the old for example a senior could not wear the new cardigan with the grey skort or grey pants next year the summer uniform will require all students to be in a golf shirt for grades 9 and 11 it will be the red golf shirt for grades 10 and 12 they can wear their white golf shirt but do have the option of wearing the red one provided they switch to the black pants or black short in the winter all girls will be required to wear black tights but in the summertime they will have the option of tights or knee socks the length of the skort required to be no more than two inches above the knee will be strictly enforced and a student will not be allowed to attend school or classes if in violation
