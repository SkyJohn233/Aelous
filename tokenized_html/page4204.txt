another trip to the poconos in the near future and staying again at the bunkhouse just arriving home from a fabulous girl x27 s weekend and had to write a five-star review although we were initially surprised by the location the home itself is absolutely perfect and is decorated so nicely richard was extremely responsive and offered helpful hints on working the hot tub and even went above and beyond to recommend a winery in the area despite his own unfamiliarity all of my guests had a wonderful time thanks to the beautiful accommodations thank you again the house is pretty there is a lot of space but we didnt enjoy it as much because the host made multiple calls which made us feel like we were on surveillance so we did not enjoy as much as wed like when we rented the house it said hotub included but later we found out that it was an extra fee for it and we got charged 2 days for something we only used a couple hours the first day we stayed at the house but the second day we felt like we were forced to leave and arrive at night because of so many excess calls second time staying here and it was wonderful such a cozy home a beautiful home that was even better than the pictures the bunk room was a perfect place for the kids to play they were safe in there without me having to hover over the baby who crawls on everything the two bathrooms were newly tiled and i loved the farmhouse style we walked to the ice-cream store on the corner everyone loved the hot tub and the patio was a great place to relax entire home/apt house 12 4 tannersville pa united states my wife

beautiful mornings and cool evenings there x27 s a firepit which was great to sit around and roast marshmallows and enjpy the night everything was close by especially appreciated all the pamphlets our host provided to help us plan our days we will definitely be coming back definitely recommend marijke was incredibly accommodating and allowed for me to arrive an hour or so after midnight while driving cross country though i had arranged much earlier in the day with little time to look her place seemed like a very relaxing restful experience and it absolutely was just that this cabin has been incredibly updated and is obviously very well taken care of marijke provided plenty of instruction for me to locate the cabin at night and as a 30 year old female driving to a cabin in the poconos at night i still felt safe in the area i was even gifted a bit of extra rest time last minute which was so very helpful and something i don t often ask for nor do i ever mind if it isn t logistically possible and her cleaning lady even adjusted her schedule a bit for me incredible host wonderful airbnb excellent for all travelers individuals groups families and even same-day guests traveling solo with their service pup üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº entire home/apt cabin 6 3 stroudsburg pa united states the highlight of greg s place is the tremendous value it is almost like an entire

stroudsburg pa united states had a great stay perfect for a weekend getaway to the poconos great hiking close by great place better than advertised would highly recommend this place to others very quiet place clean great linens close to shopping wineries and hiking trails would definitely stay again great place very clean nice decorations this location is well worth the trip to see the area is absolutely beautiful secluded and definitely gives you more than what you pay for just in the views around you alone i definitely recommend his spot for anyone trying to escape the business of the area and just relax in your down time close to everything can x27 t ask for much more this is a great location for wineries and hiking the kitchen is no frills but decorated nicely and all the amenities for cooking beautiful wooded neighborhood with great sense of privacy this place is a good no-frills spot to lay your head we loved that it was dog friendly and we were able to take our dog to nearby delaware water gap and camelback area for hiking and outdoor eateries mountain view vineyard winery is fantastic we wished there was an outdoor space to hang out at the apartment but the outdoor space backyard belongs to the main house which of course we respected the house is on a very quiet cul-de-sac and you ll see deer wandering about but there is a shopping center practically around the corner so you re not totally in the middle of nowhere bottom line if you re looking to sit by a firepit and look at the stars at night this may not be the place for you if you re not the outdoorsy type it s perfect and it would be a great place to stay over the winter when you want to be close to camelback and/or the outlets entire home/apt apartment 3 1 stroudsburg pa united states beautiful view home is just as beautiful as the pictures had depicted 3 beds/no baths but no bathroom on the main level 2 bedrooms king bedroom and bunk beds are downstairs as well as main bathroom

enough space for 12 people 2 foam mattresses were provided in the big closet downstairs they x27 re very comfortable the unit itself is a corner unit and close to the gate/entrance and the office amenities were very nice i highly recommend this place the home was beautiful clean and spacious i recommend this space if ever in the area everything was as described beautiful home very clean spacious the only downside is that there is only one ac in the living room the second floor bedroom basement bedrooms only have fans which makes it very humid at night place was as seen in the photos

to a bunch of personal touches to help us celebrate our anniversary that we discussed when i was booking the beds were incredibly comfortable including the linens there was soooo much space our first night at the house we played pool late into the night which was super fun there were tons of games towels shampoo toothpaste coffee olive oil and spices pots and pans tons of utensils/plates/cutlery etc etc the list could go on and on felt like everywhere we turned we found more amenities and more rooms to hang out in and things to do there were great books and games for the kids and cute touches for adults and kids alike the basement was like it s own paradise i was lucky enough to get the master bedroom since i booked for my family for my anniversary and i thoroughly enjoyed the privacy of it but it almost doesn t matter because there were spaces spread out everywhere and nobody was on top of one another there were also great touches out in the yard like sidewalk chalk and the swing set we stayed for 3 nights and we didn t even do everything the house had to offer close drive to family activities as well like the crayola experience we d definitely consider booking again and we d be intrigued to book in the winter georgi is very communicative and that help d make our stay even easier this was a great place for a family vacation everything was neat and clean the decor tasteful and

very good if you are looking for a bite out all in all a great place to stay oh and the hiking nearby is also great the house is very comfortable and accommodates a family of 10 quite well there are plenty of bathrooms so that you do not get pinched in the morning when everyone is getting ready for daily adventures this property is just a few minutes from some hikes the outlet shopping and some
