reopening the x-files improbable tor.com season 9 episode 13 improbable original airdate april 14 2002 there is a lot of god in the x-files which is not really a surprise the x-files is often a show about explaining the unexplainable it is also often a show about not being able to explain the unexplainable and god is handy for that sort of thing unfortunately the show s biblical parallels tend to be more exhausting than enlightening—which is why improbable is such a pleasant dare i say improbable surprise because god is here and he is burt reynolds he is pleasant he is all-knowing he is wearing some very loud shirts and he is apparently unable to alter the events in front of him as god he shuffles cards plays checkers and buries his advice in cryptic backtalk why he s on earth at all right now is a mystery maybe this is what he does all the time or maybe this is a special occasion maybe he just likes the feast of san gennaro but while he s here he is trailing after a numerology-obsessed serial killer whose pattern has coincidentally-or-not just been clocked by agent reyes improbable is a highly stylized episode written and directed by the show s own god chris carter much like he did in post-modern prometheus carter creates himself a whimsical pocket universe in which the bad things that happen are counterbalanced by goofy camera angles musical numbers and split-screens unlike what he did in post-modern promethus the horrific-looking murders in improbable are actually treated as horrific not as something sweet that a monster did because he didn t know any better while it s not a straight-up laffer the episode has a giddy goofy energy to it—it s like a doctor who episode with reyes as the doctor scully as the companion* and doggett as uh…let s say mickey smith ** the plot such as it is reyes apparently knows her numerology and she s noticed a bright numerological pattern in a series of unsolved murders she floats the idea past scully who s ready with the dismissal until she notices a pattern of bruising on each of the victims reyes goes to see a numerologist played by the unsinkable ellen greene who honestly between her work in little shop of horrors pushing daisies and this episode should probably get a specific sort of award for amazing work in non-naturalistic environments reyes work in connecting these cases is applauded by the fbi literally applauded by a room full of agents right up until she reveals her method faces fall as she starts talking numerical vibrational disharmonies and fall further once they hear that ellen greene numerologist has been killed by the killer meanwhile burt reynolds he s showing up wherever the killer is showing up and the killer has noticed on a little italy-esque street surrounded by central casting italy burt reynolds deals a little three-card monte and advises the killer to choose better. but—choose what his victims the killer is working a pattern it turns out groups of three women a blonde a redhead a brunette but is burt reynolds the sort of god to encourage a killer to kill better not exactly you know your problem he says to the killer it s not the cards it s playing the hand you were dealt. what he means is break the pattern—but do it by not killing again the killer scowls and the killer stalks away and god sighs clyde bruckman as a deity allowed only to watch while leaving the scene of the numerologist s murder scully and reyes ride the elevator with the killer scully notices a ring on the man s hand identifies it as the ring that caused the bruising pattern on the victim and draws her weapon the killer escapes into the parking garage reyes and scully follow but lose him somehow and find themselves locked in the parking garage alone until they find god burt reynolds is in his car with a trunk full of cds i love all music but i prefer the stuff that lasts and a checkerboard it s for a regular game he says one he plays with a friend scully and reyes then play checkers with god because this episode allows that sort of thing he beats them easily and then they play each other while burt reynolds dances nearby after just a few moves reyes squints at the red on the board then squints at the red in scully s hair and ah-hah she s figured out the killer s hair-centric pattern now it seems like they ve got something except they re still in that garage and then it turns out that the killer is also in the garage and has been the whole time and then he s about to kill reyes but then mickey sm—sorry john doggett appears and shoots the killer dead and reyes asks the killer why he killed but he doesn t say and then he dies and then they look for god and god is disappeared so yes it s either a little too messy or a little too neat but it s genuinely fun burt reynolds is a charmer and the nonsense about games and fates and winning and choice is not really all that nonsensical particularly when compared to some of the soliloquies about fate and the universe that the show has dealt us over the past nine 9 seasons the episode ends with music central casting italy singing along to an italian tune and dancing in the bright lights of what turns out to be a twinkle in burt reynolds cosmic eye is the x-files a game and if so are we winning chris carter only knows *oh my god what if scully were a companion*** **more accurately gun-toting parallel-universe-guy ricky smith ***i mean obviously she should be the doctor but trust no one meghan deans is obviously someone you are very lucky to have run into she tumbls and is meghandrrns i had abandoned ship by this point but this sounds fun if scully were a companion i definitely would have kept watching season 9 even so now i want to dig out the dvd set and watch this episode actually gillian anderson did get to be a companion of sorts she performed on stage with christopher eccleston in the doll s house in london you re already doing a great job with the website and the blog i love the content here and i m always glad to come back and read some toughts on photography – be it gear shooting or something else loved the recent video for samsung i love that it isn t a gear review site i d suggest you keep doing what you are and adding some odd piece of gear you found interesting and think people don t know enough about or don t use it enough or in the right way if someone wants a review there are already sites that do them and are doing only that this site isn t that and it should never be.it s not like it s hard to find a review today for anything if agent doggett is mickey smith then that makes doggett … the tin dog i see what you did there meghan also burt reynolds takes over the x-files as effortlessly as he did when guest-starring on archer in a manner akin to bill shatner on 3rd rock from the sun clearly divinity suits them theologically there is a long-standing problem with a deity that is conceived as omniscient omnipotent and benevolent namely why evil often to avoid blaming the deity one of the attributes is removed or limited if we drop benevolence we get lovecraft if we limit omniscience we get oh god or bruce almighty with the frisson of too much power in unsure hands limiting omnipotence gives us the most approachable even perhaps pitiable deity one who can watch but not prevent evil plus loud shirts but who is the actual kller burt or the guy they shot was burt controlling him receive notification by email when a new comment is added you must be a registered user to subscribe to threads all comments must meet the
