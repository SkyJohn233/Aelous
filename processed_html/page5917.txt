Holidays, a song ( Brighton in the Rain ) and the good ol  present perfect! | Lizzie Pinard I first learnt about  Brighton in the Rain , by Robert Campbell and Jonathan Dykes, from my CELTA tutor at Sheffield University, many moons ago. When I first used this song, I struggled to find a recording   lots of googling led me to a discussion thread/feed where it had been mentioned and emailing the person who mentioned it finally scored me a copy. ( Thank you, whoever you are! I can t remember your name or where I found that obscure thread, but it was good to get my hands on the song at last! ) Of course, nowadays it s freely available on  youtube.com  and various other websites   like so much else. Anyway, faced with a grammar-heavy few pages of course book ( present perfect central! ), I dug it out   the first time in a while!   and used it with my pre-intermediate students to lighten it up for them a little. Topic-wise, it feeds nicely in to what comes next in the book, which is travelling-related ( and a heap more present perfect information! ). Here is what I did with it: 1hr 20 minutes a recording of the song (now available  here );  cut-up lyrics ; a  handout  of the complete song lyrics; this  powerpoint  (shared here minus the photos I used, as those were copyrighted   but all you need to do is a Google images search for pictures of Brighton in the rain  and a picture of Brighton on a map !); this handout (based on the powerpoint   for the learners to have a take-away record); this  empty rubric , which is based on the song. Review of the present perfect for life experiences, use with  ever / never / always / only , asking and answering questions using the form, using the form to discuss their own experiences; listening, speaking, writing. Listening Tell your partner about some of the places where you have been on holiday. Do you usually go somewhere different or do you go back to the same place every year? What are the pros and cons of going to the same place every year and going to a different place every year? Does the singer visit different places every year? (No!) Where has he been? (Only Brighton and the Isle of Mann!   but of course the learners will hear lots of places that he  hasn t  been to ) Brighton in the rain! (image taken from advanced Google images search, licensed for commercial reuse with modification, from commons.wikimedia.org) Language focus What tense do we use to talk about life experiences? How do we form it? (positive sentence, negative sentence, question, short answers) Do we know when the experience happened? Does it matter when the experience happened?  I ve  never  been to Athens and I ve never been to Rome.  I ve  only  seen the pyramids in picture books at home.  I ve  always  spent my holidays in Brighton, in the rain!  Have you  ever  been to Athens?  Have you  ever  been to Rome? Speaking and Writing *Variation If you run out of time (cough cough!) around the stage I marked with an asterisk, I recommend getting the learners to finish completing the rubric  as their partner  (so, as they have begun via interview but by guessing the information about their partners rather than doing it through questioning). At the beginning of next lesson, I plan to get them back in the same pairs again to see how near or far they were with their guesses! Possible homework/follow-up (If you use  Edmodo ) Get learners to write a few sentences about their experiences (encourage them to use experiences they have not yet discussed ) and send them directly to you (using that function on  Edmodo !) and then you post all of their experiences onto the class page. They should then read and guess which experiences go with which classmates! Thoughts: I think this lesson worked well, to give the learners a bit of extra time to get their mouths and minds around the present perfect. In the book, a lot of information comes at them in a short space of time – for, since, ever, never, contrasting with past simple and so on, so this broke it up a bit and gave them extra opportunities to hear it used and use it themselves – as well as being a bit of fun to break up a very grammar-heavy unit a bit!  5 ways of using Edmodo with language learners (part 1) In  " Classroom Talk " My top ten ELT books - how many have you read?

And the funny thing is I am doing a CELTA at Sheffield right now. Would definitely recommend it! CELTA at Sheffield uni is definitely a Good Thing. I have very fond memories of mine.   Enjoy the rest of yours!  Thanks! I am having a great time and learning lots. More than I learnt on a PGCE I think. I am doing it online and part-time, definitely a good way to do this as you have more time to reflect and read around the subject than on the 4 week version.

Thanks  I ve set myself the challenge of posting a lesson based on a song in the Top 10 every week so I hope to repay the favour soon.  This is great! Thanks a lot. As soon I watched the video and heard the words Pyramids, I thought I could also use to run a guessing game. I lived in Brighton and also in Egypt, but I’ve never visited the Pyramids.   I’ll definitely use your ideas. Thanks again. Glad you like it!
