It’s a great moment for us to be hosting the first ever standalone ICC Women’s World T20 event, which marks the coming of age of the women’s game, says Windies captain Stafanie Taylor. It’s going to be a great event, it’s going to be epic. We will have some amazing entertainers coming to the ground. It will be quite different to all the other events we have played in.

It will bring some more fans into the matches to watch the best players in the world. #WatchThis ! It's the official tournament song of ICC Women's  #WT20  2018! ? Not long until the party starts in the Caribbean! ?  pic.twitter.com/04Lu0Yvj7c We have some wonderful memories from this tournament. Winning in Kolkata was definitely the best memory… not just winning, but winning for the West Indies. That’s special. I’ve won other titles before, but winning that trophy for the people of the West Indies was amazing. What made it even more amazing was the fact that the Under-19 men won their World Cup a few months earlier and the men’s team won on the same day we did. For us, you could see the progression from going to semi-final to semi-final, climbing the mountain (2010, 2012, 2014). So winning in India was like reaching the mountaintop. This is a modal window.

Expectations are high from us playing at home and it is important that we keep our composure and not get too much ahead of ourselves. We have to concentrate on how we want to play as a team. We know that the Caribbean is zooming in because they want to see great things and we want to do great things for the Caribbean. It is important that we keep focused on what is required on the field and remain relaxed off the field. The game has evolved a lot since I started as a 16-year-old. The players are more classy and with more finesse. You see switch-hitting, reverse sweeps…it comprises so many new things. The players are definitely fitter and very athletic. The fielding standards have improved tremendously. It is amazing. We have fast bowlers like Katherine Brunt who is among the quickest and you also have players like Elyse Perry, who is an excellent bowler and all-rounder. In our side we have Shamilia Connell who is our fastest. She has matured and knows her game and it’s really good to see that someone who we have been grooming now understands her game fully and can get wickets for us. From when we started back in May with the special camps organized by Cricket West Indies here in Antigua, the management, the coach, the trainer have been pushing the players to improve fitness and skills and I have seen tremendous improvement. I have seen a whole different level of fitness and you could see it when we played against South Africa in the recent ODIs and T20Is. The century by Hayley Matthews in Barbados in the fifth ODI was stunning. It was beautiful to be at the other end batting with her and to witness that kind of performance. Anisa Mohammed took a hat-trick in the T20Is and she continues to lead from the front. She started way back, I believe at age 15. Now she is one of the senior players. When you look at players getting older, that’s more experience and you tap into that experience and maturity out there in the middle. That’s what she offers the team, a level head, a focused individual who can make the right decisions under pressure. This is a modal window. This is a modal window.

I have not played a lot there so we will go there and access and look to make a positive start. I know we will get great crowd support at the venue. The surface in St Lucia is a pretty good one, I’ve played there a lot of times and we enjoy the conditions at the Daren Sammy Cricket Ground. This is a modal window. This is a modal window.

You get great value for your shots and the atmosphere is great with breeze coming across the ground. We just want this to be a wonderful tournament in three great venues. We want the fans to come out and enjoy seeing the best players in the world showing their skills and putting on a show. It will be great!
