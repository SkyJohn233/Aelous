Aquatic Eden - Aquascaping Aquarium Blog Aquascaping news, guidance, and tips for aquascaping freshwater planted aquariums. good posting.i like it. thank u. :)- www.bathmateus.com Good to know about its low to medium light requirement and growth speed. I just tied one to the top of my drift wood close to the water surface. Will change its location. Thanks. good info though you should mention if any of the leaves somehow get to air their growth doubles as of any anubais I have anubias plants (not sure what species) and they do better in my aquariums that are kept more on the dark side than well lit. They seem to prefer low light in my years of aquarium hobby.
