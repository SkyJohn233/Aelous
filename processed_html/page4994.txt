Reddit, have you ever tried a hypnosis video on youtube? What were the effects? : AskReddit yes. I fell asleep I &# x27;ve watched one and came to the conclusion that they &# x27;re complete and utter bullshit.  There &# x27;s no way to get excited by relaxing, there &# x27;s no way to improve a brain by not using it and there &# x27;s no way a ten minute session is going to solve complex problems or make a lasting change in a long term habit. But I understand other people &# x27;s curiosity regarding those videos. If you want my opinion, if you want to better yourself and have better experiences, skip the hypnotherapy, get out from in front of the computer and go do something. I have. I actually used it to get over a boyfriend. It didn &# x27;t work but it did help me relax. Why is this NSFW? Because OP is hoping to get some jerk off material. because there are some nfsw hypno movies not on youtube, but guess what, it didn &# x27;t work ;) 25.6m Members 105k Online Jan 25, 2008 Cake Day
