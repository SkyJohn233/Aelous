Tribute Screening On November 18th, Sean Nelson wrote, "Sharon Jones, the singer whose astonishing talent helped usher in a revival of classic-styled soul music over the past decade, died today after a long, and well-publicized battle with pancreatic cancer." Celebrate and remember Jones's life and work at this tribute screening. Read Dave Segal's description of the film below:  Want another documentary about a musician overcoming great adversity to achieve glittering critical and modest commercial success? Possibly not, but you should make room in your callous heart for director Barbara Kopple's  Miss Sharon Jones!  The titular subject is a powerful vocalist who merits your respect and attention, regardless if you're a fan of her band the Dap-Kings' tried-and-true R , soul, and funk. Born in South Carolina to a mother acquainted with the godfather of soul, James Brown, Sharon Jones took a long time to get her music career going, not releasing her first record until she was 40. But she made up for lost time by cutting several high-quality, pitch-perfect releases and proving herself to be a galvanizing live performer, inspiring James Brown comparisons. Once you see her onstage, you realize this is not hyperbole.  DAVE SEGAL Northwest Film Forum 2.  Old Stone Until recently, the streets in China’s towns and cities were filled with pedestrians, bikes, and motorbikes. Now they are filled with pedestrians, bikes, motorbikes, cars, and trucks. In  Old Stone , directed by Chinese Canadian Johnny Ma, an ordinary taxi driver, Lao Shi (Chen Gang), enters the present-day streets of a Chinese city to pay for Adam’s and Eve’s sin. Lao Shi picks up a drunk middle-class man at a fancy hotel, and while driving to the drunk’s destination, the drunk, who sits beside him, suddenly grabs and turns the steering wheel. The car swerves and hits a man on a motorbike.  CHARLES MUDEDE Grand Illusion SUNDAY 3.  Spirited Away: 15th Anniversary Celebrate the 15th anniversary of Hayao Miyazaki's Academy Award-winning  Spirited Away , a visually enthralling anime about the destruction of innocence. It's basically two and a half hours of fantastical, vaguely terrifying uneasiness. "I'm sorry my sister turned your parents into pigs, but there's nothing I can do." Pacific Place ALL WEEKEND 4.  Arrival Arrival  is an ominous, thrumming, beautiful thing that starts out being about aliens who need a decoder ring. It ends up being about something quite different.  Arrival  is about Big Things—and the manner in which Villeneuve gets to them, as his camera slowly traces structures and landscapes both familiar and strange, can’t help but surprise and impress. Visually and aurally remarkable,  Arrival  sometimes unfolds like a clever puzzle and other times like a raw-nerve thriller; throughout, with heart and wit, Heisserer and Villeneuve never lose sight of the film’s characters—creatures in a situation that’s weird and mournful, exciting and threatening.  ERIK HENRIKSEN Various locations 5.  Die Hard A year after Fox Plaza, a 35-story tower in Century City, Los Angeles, was completed (1987), it starred in a film that brought it and Bruce Willis fame,  Die Hard . Fox Plaza plays Nakatomi Plaza, a building owned by a Japanese corporation, and Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a white NYC cop whose estranged white wife not only lives in LA but appears to have gone to the other side, the Japanese side. While McClane visits his wife at Nakatomi Plaza, things go crazy and we enter the world inside of the building: its elevator shafts, air ducts, and structural spaces. Here, postmodern architecture meets Reagan-era Hollywood cinema and makes lots of movie magic.  CHARLES MUDEDE Central Cinema 6.  Doctor Strange The psychedelic visuals, the clever asides, the pure pleasure of having as good an actor as Cumberbatch at the center of a silly superhero epic—all of that cast a spell on me, and I came out of the theater utterly content.  Doctor Strange  might have a lot of baggage, but more than anything else, it’s  fun .  SUZETTE SMITH Various locations 7.  The Eagle Huntress The Eagle Huntress  looks amazing. The documentary’s images—featuring a grinning 13-year-old Aisholpan Nurgaiv as she holds a splendid eagle half her size—are the stuff of myths. I went in pumped up to see a girl-power/girl-falconer documentary with plenty of big, cool-looking birds, and I was not disappointed. First-time director Otto Bell accomplishes a level of visual beauty we associate with BBC nature specials or, IDK,  Lord of the Rings ? It’s breathtaking.  SUZETTE SMITH Seven Gables 8.  The Edge of Seventeen Nadine is a type of teenage girl you've never seen before. She's  weird . She has dark eyes and sort of curly hair. All the kids at school hate her because she's very mature and kind of mean. She likes old movies and music. She is convinced that she has bigger and more serious problems than any of her peers. In a way, that's true. Her dad died suddenly when she was 13, and her family's sanity and strength took an understandable hit. Nadine is in many moments entirely predictable, and in others complex, burdened, and endearingly strange.  The Edge of Seventeen , an R-rated coming-of-age movie full of sass and sweetness, excels at embracing stereotypes and tropes—then immediately destroying them with funny and surprising writing.  JULIA RABAN Meridian 16  &  Sundance Cinemas 9.  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them "I'm annoying," says Eddie Redmayne to Dan Fogler in the opening half-hour of  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them . He’s like Doctor Who with gout, and yet—just like the good Doctor in even his lamest incarnations, there’s just enough charm glimmering beneath the surface and shining through the contrivances that you can’t write him off entirely.  Fantastic Beasts , featuring an original screenplay by J.K. Rowling, is annoying in the manner of Scamander: It is eager to please and amaze, but undersells its spectacle until that spectacle becomes perfunctory. It’s a goofy blast of kid-lit in love with Looney Tunes-inspired adventure—except when it’s a sour metaphor for child abuse and intolerance that owes one hell of a debt to Stephen King’s famous prom queen. But somehow, the two stories are sewed together  just  tightly enough that the TV pilot-esque clumsiness of  Fantastic Beasts  (there will be four more of these films, likely transforming ASAP into  The Dumbledore Prequels ) can be forgiven for the power in its climax.  BOBBY ROBERTS Various locations 10.  The Handmaiden Based on a novel set in the Victorian era by Welsh novelist Sarah Waters, the film's story happens during Japan's occupation of Korea (the 1930s) and concerns a young female thief who is placed in the middle of an elaborate plot to scam a Japanese countess. But the plan is further complicated by the unexpected sexual attraction that grips the young thief, Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri), and the countess, Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee), she works for as a handmaiden.  CHARLES MUDEDE Varsity Theatre 11.  Hunt for the Wilderpeople Sure,  Hunt for the Wilderpeople ’s scope is small, but it gives you everything you could want from a movie: It’s smart, emotional, and even a bit action-packed once Ricky and Hec embark on an unplanned adventure in the forest. But most of all, it’s funny. So, so funny.  Wilderpeople  is a hugely loveable movie that’s suitable for date night or the whole family, and I know that sounds like a hacky movie poster blurb. But when a movie’s this good, it’s tough to avoid clichés, so I’ll leave you with another: Don’t miss it.  NED LANNAMANN Varsity Theatre 12.  Manchester by the Sea In  Manchester , Lee Chandler (Affleck) seems content to shovel walkways and unclog toilets for a living in Boston, until word comes that his older brother Joe (Kyle Chandler, seen in flashbacks) has died of a heart attack. Joe’s will stipulates that he wants Lee to move back to his titular hometown and become Patrick’s guardian. Lee, however, is haunted by past events and resists, with a toddler’s tenacity, every effort by the people around him to help him come to terms. I feel for the guy, and you will too, but after two hours, I wanted to grab him by the collar and tell him to buck up. After all, he’s at least going to get an Oscar nomination out of it.  MARC MOHAN Various locations 13.  Moana Moana  is the Disney princess movie everyone needs right now—or, at the very least, Moana is the princess I've been dreaming of since I was a little girl. Not every kindergartner can see herself in  Cinderella ,  Sleeping Beauty , or, even nowadays,  Frozen . After years of witnessing people of color gunned down and beaten on-screen, having a whole movie dedicated to showcasing the knowledge and beauty of brown people felt restorative. Yes,  Moana  is an animated children's movie, but it is important for children of color to be able to see movie audiences sit in awe of their people's stories. Representation matters regardless of age.  ANA SOFIA KNAUF Various locations 14.  Moonlight Moonlight  is a film that has all of the major film critics in the country singing the loudest praises, and is already breaking box-office records, and happens to be a coming-of-age tale of a black American male. But I want to make this clear: The director of  Moonlight , Barry Jenkins, did not come out of nowhere. He also directed and wrote one of the best films of the previous decade,  Medicine for Melancholy  (2008). The wonder is that it took him so long to make his second feature, which will most likely make a big splash at the next Oscars. Expect Jenkins to be one of the few black Americans to win the award for best director.  CHARLES MUDEDE Various locations 15.  The Princess Bride EEveryone who can factually claim to be an American has seen  The Princess Bride  150 times. So why go see it on the big screen? Here's why: It's delightful and hilarious, and the goopy framing device gets out of the way fast, and there's that amazing scene where our heroine stands atop a hill, exclaims, "Oh, my love!" and hurls herself into a full-body roll. Plus, you can shout, “My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!” in a theater.   SIFF Film Center 16.  Rules Don't Apply TV may get all the shine nowadays, but old-fashioned movie-star charisma goes a long way. Case in point: Warren Beatty, who’s returned to movies after a 15-year hiatus. He wrote, directed, and stars in  Rules Don’t Apply , a wholly fictitious movie about billionaire Howard Hughes (Beatty) that foregrounds a forbidden romance between two of Hughes’s employees, starlet-in-the-making Marla Mabrey (Lily Collins) and her driver Frank Forbes (Alden Ehrenreich). Narratively, the movie’s a mess. But like a bowl of melted ice cream—in this case, Hughes’s preferred flavor, Baskin-Robbins’ Banana Nut—it’s still pretty delicious. That’s largely due to Beatty, who’s as fun to watch on-screen as he’s ever been. It’s  really  good to have him back.
