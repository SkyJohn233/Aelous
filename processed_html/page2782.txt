Training News - The North of England Urological Society I am pleased to announce that we have launched our new Associate membership category for the Surgical Care Team today. Please read more about the benefits and watch this video from Clare Sutherland, Advanced Clinical Practitioner. We have created this poster for you to display on any relevant noticeboards and you can follow our social media campaign @RCSNews using #surgicalcareteam. I also mentioned that we would be launching new guidance alongside the membership category for employers, surgeons and healthcare professionals. You can read the guidance online. The ultimate aim of these new developments is to enhance patient care, improve the effectiveness of services and support the quality of surgical training. As a representative of the RCS in the North East we hope that you will help us to spread the word among your colleagues and encourage them to join a growing professional community of more than 26,000 members across the UK and internationally. Once again, if you would like any further information please do not hesitate to contact me Jenna Cowling  Outreach Manager (South Hub) Royal College of Surgeons  35-43 Lincoln s Inn Fields  London WC2A 3PE  T: 020 7869 6231  E: Jcowling@rcseng.ac.uk  W:  www.rcseng.ac.uk
