Dark Sphere London LGS reviews? : magicTCG Hey there, I moved to the UK a year ago, I was just curious if anyone here frequents Dark Sphere, I had a few questions. How is the modern scene there? Do the scheduled Friday events always fire? Is it a large space? Unbelievably this is the easiest place to get back to Luton from at about midnight, If anyone has any other suggestions for places I &# x27;d love to hear them. I don &# x27;t go to FNM events or constructed in general, but I attend prereleases and drafts there. It &# x27;s probably the best (and biggest) shop in London to go to for events, and if any place will have its events fire, it &# x27;s Dark Sphere. From what I hear though, Modern and Standard tend to be quite popular so I don &# x27;t think you &# x27;ll have problems there. There &# x27;s an additional benefit in that it contains Legion City, which is the only physical MtG singles store in central London, and they &# x27;re really nice. It can get cramped on days like prereleases, but that &# x27;s only b/c they &# x27;re so popular. I do recommend it. Only been to Darksphere once (American studying abroad in London this semester) and it was for the Aether Revolt release. There were a large number of people there playing sealed and draft because of the release. There were also modern and standard players as well. There are a lot of tables and chairs to sit at and play games, but because of this, it &# x27;s kinda cramped and you &# x27;re constantly bumping into people trying to go different directions. The store is also right under a train/tube and lines run above the building every 20 minutes or so. Overall it is a nice place and I plan on going back for FNM and draft events on a regular basis. 366k Members 3.7k Online Oct 3, 2008 Cake Day
