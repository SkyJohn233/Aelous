JasperReports Server: Input Controls error - Stack Overflow                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 My question relates to an error when generating a report. In  JasperReports Server  created a Single Input Control Value but when you try to generate a report I get the error: In the preview  iReport  everything works flawlessly. I will put the value and generates a report. if you mean a single value by "Single Input Control Value" it should not be a collection. So Change your  SelectAsset  parameter type from  java.util.Collection  to  java.lang.String Then redeploy your report to the server then try again.
