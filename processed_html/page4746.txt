We want you to know you can trust us to respect your privacy and keep your personal information safe.     As of May 25, 2018, we're aligning with the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).     We see this as a great opportunity to show you exactly what we do with the information you give us permission to have. And in helping us to understand you better,    we can enhance your experience with Tobii Dynavox.     The Data Protection Regulation allows you to have more control over what happens to your information too. For instance, if you don't want our news and offers anymore,     we'll stop sending them to you. Of course, we'll keep you informed about things like your order or any product or services you've bought from us.     Please take some time to read our updated privacy policy which explains what data we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, who we share it with and other     information relating to the privacy of your data.     Please note that in some cases, your data may be subject to other protective legislation other than the GDPR. For example, some data that is stored in the United States     may be protected under federal and state regulation, such as The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).
