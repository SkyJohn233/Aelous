Lafayette High School (Virginia) - Wikipedia Lafayette High School  is a public secondary school in  James City County, Virginia , just outside the city limits of  Williamsburg, Virginia .  It is part of  Williamsburg-James City County Public Schools  and is located at 4460 Longhill Road. Lafayette High School opened in 1973 and served as the sole high school for  James City County  and  Williamsburg City .  The school itself is located in James City County though it has a Williamsburg mailing address. In 1997, half of its student body with the exception of rising seniors were moved to  Jamestown High School  which opened to alleviate overcrowding at Lafayette.  The Williamsburg area began to develop rapidly in the late 1990s and 2000s, which prompted the opening of  Warhill High School  in 2007. Students were forced to redistrict. The main office is located right at the main entrance of the school. The wide hallway opens up into the "upper commons". The cafeteria is located in this area. There are three lines for purchasing food. The auditorium is located to the left. Three large hallways branch out from the "upper commons." A smaller hallway leads to the girls locker room and the weight room used for athletic training. The first hallway across from the main office leads to the marketing classes, the gymnasium, the boys locker room, and the trailers, which will no longer be in use after the 2007–08 school year. There are two hallways which parallel the sides the auditorium. The first is known as the ramp. Another hallway at the top of the ramp leads to the fine arts classrooms. The other hallway leads to "the stairs. Another hallway branches off here as well. It leads to the mathematics and art classrooms. At the end of "the ramp" and "the stairs" is the "lower commons." The lower commons is a smaller gathering area that is busy when classes are changing. The Media Center is located at the back of the "lower commons." A loop goes around the media center. On one side is the semicircular world language and science hallway. On the outside of the semicircle is a pair of well equipped computer labs. On the other side is the social studies and technology hallway. At the back of the loop surrounding the Media Center is the entrance/exit to the bus loop. Two hallways branch off from the "lower commons." One leads to the small lecture hall and the fine arts hallway. The other leads to math hallway and the social studies hallway. † New high schools opened in each of these years, leading to students being reassigned. As of the 2012–2013 school year, Lafayette High School's student body was 61% (667) White; 25% (276) Black; 7% (79) Hispanic; 3% (29) Asian; and 4% (47) other.

Lafayette is known in the school district for having a parade in Colonial Williamsburg that features each class making a float to accompany their class princes/princesses/kings/queens. A number of clubs also participate as well. One year, the Operation Smile club hosted a Sadie Hawkens Dance as a fundraiser. The sophomore class at one point held their Ring Dance at the school. Prom and After Prom have also been held at the school in past years. The school also has pep rallies for every sports season (Fall, Winter, and Spring).

[ 5 ] The Lafayette Band program has won grand championships at several band festivals since the school opened in the early '70s under the direction of D. Keith Miller. During the period of the early '80s "Corp" style marching programs was introduced by Director Miller and carried on by Directors John Ford and Director David Smith. The fledgling marching program was making great strides with the new competitive program and with the introduction of a solid marching program that further inspired the students to raise Lafayette's band program to a higher level. The latter '80s brought a change when acclaimed Director Alan Wright took over changing the program back to concert format band. The band consistently received Superior Ratings and was viewed as one of the top concert and jazz band programs in the state. When Director Wright retired in the early 2000s, the new Director T. Jonathan Hargis reestablished the marching program. Mr. Chris Smith directed the band for a short time as Hargis had stints at Warhill HS and Berkeley Middle Schools. Hargis returned in Fall 2014. In the fall of 2019 the Marching Band received their first Superior rating. Lafayette has a number of clubs that have been around for years.
