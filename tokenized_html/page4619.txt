corcoran physics 6 conclusion the conclusion is where you discuss whether your hypothesis was correct or not what that means and critique your experimental procedure and results the conclusion must include -your hypothesis restated and then directly concluded upon this means you must decide whether the data you have collected supports or does not support your initial hypothesis -support for your conclusion statement using the important data from your data section that you are using to make your conclusion these are the facts that you are basing your argument on without them you are basically stating an opinion -a discussion of your experimental results this is where you show that you can intelligently discuss the experiment that you just performed you should be talking about what the results mean this involves you making connections you should be looking back at your introduction and seeing what we knew about the ideas involved in this lab before doing this experiment and explaining how doing this lab has either strengthened changed or furthered any of those understandings you can also make connections to experiences you may have or to properly cited outside research done after doing the experiment you can discuss whether the results you encountered were a realistic expectation for what will always happen with this experiment or you could talk about why you think the results turned out the way they did in some labs you may be given lab questions that will be included here or replace this section or ask you to work your answers into this section -an explanation of possible sources of error and how those errors would change the results of the experiments i expect you to completely discuss at least two significant sources of error there are two types of error to look for measurement error and systemic error measurement error is in every lab to varying degrees this can be broken down into two issues accuracy and precision error in accuracy would be saying that your measuring device gives results that are not near the actual value an example would be a spring scale where the spring has been stretched out from overuse and now it gives values that are much larger than the actual force being applied we generally trust our equipment to be accurate but you can not rule this out precision error is due to the limitation in any of our instruments that they are only so precise and therefore can only go to so many decimal places for example our meter sticks are marked down to the millimeter this means that any measurement that we make is limited to +/- .0005m meaning you could be off by as much as a half a millimeter in either direction when you take that measurement simply because that it a limitation of the device note neither of these are human error they are measurements done by humans but are limitations in our measurement devices systemic error is error caused by us making assumptions within our procedure for example if we were trying to predict the velocity of a car moving down a ramp and in order to get that prediction mathematically we assumed the ramp was frictionless because that makes the math easier we would say that neglecting friction while making our prediction was a source of error that would cause our result to be slower than the prediction this is because friction would always slow down something rolling down a ramp not speed it up these are not mistakes but rather acknowledgments that we made assumptions that may not be 100 accurate an outline of a follow up experiment to the one you just did explain briefly what you would test and how it would connect to the concepts of this lab this should allow you to learn more about the same topics helpful hints if you want you can use the hypothesis that ______ has been found to be supported not supported by the data taken in this experiment. as your opening statement just be cautious of using this with longer hypothesis as it can become a pretty awkward sentence one way to think about sources of error is to say to yourself what are some things that we assumed to be 100 true that may not have been for example if you were dropping something in the experiment and you assumed it dropped from complete rest it is possible that you let it go and pushed it in one direction or another that would have given it some initial velocity common mistakes -concluding that the data was kind of supported don t straddle the fence there are often cases where the data could be argued to support or reject the hypothesis so pick a side and argue it if you aren t including numbers from your data section you aren t supporting your conclusion properly mistakes are not errors mistakes can be ﬁxed by being more careful you would have to change your procedure to ﬁx a source of error never say human error there are errors that occur because measurements are not exact due to people taking the measurements even when they are taking them to the best of their ability we discuss this as error in the precision of the instrument and the uncertainty of the measurement if we had a more precise instrument then a human could get a better reading if the measurement is obviously wrong because of a human error then it is a mistake because you can go back be more careful and get a better result if this is the case you are allowed to discount this outlying data a follow up experiment is not do the same experiment over again but have machines do it so the measurements are exact. you would be surprised how many times i have read this in a lab this shows that you are not thinking about what you ve learned and how you can increase that knowledge
