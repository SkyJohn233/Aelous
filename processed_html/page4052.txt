About Us - Springfield, Illinois | Sangamon County Republican Central Committee For official purposes, this organization is made up of Republican Precinct Committeemen elected or appointed from each of the 182 precincts in Sangamon County.  These committeemen then select a Chairman to serve as their leader.  However, our membership is generally viewed as much broader in scope, including Republicans who are elected officials, affiliated Republican club presidents and club members, and active volunteers and donors.  The combination of everyone together and their efforts make the SCRCC one of the strongest Republican organizations in Illinois. If you would like to participate with other Sangamon County Republicans, please feel free to join us through one of our website opportunities or by calling our Headquarters at 217-528-6267.
