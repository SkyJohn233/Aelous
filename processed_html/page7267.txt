What are Kant ' s duty ethics? - Quora a KV d wLYkc YIM b g y cy xCe D F u E c zyEZa k IYsFJ D Ws u OE c GBgSe k oScbI G MOF o oMIO Kant’s conception of what is virtuous is to do what the law requires. Why? Well, suppose I break a law like “don’t lie.” For Kant this one was big. If my action were universalized so that everyone mirrored me, Kant was worried we’d all go around lying to each other and society would just go off the rails. (Wasn’t a stupid guy I guess.) That’s Kant’s big test: can something be universalized, would it still result in a kosher system? Well, it’s pretty simple if everyone follows the law, that passes the test. We might disagree with Kant about whether it is always right to follow the law. For me there is something about deontology that seems to lack basic human elements, and it always struck me that ethics should be about what is most and uniquely human. Say your friend has cancer and is sitting in the hospital with not very much longer to live. For Kant, you should go visit the person because you have a duty to be kind to your friends and treat them well. Notably, Kant does not say you should go visit your friend  just because it’s your friend . p J r VdvTc o q m VQ o E t AT e IvQH d usszc Os b pj y Iuv JOsra M FG I tOKA N hGp I sl Zi U IfTC S hNQd A O 2,787 Views 31,301 Views 20,325 Views 21,533 Views 1,691 Views p o r xGmR o Sk m LhZ o MT t bqRK e M d QFWX zErol b mCpuH y irni aDfus P vBrcl o tLD l Va i WFa c o y umPC g Gjyjs e Ep n Bq i Q u bn s A Kant ' s version of duty-based ethics was based on something that he called  ' the categorical imperative '  which he intended to be the basis of all other rules (a  ' categorical imperative '  is a rule that is true in all circumstances.) 2,787 Views 21,533 Views 20,325 Views 2,356 Views 1,691 Views 2,565 Views 3,540 Views 96,595 Views 2,235 Views 608 Views 462 Views 5,108 Views 530 Views 1,544 Views 2,801 Views
