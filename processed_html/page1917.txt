Mostly I love how easy the top is to keep clean Bottom Line  Yes, I would recommend to a friend  Was this review helpful to you? 0 0 Submitted   20 days ago  By  BecksB  From  Minneapolis, MN Verified Buyer Verified Buyer Verified Buyer Reviewed at This was installed by the builder, as I did not get to select this particular range.  To this day (3 years after close) the oven omits a chemical smell when in use.  To the point where my poor pup wheezes.  I ' ve scrubbed it many times, using vinegar and baking soda, and it ' s still there 3 years later.  Customer Service was no help.Oven and stovetop take exceptionally long to heat up.  I ' ve had better performing electric ranges in the past.

It replaced a 1980s range which was failing on us. It ' s so spacious and well thought of. I really like it.

I can no longer store the same amount of pots like before.

We chose this range specifically because we used its Delay Start feature regularly with our previous Whirlpool range.  Whirlpool corporate told our technician that the user manual does not coincide with the actual range and it is not going to be remedied.  Too bad for us.  We must now activate Delay Start the way a dishwasher delay start is activated.   Cumbersome.

I don ' t like the fact that the clock goes off when the range is in use. Our last range could display the oven temperature and the time at the same time, this is good when you need to leave an item in the oven for a certain time. Also the storage area below the oven is too small, not capable of storing any pots. I realize the oven space is large but I would give up some oven capacity for more storage space below. I don ' t like the care and attention the glass top requires. I would want a much steadier heartier range top, one that can handle some spills. I would not recommend this product.

Searched for 2 months but this is perfect Bottom Line  Yes, I would recommend to a friend  Was this review helpful to you? 0 0 Submitted   2 months ago  By  Cookie#1  From  Seattle,Wa. Verified Buyer Verified Buyer Verified Buyer Submitted as part of a sweepstakes entry Reviewed at I would not chose this one again, disappointed in the features. Nothing fits in the drawer too shallow. Cook top takes work to keep clean. The stainless scratches easily. You must hold on to the pans or they could slip off while stirring food. I do like Whirlpool and might would try a different model if I were to buy again.
