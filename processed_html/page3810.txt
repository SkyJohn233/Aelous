Photophysical properties of pyridyloxy phthalocyanine encapsulated in nanoparticles: Spectroscopy Letters: Vol 51, No 6 Two aluminum chloride phthalocyanines with pyridyloxy substitution at α/β positions were synthesized. Their structures were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance as well as elemental analysis. Tetra-α(β)-(2-pyridyloxy) aluminum chloride phthalocyanines were encapsulated into a diblock copolymer methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(L-lysine) through a cosolvent method. The morphologies and photophysical properties of phthalocyanines encapsulated in nanoparticles were studied by transmission electron microscope, ultraviolet-visible, and fluorescence spectroscopic methods. The photophysical properties of phthalocyanines encapsulated into nanoparticles exhibited substitution positions dependence. The phthalocyanines with substitution at α positions were found to be an excellent candidate for use as photosensitizers for treatment of cancer by photodynamic therapy.
