Port 1961 (tcp/udp) :: SpeedGuide  back to SG Ports External Resources SANS Internet Storm Center: port 1961 Notes: Well Known Ports: 0 through 1023. Registered Ports: 1024 through 49151. Dynamic/Private : 49152 through 65535. TCP ports use the Transmission Control Protocol. TCP is the most commonly used protocol on the Internet and any TCP/IP network. Whereas the IP protocol deals only with packets, TCP enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data. TCP guarantees delivery of data and that packets will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent. Guaranteed communication/delivery is the key difference between TCP and UDP. UDP ports use the Datagram Protocol, a communications protocol for the Internet network, transport, and session layers. Like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP is used with IP (the Internet Protocol) and makes possible the transmission of datagrams from one computer to applications on another computer, but unlike TCP, UDP is connectionless and does not guarantee reliable communication; it's up to the application that received the message to process any errors and verify correct delivery. UDP is often used with time-sensitive applications, such as audio/video streaming, where dropping some packets is preferable to waiting for delayed data. When troubleshooting unknown open ports, it is useful to find exactly what services/processes are listening to them.     This can be accomplished in both Windows command prompt and Linux variants using the "netstat -aon" command.     We also recommend runnig multiple anti-virus/anti-malware scans to rule out the possibility of active malicious software.    For more detailed and personalized help please use our forums.
