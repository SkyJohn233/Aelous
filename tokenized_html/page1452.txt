for any sale through our links we earn a small commission your price is unaffected for more information please see our disclosure policy my mother-in-law is a professional when it comes to making persian koobideh kabob ground beef kabobs you know ground meat on a skewer it sounds easy but it s an art form to cook pieces of meat or chicken over an open flame if the mixture is off by an ingredient the whole thing falls off the skewer and into the hot coals and the kabobs must remain moist and tender practically melting in your mouth certainly not like thick heavy meat patties my mother-in-law s master hands work quickly she has lovingly and selflessly made these kabobs for her family as long as she can remember first for her children and her husband and now for her grandchildren daughter-in-law and extended family my own grandmother was also a master in making koobideh but she is gone now and i never had the opportunity to learn from her so one afternoon i invited my mother-in-law over and we made koobideh together i watched her work her magic and learned her koobideh recipe persian kabob is pretty special there are many varieties available from beef to chicken to lamb koobideh kabob is made with ground beef sometimes it is a mixture of ground lamb and beef depending on personal taste this version is a simple recipe that my mother-in-law makes every time we come over for a delicious meal of homemade koobideh and like most home cooks both my mother-in-law and my grandmother do not work in exact measurements they measure everything by sight and feel so i would run to the measuring spoons to make sure i wrote everything down exactly as my mother-in-law explained in it s simplest form this koobideh recipe is with ground beef 20 fat grated onions drained of excess water salt and pepper sometimes i like to add some chopped parsley mint and even garlic powder to the mix but my mother-in-law keeps the mixture super simple don t let these simple ingredients fool you it is all about how koobideh kabob is prepared that makes it special as i explained earlier if your meat does not have enough fat on it it will fall off the skewers as it cooks if your meat has too much moisture on it it will fall off the skewers if your meat doesn t have enough moisture it will fall off the skewers if your meat isn t mixed thoroughly well you get the picture the onions are first grated in the food processor my mother-in-law then adds this onion mixture to the blender to pur√©e it even more i ve skipped this step because well i m lazy and my koobideh still turns out beautifully the idea is to grate your onions as fine as possible and then strain out the liquid but do not discard it that onion juice is used later the meat massaging process takes a lot of time i won t lie to you first you mix the meat and the grated onions in the food processor until you get a big ball that whirls around the bowl then you mix the meat mixture massaging it by hand as you would pizza dough for about 20 minutes my daughter was only 3-years old at the time of this koobideh lesson she loved every minute of it and even helped out my girl loved working with the meat patties probably because it reminded her of play doh she s 13 now and she still loves squishing around with pizza dough koobideh mix play-doh and slime my boys also enjoyed making kabob with their maman as did the other grandchildren who are now too old and too cool to be seen massaging ground beef they know that their meal is a lot of work to prepare but their grandmother does it with a smile and a heart full of love you want the meat to be fluffy as my mother-in-law explains this is not hamburger the meat mixture should be airy and not super sticky you dip your hands in the onion water as you mix the meat and later on when you massage it onto the skewer do let your mixture sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours at least so that the onions and meat melt together this is another tricky situation but you get the hang of it after lots of practice you start with a softball size amount of koobideh mix and pierce it down to the center of your skewer again you are using flat metal skewers and not thin bamboo skewers you do not want your kabab koobideh spinning around on a thin skewer once your softball of koobideh is in the center of your skewer use one hand to squeeze it and massage it onto the skewer the center of the skewer will be filled with the koobideh mix you need to leave several inches off the ends of the skewers open so it can sit properly on your grill knowing how big your grill opening is also decides how long you can make your koobideh kabob when we are at maman s house for a kabob dinner the kids are gathered around her as she grills the kabob turning each skewer at just the right time for even cooking my mother-in-law sneaks bites of kabob fresh off the girl and feeds them to the kids who typically are the last to be served dinner after their elders serve themselves first your koobideh mix should wrap around the skewer but not be bulky so for the engineers out there who need exact measurements we are talking about a half an inch of meat on the top and a half an inch of meat along the bottom of the skewer using two fingers to mimic scissors the forefinger and index finger scissor the meat down the skewer to make the bumps you normally see in koobideh kabob the ends of the koobideh mix should not be open use your fingers to pinch the ends sealing it shut to the skewer all the while as you work dip your hands in the reserved onion juice or regular water to keep the meat from sticking to your hand amzn_assoc_placement adunit0 amzn_assoc_search_bar true amzn_assoc_tracking_id familyspice07-20 amzn_assoc_ad_mode

b07kwshbjv b07mlyskbb b003fzavu6 grilling persian kabob is all about getting down to the basics you do not need a fancy grill in fact i have memories of my grandmother sitting on her haunches fanning the flames of her little hibachi-style charcoal grill my husband rigged his mother s gas grill with metal stands so the skewers of meat sit above the open flame now she can stand easily and not crouch over a low grill the hubby has found that those big stainless steel chaffing pans are a cheap and efficient way to grill koobideh kabob or any kabob for that matter you can also cook your koobideh kabob in one of these kabob grills that are specifically designed to lay skewers of meat over hot coals without crouching or bending over you can cook koobideh in the oven when you do not have a grill my american dad has perfected this technique and cooks koobideh this way all the time you do not need skewers if you cooking your kabob in the oven you will need a broiler pans like this one to place the kabob on form the meat into elongated fat hot dog shaped kabobs about 1-inch thick and 6-inches long place each kabob on the top pan you want to use both pans so that the drippings will fall below the kabob leave at least 1-inch between each kabob you don t want to over crowd the pan heat the oven on broil for at least 10 minutes so your oven is piping hot you also want the oven rack to be place on the top level once your oven is hot place your pan full of koobideh kabob in the oven and cook for about 10 minutes then turn kabob over and continue cooking for 10 more minutes or until juices run clear when my family has a hankering for koobideh kabob and it s a busy school night then many times i just cook up my kabob in a pan on the stove this version is called kabob-e deeg or kabob from a pot i mix the koobideh as i would for skewering form the kabobs like you do for the oven but smaller maybe 4-inches long then heat a pan add some olive oil or melt some butter and brown your kabob on every side until done easy peasy kabob in a flash because koobideh making is a bit challenging it is the most popular meal to order at persian restaurants but despite our adventures eating kabob at restaurants my kids always agree it s never as good as maman s kabob this is one family recipe i will definitely pass down to my children and of course to my own grandchildren read my husband s favorite way to enjoy chelo kabab and koobideh kabob here this can also be made with a mixture of beef and lamb but for practicality purposes we primarily use ground beef again low-fat 10 fat or less ground meat is not recommended for this technique you need the fat for flavor and to help the meat stick to the skewer please use 20 fat ground beef much of the fat will burn off during the grilling process and you are left with moist and tender skewers of koobideh kabob to enjoy my mother-in-law took the time to teach me and my little girl how to make koobideh kabob ground beef kabob on the grill in the oven or on the stove serving suggestions serve with basmati rice or lavash bread cooking tips the ingredients are simple but the technique is key you want the meat mixture to be sticky enough to stay on the skewers and not fall off during the grilling process long flat skewers work best with this kabob to cook in the oven form kabob mix into desired shape and place onto a broiler pan coated with non-stick spray broil in the oven on the top-most shelf until kabob starts to brown about 5-7 mins turn kabob over broil for 5 more mins or until cooked through this step can be skipped the secret to great ground beef kabob is to make sure your onions are pureed very smoothly you do n't want to taste the onion pieces as you would in a hamburger the texture is very

persian recipes lois says at this is always my favorite meal at your place watching your husband grill the meat skewers over his make shift grill is half the fun the other half is listening to his stories of growing up in iran laura bashar says at and i believe you were just invited for another night of kabob at our house lois says at really we re so making that happen we love sharing food fun and family with you all eha says at thank you for a wonderfully informative lesson the ingredients are so simple but i fear the method will take some time have never made a mixture this way and have always been taught mince should be handled as little as possible üôÇ very interesting and shall soon try to see whether i can get it right have the right skewers oh and love the family photos enjoyable post laura bashar says at eha until my mother-in-law showed me how to do it i wasn t very successful making kabob either the food processor may become a mess to cleanup afterwards but it fluffs the meat beautifully and my kabob never fall off the skewers let me know how it works for you eha says at sent this to some friends and quite a few wrote back to say they would subscribe yes shall tell you when i get a reasonable result üôÇ chris thorne says at i absolutely love this recipe but i scares me to death making them because of how easy they fall off of the skewer i think the closer the meat comes to room temperature the more likely they are going to fall off no matter how evenly you rotate them i use a yogurt strainer to strain my onion puree and reserve the juice in case i need it the juice is great to freeze and add to soups later family spice says at it is always a challenge to keep the meat from falling off the skewers if you have a refrigerator big enough to hold the skewered meat then yes keep it cold here in san diego our nights are cool so we are able to keep it cool sitting out on the table the onion juice is definitely a secret flavor weapon great idea on freezing it mohammad says at hello sir i m mohammad from iran and i know english a little put the meat and onion mixture in the refrigerator for 3 hours before cooking family spice says at yes this lets the meat flavors meld together and helps it stay on the skewer jen says at perfect recipe thank you for sharing family spice says at you re very welcome jenni says at dang laura these sound
