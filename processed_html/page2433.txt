Flood and Water Damage Restoration Best Practices Water damage happens all too often, whether it’s an issue with plumbing or some other water source. The Institute of Inspection Cleaning and Restoration Certification (IICRC) has set an industry standard to classify water damage so professionals can assess the problem properly and follow industry practices for remediation. The IICRC established S-500 standards to categorize the type of water involved. Additionally, they included classes of destruction to help professionals develop the best plan of action for restoring the property. The classifications for damage are as follows: Category 1 refers to a water disaster that involves sources of clean water. The source is usually a toilet tank, a drinking fountain or a water faucet. The water is always sanitary and clean, but if it isn’t cleaned up quickly, it can become contaminated and lead to a Category 2 water loss. Category 2 water loss involves water that was once called grey water. Grey water is water that has contaminants that would cause illness if ingested. The contaminants can be biological, chemical or physical. Common sources are washing machine overflow, dishwasher overflow, sump pump failures, flush from sink drains and toilet overflow with urine only. Category 3 is the worst classification possible and refers to a situation that is extremely unsanitary and hazardous to your health. If ingested, this water could cause serious illness or death. It was once called black water and may contain heavy metals, organic matters, silt, pesticides or toxic organic substances. Common sources of black water include toilet overflow with feces, sewer backup, stagnant liquid with bacterial growth and flooding from streams or rivers. Powered by  Andava
