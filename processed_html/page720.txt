Blur | Biography  &  History | AllMusic + Follow Artist Innovative, ever-morphing Brit-pop band with punch that nabbed constant critical adulation and the occasional massive hit. Read Full Biography                                         Initially,  Blur  were one of the multitude of British bands that appeared in the wake of  the Stone Roses , mining the same swirling, pseudo-psychedelic guitar pop, only with louder guitars. Following an image makeover in the mid- ' 90s, the group emerged as the most popular band in the U.K., establishing itself as heir to the English guitar pop tradition of  the Kinks ,  the Small Faces ,  the Who ,  the Jam ,  Madness , and  the Smiths . In the process, the group broke down the doors for a new generation of guitar bands that became labeled as Brit-pop. With  Damon Albarn ' s wry lyrics and the group ' s mastery of British pop tradition,  Blur  were the leader of Brit-pop, but they quickly became confined by the movement; since they were its biggest band, they nearly died when the movement itself died. Through some reinvention,  Blur  reclaimed their position as an art pop band in the late  ' 90s by incorporating indie rock and lo-fi influences, which finally gave them their elusive American success in 1997. But the band ' s legacy remained in Britain, where they helped revitalize guitar pop by skillfully updating the country ' s pop traditions.                                                         Originally called  Seymour , the group was formed in London in 1989 by vocalist/keyboardist  Albarn  along with guitarist  Graham Coxon  and bassist  Alex James , with drummer  Dave Rowntree  joining the lineup shortly afterward. After performing a handful of gigs and recording a demo tape, the band signed to Food Records, a subsidiary of EMI run by journalist  Andy Ross  and former  Teardrop Explodes  keyboardist  Dave Balfe .  Balfe  and  Ross  suggested that the band change its name, submitting a list of alternate names for the group ' s approval. From that list, the group took the name  Blur .                 XTC ' s  Andy Partridge  was originally slated to produce  Modern Life Is Rubbish , but the relationship between  Blur  and  Partridge  quickly soured, so  Street  was again brought in to produce the band. After spending nearly a year in the studio, the band delivered the album to Food. The record company rejected it, declaring that it needed a hit single.  Blur  went back into the studio and recorded  Albarn ' s  " For Tomorrow, "  which would turn out to be a British hit. Food was ready to release the record, but the group ' s U.S. record company, SBK, believed there was no American hit single on the record and asked them to return to the studio.  Blur  complied and recorded  " Chemical World, "  which pleased SBK for a short while; the song would become a minor alternative hit in the U.S. and charted at number 28 in the U.K.  Modern Life Is Rubbish  was set for release in the spring of 1993 when SBK asked  Blur  to re-record the album with producer  Butch Vig  ( Nirvana ,  Sonic Youth ). The band refused and the record was released in May in Britain; it appeared in the United States that fall.  Modern Life Is Rubbish  received good reviews in Britain, peaking at number 15 on the charts, yet it failed to make much of an impression in the U.S.                 Blur  continued to play shows into 2013; one of these included a gig in Hong Kong that was cancelled. The band used the downtime to record a bunch of material that lay unused until  Coxon  started working with producer  Stephen Street  to turn them into completed tracks in November of 2014. Soon, a full album came into shape.  Blur  announced the release of this record, now entitled The Magic Whip, for April of 2015.
