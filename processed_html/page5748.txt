Vitasta. Pages 362. Rs 695. F OR          its composite cultural heritage, vast hoard of dynasts and tempestuous          last few decades, Kashmir has ever served as an inexhaustible,          monumental subject of history. However, what oriented Suneethi Bakshi          to tread the often beaten track of writing Kashmir’s history—the          valorous, valiant Kashmir Pandit women who have preserved their          identity and culture despite a history of ordeals and vicissitudes          they braved?  " In their patriarchal society, Kashmiri Pandits have          always treated women as lesser beings `85 it is difficult to visualise          a time when she was not a victim of grave injustice and tyranny, used          and abused by men in her life. "  Hence, an oppressive patriarchal          framework has been the bane of Kashmiri Pandit women, says the author. Besides, Bakshi          discusses how the Kashmiri Pandit community, especially the women          folk, fared through the vast array of Hindu, Muslim and Sikh          dynasties. Her conclusion is that in the exclusive Hindu eras,          Kashmiri Pandit women relatively had an easier time and a batter          status. However, their lot deteriorated with the advent of Islam and          regular persecutions in its wake. To save them, their movement was          restricted by their menfolk. And to prevent their abduction, the          stifling purdah system was adopted. In brief, the rampant violence in          Kashmir has jeopardised women’s freedom and been the other cause of          their victimisation, besides patriarchy. However, the author          enumerates illustrious women, who, despite cramping, crippling          encroachments, fought the cause of their identity, flouting stifling          patriarchal norms and contributed to Kashmir’s prestige and honour. The author has written          this book to raise their hitherto scanted status and to bring into          prominence the pioneering Pandit women in various fields in the          post-Independence period, the author. Hence a feminist perspective has          been adopted to the chronology, culture and available records of          Kashmir. She deplores the fact no          material or written treatise of Kashmiri women from antecedent times          has survived. She praises the historian Kalhana for his voracious,          unbiased interpretation of his times and accentuates his  Rajatarangini ,          the monumental extant record of Kashmir having information about          extraordinary Kashmir women till the 11th century. Besides Kalhana,          she credits Bilhana, an 11th-century Kashmiri poet laureate, for          recording the high intellectual attainments of his contemporary women. She attacks the          patriarchal biases of the Hindu historians of the time for not          mentioning Lal Ded (Lalleshwari), the 14th-century mystic and          spiritual adept, best known for her  vaakhs  in Kashmiri          language. The foremost resister to Brahmin patriarchy, thus, died          unrecognised. Only Muslim historians recognised her much later. The author highlights          the similarities in Habba Khatoon, Arnimal and Roopabhavani, the          renowned Kashmiri women poets and saints—victims of abuse by their          husband or in-laws. They freed themselves from the tyranny of          patriarchy, created a niche for themselves in literary and spiritual          world. A close connection          persists between history and biography. Hence, a long line of          biographical sketches of the rulers of Kashmir form nucleus of the          historical narrative, explaining major influences on Kashmir. If the          dissolute, spendthrift rulers are denounced for ruining Kashmir, Kota          Rani, the last of the Hindu queens, is specifically eulogised for her          indomitable energy. Her administrative calibre and keen sense of          diplomacy are particularly underlined, with which she confronted the          corruptions of her times and resuscitated the Hindu dynasty. The last part of the          book expresses concern about the contemporary appalling conditions of          Kashmir. Her critical assessment of Kashmir problem has both          retrospective and prospective value; it aims to aid Kashmiri youth to          extricate themselves from the historical predicament. This well-researched          historical narrative inspires a degree pf loyalty to Kashmiri Pandit          identity and culture in the new generations of Kashmiri Pandits,          alienated from the Valley, binding them to their cultural moorings.          Written in the honour of Kashmiri Pandit women, the value of the saga          of feminine valour to women’s studies is significant. HOME
