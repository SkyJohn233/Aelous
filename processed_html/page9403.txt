Welcome to the Jewish West | Harriet Rochlin  &  Western Jewish History "I just finished reading  So Far Away , and I couldn't put it down. It was so good, I hated to see it end."  - Sylvia Arden, Head Librarian/Archivist, San Diego Historical Society JEWS CAME WEST At best, it was a wide-open wonderland. At worst, better than where they came from. 1849--1,000 2014--1,640,200  Slightly more than fifty years ago, the ethnic history movement awakened interest in the unrecorded histories of the nation's minorities, including the Jews in the American West. Once begun, the search inspired the organization of Western Jewish historical societies, museums, and archives.  Some astonishing pioneer memoirs and novels were put back in print, and present-day historians and biographers have published dozens of new works. Drawing on these new and varied resources, authors and screenwriters  have  written a few  novels and films, and  more are in progress.   With some 400 years to draw on, starting with the crypto Jews who settled in Spanish Texas and New Mexico, Western Jewish history abounds with male and female personalities and trailblazing deeds and misdeeds. It also offers fresh insights into how Jews retained their identity while  pioneering under hostile and hospitable conditions.  Who we were, who we are, and who we are becoming is gradually emerging from these vital and richly variegated roots. - Harriet Rochlin.  RochlinRootsWest@gmail.com
