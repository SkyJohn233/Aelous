Just out of curiosity though, what are her react feats like? Mismatch. Possible Spite.  HOM Wanda stomps Mismatch, HOM Wanda was a multi-versal threat....  @saren Maximoff can probably solo the New 52. Why do you hate Wonder Woman so much.. HoM Wanda. What could Wanda do to stop Diana from blitzing and chopping Wanda's head clean off before she could even react? Answer me that.  Hasnt this user already been warned about making mismatch/spite threads? Hasnt this user already been warned about making mismatch/spite threads? No bc I rarely, if ever, make mismatches. @serrure :  @uugieboogie :  @cgoodness :  @ssj_god  : Lol, please read all the comments. What could Wanda do to stop Diana from blitzing and chopping Wanda's head clean off before she could even react? Answer me that. Ah, thanks for correcting me on this. As Scarlet Bish also doesn't have any neck durability feats, then well, Diana stomps.   Whats stopping WW from decapitating SW before she can react :$    Hasnt this user already been warned about making mismatch/spite threads? I hope he gets banned, almost positive he is a troll...... @cgoodness :   Nothing.  JK.  Hasnt this user already been warned about making mismatch/spite threads? EDIT: I hope he gets  banned appointed to moderate this forum . almost positive he is a  troll rustler. ..... @thenaughtytitan :  His name alone should give that away @thenaughtytitan :  His name alone should give that away Yup, I gave him the benefit of the doubt at first thinking maybe he had a goofy name but that paired with his obvious and unfunny trolling makes it clear he is a troll....  We got the point. @thenaughtytitan :  His name alone should give that away EDIT: Yup, I gave him the benefit of the doubt at first thinking maybe he had a goofy name but that paired with his obvious and hilarious rustling makes it clear he is has a huge ____.... @thenaughtytitan :  His name alone should give that away EDIT: Yup, I gave him the benefit of the doubt at first thinking maybe he had a goofy name but that paired with his obvious and hilariously bad trolling makes it clear he is has a huge ego, he tends to overcompensate because he has a small ______.......  HOM Wanda. Depending on her neck resistance feats of course. WW stomps :p HOM Wanda stomps,  @jimmy_rustler :  are you trying to get banned?  Multiversal reality warper  >  Wonder Woman. @vance_astro @god_spawn HOM Wanda stomps,  @jimmy_rustler :  are you trying to get banned? Thats what he has been doing since day one, look at his name lol.... HOM Wanda stomps,  @jimmy_rustler :  are you trying to get banned? No, why? Someone's back at it lol WW gets erased @jimmy_rustler :  wanda unless ww utilizes her speed @thenaughtytitan :   These are pretty good. Are you talking about the herc pics? Wish I made them but I just found them in google images lol..... @jimmy_rustler :  wanda unless ww utilizes her speed Morals are off so wouldn't she instinctively go for the blitz play? Mismatch Mismatch How? Spite But what about them reaction feats? I mean i know we have a multiversal reality warper here, but if WBH with all his omnidirectional gamma burst that incinerates characters on WW level couldn't help him from being decapitated, what's a feeble woman like Wanda gonna do? She has no neck resistance feats like Hulk either. @atheistknowledge :  WBH would stomp WW. Wanda would blink her from existence. Mismatch How? Now I know you are trolling  @saren  it is abundantly clear that he wants a ban, he knows this is a mismatch and he continues to troll. He has made mismatch after mismatch and I think the hammer may be required..... @thenaughtytitan :  The irony of you calling in a moderator to ban a user, whom you've both trolled and falsely accused of making an intentional mismatch, is that it'll probably back fire and you'll be the one who gets banned. You've been harassing my threads and smearing my name to other users. Do you honestly believe that breaking rules (bc that's basically what you're doing every time) solely to point fingers at ppl whom you alledge to be trolls makes you any better than them? Surely you jest.. >< g>  Please  Log In  to post.     Pick a board and hit submit   Â© 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.
