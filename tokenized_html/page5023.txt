your preferred method for organizing complex notes also here s mine ðŸ’¬general dynalist forum i m curious to how people are taking notes on their dynalist not for things like journal logs or inbox management but for project wikis complex notes such as i seperate out all of those generally in how i decide how to organize things mostly i borrow experience designing catalogs in indesign to get a feel for how my data should look with custom css dynalist workflows the way i currently organize complex notes open course notes that i found effective is following narrow down a particular folder to zoom into say i m going to learning about wordpress and php merge those folders if necessary or put them next to each other or just focus on one particular list view pick a preexisting outline or make one up as i go i start small and expand this out as i go and merge unmerge notes all the time depending on what feels right ideally when i outline the outline should follow a rigid set of rules and formatting that don t change too much overtime if you had to develop a wordpress site think about what things a developer would face and what notes would need to be referenced for me its this âœª wordpress wp blog blogging foldername with lots of ctrl+f ref âœªâœª how-to-guides ftp how to install how to modify plugins local dev environment etc âœªâœª wordpress themes selection matrix to compare different themes âœªâœª wordpress plugins âœªâœª manuals video courses âœªâœª tools e.g wordpress theme detector seo with moz wamp server etc âœªâœª outlines outlining the entirety of the content management system cms of wordpress to understand it more etc ideally there should be as few top-level parent bulletpoints in this designated view as possible in my opinion things not used should be collapsed things needed at the time uncollapsed notes spanning across several folders need to be inter-linked course notes in particular how nested structures should work over time i think by default you should have as few deep level bulletpoints as possible and this should be reserved as you become more and more comfortable with notetaking as you take more and more notes deep level notes should be hidden from view and summarized into one line like a lot of times i can not find resources to do something in particular so i just write up my own method for instance i needed a method for largely scaling in-house photography image assets post processing airtable staging for collaboration redownload the assets so i can immediately rename them all in one go but it was really complicated and involved many steps so i didn t know how to do it off hand first i outline all the software tools i might possibly need in no particular order i didn t pigeon hole myself in any particular software but rather by what the software actually did instead since i didn t know which ones would work best next as i got comfortable with understanding all the tools and resources that i thought i need i would select the best tool in each category after testing each of them then i made an image outline optional in sharex to confirm that i really did understand it then i proceed to condense all my notes into as few lines as possible this is what i reference for later this is important to make note of at the very end because then i can automate everything later with excelvba scripts more macros if i wanted too i know this was a bad example but it was the one i was currently working on a complex problem similar to this would be detailing how to produce a high-quality special effects loaded short film when you ve never done film development before had no camera equipment asides a phone and had to start a film team from scratch with no help but youtube and online resources when i take notes from an open course software thats like 6 hours long done through a span of 2 weeks sometimes when i watch a video i start going that sounds like xyz i did before maybe i should look into it and then i go on a tangent with my notes its sort of like when you go on a wikipedia page searching for how bitcoin works 5 hours later you went down a wikipedia rabbit hole and are reading about what species flower is growing outside your house that s just generally how i think though i can not adhere to a hard schedule that well i find that the following workflow works for me use their outline lynda.com is a good place for me to learn things since its highly condensed information normally what i do is learn a subject here to get up and running then go straight to development manuals documents later like for instance i learned excelvba here this is how i outlined it in dynalist âœª introduction âœªâœª welcome âœªâœª using exercise files âœª 1 introducing visual basic for applications âœªâœª introducing object-oriented programming âœªâœª â€¦adding code to a recorded macro âœª 2 defining variables constants and calculations âœªâœª introducing excel vba data types âœªâœª â€¦continued write as many notes to understand topic when i take notes on something i don t understand i usually have to rewind the video sometimes to catch something what s important here is that i capture everything relevant so i can understand the topic a bit more there s a lot of debate on what the most effective method on taking notes from online videos like these some recommend going through videos several times throughout the week but i m a firm believer in just watching a video once take lots of notes â†’ condense notes later consequently if i offshoot my notes and go on a tangent here related to course notes i just make a note of new bulletpoint here and proceed from there condense notes in your own words after finishing a course over 2 weeks i like to try and summarize these notes in my own terms from my perspective its like making a condensed cheat sheet before an exam if you took a class and looked at other people s cheat sheets besides your own and how they are organized given that its all the same information for the test they all look different for each student everyone has a different set of experiences and different mnemonics for memorizing and learning information some use flashcards anki others do not some write things by hand others type same thing consequently this is how i view taking online course notes in general i recondense all the information back in my own terminology as many times as i need to understand it with my own projects if needed kind of like in the first example about how i staged image assets etc so how do you guys organize notes that are complex in nature using dynalist other tools etc my methods i create semantic dictionaries for learning languages for example in ancient greek the first bullets are sensations people virtues motions etc the second bullets are more specific in sensations they are courage vision hearing fear etc in the third level more specific in courage we see now definitions and in the fourth level we can see now derivations from these basic definitions basically i group them in few bullets as possible then first level bullets are big thematics second level bullets are more detailed subjects third level bullets even more detailed subjects fourth level bullets contain information and so onâ€¦ when writing a courseâ€¦its identical courses first bullets list of group of courses second bullets list of similar courses third bullets start process development etc etc subheaders of a course fourth bullets detailed info about the subheader of the course fifth bullets detailed info about a certain bullet or a sub-list for a bullet sixth bullets more detailed info p.s i see your notes hahaha they seem very complex first bullets topics second bullets subheaders third bullets more sub-subheaders fourth bullets fifth sixth seventh bullets info p.s i see your notes hahaha they seem very complex i think my notes are a tad too complex sometimes too i should probably tone it down a little bit when i took course notes i was creating a 1:1 relationship of notes using annotated images etc now i am finding i am barely referencing those notes because i made way too many image links also i find that i don t need as many sprint notes either and just need more project wikis also i see what your doing with the dictionaries for learning a new language it makes sense what you are doing how do you track progress when it comes to verbal communication in learning a new language edit i think i will also be using less annotated image urls overall .maybe 1 for every 10 bulletpoints i make well i dont track progress at all although it sounds useful i think i could implement that in general i would normally splurge with whatever order comes to mind first then completely remake the thing with a bit more thought later i find it easier to remake generally e.g with two tabs side by side than impose order on a big mess i ve created fairly complex systems in dynalist like crm s overlapping checklist and knowledge systems project management etc and it comes down to a choice of tag i have some knowledge systems which are pure tag based or nested bullets or more often some combination of both â€¦ i usually start by thinking about the system like a set of venn diagrams â€¦ any variable such don t overlap can be separate lists any variables which overlap becomes tags after that i just try to think what will provide the fastest way of retrieving the information i want and even test the system for this if something s too slow to access maybe i add another tag or a tag cloud at the top or a link cloud or a shortcut etc â€¦ i think you can go in with some general organisation idea but there is always some organic process for me too yes i make a long lists looong lists with each item tagged accordingly â€” this is more needed when each item needs to be in many places at once you can introduce new items in the beginning and the search will do the rest b or semantic fields without tags â€”this is for more like an organized archive or collectionâ€¦ the disadvantage is each item needs to be carefully organized in the tree i find it interesting how you both rely on tags a lot i actually almost entirely navigate by bulletpoints now and rarely use tags in general now adays rather i m learning to collapse uncollapse bulletpoints more often the only time i tag something is if it belongs in two folders but linking documents is also an option too i could understand learning a language like leonardo_muzkiz_ramo case in tagging that makes sense since learning a language mostly comes from yourself also i can see your point stephen_dewitt when it comes to crm based tag navigation each tag one client that makes perfect sense but i rarely ever put client based notes in dynalist as i don t get a roi on it imo the problem with tags in general i find is that its an extra step to navigate i guess the best example of tagging that i m used to in is evernote of the hundreds of tags i use i only shortcutted and remembered used like 5 i think i am intentionally using less tags because i keep them reserved in the event that i need them for more complex notes when interlinking and nested bulletpoints don t suffice e.g if an item belongs in two bulletpoint folders the tags i do use are the following blogposts â†’ whenever i
