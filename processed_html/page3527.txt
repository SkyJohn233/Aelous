Swift: How to reload new content (eg. array) every time the tableview appears? - Stack Overflow                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 I am having a tab bar with two views: Then I am having an array, which will be updated from the view controller with new content (eg. just append new strings).  This array populates the table view.Now when the app starts the table view shows all the arrays content, but when I move via the tab bar to the view controller, add content to the array and move back via tab bar to the tableview, I am not able to update the tableview so that it pulls the new content from the array. I tried to use  tableview.reloadData()  in both  viewDidAppear  and  viewDidLoad , but the tableview doesn't reload and still shows the data it has initially loaded at the app start, but not the new content. This is how I populate the tableview: Your  reloadData()  call is before updating array. It should be after updating the datasource: Anyways, you can make use of the  didSet  property observer of your datasource object. and then you can do: This way, anytime you change the array, your  tableView  will reload.
