turning tips into memories curious what is on at the v a museum of childhood next year the dolls house is coming to life in the new exhibition 'small stories by cw contributor on 26/8/2014 these little dwellings have so many stories to tell – not just about toys and childhood but architecture family structures domestic life and how people have lived throughout the ages there is also an incredible variety from country mansions georgian town houses and high-rise flats to a multi-coloured kaleidoscope house filled with designer furniture and artwork one suburban council house shows a family with tiny gas masks poised for an air-raid in the thick of world war two while beside an adjacent modern country house an outdoor swimming pool would be enticing if only it were n't so small inhabitants lodgers servants and guests have been brought to life through recordings as you explore the dolls houses they talk you through the challenges of rationing the rising status of women through the georgian era the challenges of living in an industrial city and the introduction of electric lamps in london their stories are playful and fascinating imaginative and perfectly in keeping with the role of the doll s house as a domestic teaching aid a place for play and escape and a record of lifestyles the stories of those who owned the houses are just as colourful too there s something a little bit unnerving about the obsessive detail that goes into the creation of each doll 's house which in this case only adds to their gravitational pull small stories has lovingly restored these details giving us more to see than you might think royal institution talks 2019 click for more visual arts recommendations the v a 's lesser known museum of childhood in bethnal green
