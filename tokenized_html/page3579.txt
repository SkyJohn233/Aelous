can you legally publish someone x27 s number plate in qld brisbane can a member of the public take photos of number plates parked on road areas and publish/transmit them fb email etc i have found this reference useful in the past when decided what i could and couldn x27 t photograph while out and about street photographer s rights not that i x27 d want to argue about it yes officer sorry officer just as you say officer i x27 m moving now officer but it x27 s useful to have some idea of when you x27 re probably in the right is there a reason you want to do that i mean people do that for personalised plates that are amusing or for people who do shitty parking jobs but i feel like if you are trying to incite something bad then they x27 ll get the cops on you someone at work is taking photos of badly/illegally parked cars and someone else is having a sookie la la about it if the person taking the photo is on public land then it is all good as the expectation of privacy is gone when you are out in public that is the gist of the law yes but don x27 t be a dick number plates are on public display if it x27 s in a public area not in their driveway then go for it probably ask the police i see them posted all the time on the x27 brisbane x27 s worst drivers x27 type of facebook groups depends on the use i guess i posted some funny ones a few days ago same as a few others .when it x27 s for a laugh it x27 s one thing but to single people out and victimize thats when it x27 d be noticed so if this link is correct how did those people who were having sex in their office building get photographed published and ultimately fired surely the photographer could be prosecuted in saying that if a paper were offered that picture would they claim it was from an unknown source and therefore not liable for prosecution parked in a public area there is no expectation of privacy so can be photographed unless you have access to department of transport records you can x27 t use the license plate number for anything so as long as the person posting them publicly doesn x27 t include any personal information i don x27 t see any harm. br could possibly be considered harassment if you identify their workplace or other people identify them on facebook or the intent of posting the pictures on the facebook page is for others to harass them i swear you must work where i work because there x27 s been an influx of emails of badly/illegally parked cars i just witnessed abuse of a bus driver the sort they are showing in the ads i was waiting in west end for the glider there were 5 others in the queue the bus arrives and a guy runs up to the front of the queue and pushes his way in first he then asks for a ticket to the valley only to be told it x27 s a prepaid service the guy gets agro and insists on a paper ticket because he forgot his go card driver again explains it x27 s a prepaid service and he can x27 t issue paper tickets the guy starts going off calling the driver uncooperative and to stop being an arsehole then a lovely lady probably in her 70s stands up and tells the guy in the sweetest possible voice excuse me we x27 d all like you to stop being an arsehole he turns barnaby joyce beetroot red and storms off its taken its time but finally it rains the gutters are overflowing and my downpipes are falling from their position this is the early christmas present that i wanted thank you rain jesus 90.2k bin chickens 590 swooping magpies mar 13 2009 cake day
