I visited your McDonalds at donnington in telford were I went for food whilst I was there I used the gents toilet they absolutely stink of what I would call bad drainage I told the manager on site to be told so what do you want me to do I felt really sick on way home  I would also like to say this matter should be resolved before anyone else complains I didn’t even get a sorry I spend nearly 25 pounds in your store not good My wife and I frequently buy drive-through veggie burger meals from McDonald’s in Holyhead. We have until recently really enjoyed them. The staff are efficient and unfailingly friendly, which has added to our pleasure. However, we have been very disappointed the last few times we have visited. What used to be a very tasty,  juicy burger with generous lashings of lettuce and other fresh ingredients and sauces has become quite unpleasant. Yesterday we found that the burgers were only edible if washed down with coffee. There was very little lettuce on them, and no more than half a teaspoon of mayonnaise. And that’s it –nothing else apart from the burger. Unless these veggie burgers are restored to their former generous fillings and deliciousness, it will be Burger King for us from now on. Which will be a pity for both us and McDonald’s. Your email address will not be published.
