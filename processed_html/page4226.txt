Schmidt ' s Sausage Shop - Steelton, PA | Groupon 378 South 7th Street, Steelton, PA 17113 +17179390501 Website Previous 1 - 10  of 201 tips Next Using an original recipe, Henry Schmidt shaped ground meat and all-natural spices into Schmidt's Sausage Shop's first German-Hungarian links. That was back in 1961; today, his grandsons Doug and Don still depend on Henry's methods to create the shop's namesake delicacy.  In addition to kielbasas and bratwursts made with local meat, Doug and Don imbue some links with cherry and hardwood flavors in an on-site smokehouse. Besides classic brats, Schmidt's stocks dry-cured sausage and bacon, as well as sauerkraut made with hand-shredded Lancaster cabbage barrel-cured for four to six weeks. Schmidt's also rolls out seasonal products such as pigs in a blanket for fall, as well as a summer variation: pigs in a beach towel.
