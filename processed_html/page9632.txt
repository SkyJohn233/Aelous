Mqtt dynamic subscriptions - Google Groups Currently just reference a global variable to do it. But if I could do it direct via mqtt it would be better. Any ideas. Currently just reference a global variable to do it. But if I could do it direct via mqtt it would be better. Any ideas. I think I might leave it as a global car Can you give me an example of the simplest flow. For pulling data on manual refresh So to reduce overhead I moved GET to poll the variable. But now that means I ' m storing hundreds of variables. I have 60 lights so instead of 60 variables I combined them in one and just did JSON Path to find the right one. I think I might have to do that for my other devices. Thanks
