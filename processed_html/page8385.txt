It is a two story library with two levels of windows and a  slightly raised roof, which provides extra space for the domed ceiling. This library has rich palette of golds, pinks and blues. Every surface is covered in decoration. The columns and statues are made out of wood, but they are painted to look like marble. The width of library was not proportionate to the height, so the architects made the galleries wider to make the room look balanced. Columns were used to support the galleries. The library holds over 15,000 books. The statues are of the Christian virtues (Obedience, Solitude, Piety, and Devotion) and disciplines (Philosophy, History, Law, and Theology). The books are placed by the corresponding statues. This is a grand stage set for displaying books. The library also contains secret doors to private rooms.
