Essentially from the moment that he joined the Boston Celtics as a rookie out of Kentucky, the point guard has been reeling off one eccentricity after another. Though it seemed like his career might be over after a failed stint with the Dallas Mavericks in the 2014-15 season, Rondo really turned the narrative around this past season, though, as he showed a ton of promise and a bit of rejuvenation for the Sacramento Kings. Obviously age has robbed Rondo to a large degree at least of what was once one of his biggest strengths in regards to his defense. While a younger Rondo was a pest on the perimeter that could create steals seemingly at will, he s not the same athlete or player that s able to make those plays anymore. However, he s still a player that can create and facilitate better than most and he showed more willingness to score in Sacramento than he had in recent years. As far as the Lakers go, though, this is a firm stay-away for them. Not only do they already have D Angelo Russel on the roster and don t need any players coming in to further complicate things, but Rondo is also the type of enigma that they don t need as they try to establish a positive culture in a post-Kobe era. If I m the Lakers, Rondo s not even getting a call even with the resurgence he had this past season.

With superstars and high draft picks coming into the league year by year, that s just how things work. However, 2016 NBA free agency is a bit more curious than normal given everything around it. < \/p>\n Not only are there some massive names that are either for sure or could possibly be hitting the open market this offseason, but there are also going to be a ton of teams that have an enormous amount of cap space as the salary cap is set to spike as the new TV deal with the league kicks in. That s going to leave plenty of teams with the room to try and sign some of these big-name NBA free agents that will be available. < \/p>\n One team that s going to have that flexibility is going to be the Los Angeles Lakers and it certainly comes at an interesting time. Not only are the Lakers rebuilding in a major way around their young players that they ve drafted over the past few years, but they are also moving into a post-Kobe Bryant era and doing so with over $60 million in room underneath the salary cap this summer. < \/p>\n With the Lakers having those types of moves to make and the ability to really make some noise in free agency, it s important to assess everything that s out there and see how the Lakers factor in.
