/ic/ - Artwork/Critique Maintenance is complete! We got more disk space. What do you guys think of Guangjian Huang ? I ' ve been practicing from some of his tutorials > > OP Like this one 1/5 > > OP He ' s got good skills ,  but bad taste. He ' s too interested in overly complex designs and overdetailing things uniformly. As a result a lot of his images don ' t read as well as they could or suffer bad composition. > > 2077074 > > 2077074 > > 2077076 He does sometimes over complicate paintings ,  but I think he kept a good balance in the zodiac series. I quite like the texture from the details ,  I dont find it overdetailing. > > 2077081 asian beauty standards I like less noisy designs > > 2077085 > > 2077088 fuck off > > 2077076 do you think the general public care? > > 2077096 Do you care about the general public? > > 2077096 No ,  but he asked me what I think ,  so I gave my opinion. Am I not allowed to have an opinion that goes against the uneducated public? Grab the average person on the street and ask them about art and they can ' t tell you jack shit. Who cares what they think. > > OP Don ' t like his work so much. He is obviously incredibly skilled but to me personally his work seems laboured and overworked. There is no eloquence. No tasteful withholding of information. No gently embedded abstractish elements. Love him ,  but i seriously prefer the 1/5 picture of this tutorial over the final. > > 2077100 why did you answer that as if my question had implied anger? im on your side on with the opinion you gave. > > OP Is it me or his style is really similar to Ruan Jia ' s ? I wonder why did they go to the same school or something ? > > 2077121 not necessarily ,  ruan jias work has better use of greys and lighting > > 2077121 > > 2077122 and ruan jias brush work is amazing. cant forget that > > 2077107 You make a good point ,  I wonder if he has any  " statement "  pieces- Atleast something that has an underlying theme > > 2077121 Holy shit they do ,  I hadn ' t noticed that. It might be ,  or maybe its just an adaption on general chinese style > > 2077121 You mean the Chinese commercial style? > > 2077121 > > 2077122 > > 2077124 > > 2077128 > > 2077130 Ruan Jia taught Guangjian Huang ,  he was one of his students > > 2077140 Source? I always just assumed HGJ ripped off Ruanjia ' s style. > > 2077094 Buttmadmuch? > > 2077144 A real life asian told me irl. Hold on ,  I ' ll google it and see if I find anything in english. > > 2077140 > Ruan will never teach you Fuck. > > 2077148 > Hold on ,  I ' ll google it and see if I find anything in english. Hah. > > 2077140 > > 2077130  ain ' t Huang ,  it ' s Yu Dehong. He may have went to the same school ,  though. Regardless ,  a lot of Chinese painters have that same vibe (strong rendering ,  generally low saturation overall ,  orange hard/soft light for things like highlights ,  bounce lights ,  etc.) > > 2077140 > > 2077144 > > 2077148 AND THE TRUTH IS REVEALED Does Ruan Jia do any tutorials or process pics/vids though? While GJH is just the aprrentice ,  atleast he shares his techniques > > 2077076 > overly complex designs and overdetailing things uniformly The definition of illustration targeted at older teens and young adults. > > 2077156 > > 2077157 Yeah ,  I couldn ' t find anything except he want to a chinese art academy in Hangzhou. I don ' t know if Ruan Jia taught at any ,  prolly. Does anyone know about the sina blog thing? It seems like it might be even better than Conceptart.org even during it ' s prime. > > 2077162 Woops ,  yes there ' s actually quite a few ,  just google/youtube search. I don ' t think any are translated or subbed ,  and they ' re basically just 2 hour long process videos. > > 2077157 > > 2077162 > Does anyone know about the sina blog thing? It seems like it might be even better than Conceptart.org even during it ' s prime. It ' s just a blog platform. That ' s like saying , " have you heard of blogspot? It seems good! "  Like yeah ,  but it ' s totally different than a forum. Apples and oranges bro. > > 2077165 > > 2077157 Here ' s three from just googlin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ltqbRywpCk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzQdZQBAOyk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZcbePO3v_A > > OP It ' s good but I can ' t help but think he ' s a show off. His painting has everything. There ' s human ,  horse ,  monster and bird anatomy check. metal ,  fur ,  flesh and stone surfaces. check. forced perspective and complex architecture. check. particle effects and dramatic lighting. check. All he needs now is landscape scenery and foliage and he ' ll have the perfect portfolio piece. > > 2077157 Stop taking random shit someone on /ic/ says as truth you gullible fool.  Ruanjia never taught HGJart ,  the guy has been around since forever. If you look at their galleries on their websites ,  they both have work up that ' s going back as far as 2005. Both of them always had a quite similar skill level. They were pretty shitty during that time and they both started getting decent at around 2008 and really good at around 2010.  There was never a time where Ruanjia was great and HGJart was shit and in a position to be taught anything by Ruanjia. > > 2077183 sources you shithead > > 2077183 Interesting. I would consider Ruanjia to be 10 times better than HGJart though ,  at this present moment. > > 2077209 Well he is number 3 in the world... > > 2077241 based on what > > 2077243 /ic/ power rankings of course > > 2077245 Holy crap why the fuck don ' t we have these??? > > 2077245 whos first? is it craig? > > 2077266 No photobashers allowed sorry. > > 2077192 Their respective websites you fucking braindead retard. Are you literally too stupid to type  " hgjart "  and  " ruanjia art "  into google and look at their fucking galleries? > > 2077270 i did faggot ,  they had no dates. > > 2077269 who then > > 2077284 top3 Maciej Jaime Dave Rapoza?  Third is personal subjective choice for me ,  other anons probably have someone else for third place. > > 2077280 lol > > 2077183 Is pretty spot on. A lot of the bad ass Chinese dudes came up together similarly the CA.org/massive black guys did ,  just a lot earlier and better trained. > > 2077284 Easily Craig ,  imo. > > 2077293 none of these are better than ruan jia ,  ahaha > > 2077284 Official current rankings: 1) Mullins 2) Jaime 3) Ruanjia 4) Peleng 5) Min Yum > > 2077308 Kek ,  only Jaime and Craig are in top 5  > > 2077293 Pretty much. But some if /ic/ get a hard on when looking at overrendered asian shit ,  so probably shitstorm incoming. > > 2077293 Maciej??? Lol maciej can ' t even draw a fucking stick figure. The guy is a concept artist. Not an artist ,  AT ALL. > > 2077315 Ruan is top 3. It goes like this: 1. Mullins 2. Jaime or Ruan 3. Jaime or Ruan 4. ....who gives a shit > > 2077308 thank you ,  thoes rankings are what i expected them to be > > 2077333 > > 2077308 If you aint first ,  you ' re last. btw  > > 2077333 Nice trips " rankings "  ahahah you guys are crazy Like /ic/ opinions mean anything. They can ' t even draw well themselves > > 2077330 Yeah he totally cant bro.  > kek at anons thinking one of the worlds top artists cant draw a figure > > 2077878 > " he can draw I tell you! " > posts prime photobashed material Let me guess ,  you ' re Polish aren ' t you? > > 2077878 Photobash. > > 2077881 > > 2077882 Amateurs like you guys will never make it when you come up with excuses like that why Maciej is so much better at painting than you. Get back to your studies and one day you might be able to paint like that ,  stop being so jelly. > > 2077878 Lol at that twist of her body > > 2077892 Looks normal ,  hater. > > 2077892 Go back to your Loomis ,  nothing wrong with the anatomy in that painting. > > 2077891 What excuses? They were merely addressing the irony in this post  > > 2077878 Which is pretty hilarious. > > 2077891 Even if that wasn ' t a photobash but a painting ,  it ' d be ridiculously bad compared to a Ruanjia painting. Which was the original point of the argument ,  that some delusional troll (you?) said Maciej would be top 3 digital artists ,  before Mullins or Ruanjia. > > 2077906 But Maciej is. Ruan Ja ,  or whatever his name is ,  doesnt even come close to this level. > > 2077878 > le polish photobash faec man face > > 2077908 pls be trollan > > 2078111 > :^D > > OP Same as all that other Chinese fantasy crap. Over-textured and generic. Bullshit ,  Ruan Jia is #1. I think /ic/ is just racist. > > 2079638 This made me think... like... if you are Ruanjia tier. And let ' s assume the guy is late twenties... where can he go now? I mean how would he get even better? To us it probably looks like he has maxed out all possible art skills... but I ' m sure a guy at that level will still find holes to patch and issues to adress.  Or maybe he will jus become faster and increasingly efficient ,  eventually capable to bust out 1 of his paintings per day. Holy shit. > > 2079677 Ruan Jia is 32. > > 2079684 And Huang Guangjian is 34 by the way. > > 2078137 > Over-textured and generic like every other west concept artist > > 2079677 ars longa ,  vita brevis there is always room to improve > > 2079677 Most people plateau eventually. Either from not being able to still experiment and improve (becoming complacent) ,  or they simply plateau due to the nature of how earning curves are shaped so progress eventually slows to basically a standstill. Anyways ,  if you look historically at people who became insane talents very young ,  then you will see they usually loosen up a bit with time and also their style changes a bit. Things feel a bit less forced or laboured and they make everything look very  " easy " . See: Sargent ,  Zorn ,  Leyendecker ,  Rembrandt ,  Sorolla ,  Van Dyck etc. It ' s also common for illustrators who become super good to eventually just switch to fine arts...see: Phil Hale ,  Howard Terpning ,  Morgan Weistling etc > > 2079721 Bernini was a child prodigy and he became even better as he got older. Shame Caravaggio died early on. It would be interesting to see how his paintings would ' ve changed. Also think Turner counts as an artist who get more loose in his works. If you guys join the Chinese social site Weibo ,  you can get a shit load of RuanJia tutorials. They ' re not easy to follow since they ' re Chinese ,  but he posts them pretty often on his page.  http://www.weibo.com/ruanjiacg1?from=myfollow_all > > 2077330 > The guy is a concept artist. Not an artist > > 2077284 sakimichan kr0n Crag Mullins > > 2082304 Kuvshinov and Sakimi in the same sentence as Mullins.. > > 2082329 Indeed ,  they make the good art that appeals to people > > 2082333 how do you guys tell if something is photobashed or not? > > 2082360 We ' ve worked with photoshop since we can remember so we can tell by the pixels > > OP Jesus Christ ,  this guy look so freaking hot ,  but can ' t put my finger on what it is. Maybe eyes? Maybe the androgenity? Maybe the long hair? > > 2083554 are you a grill? > > 2079677 > > 2079638 What ' s all the fuzz with him? Checked his 22 deviations dA and I don ' t see him standing on a whole different tier than the freelancing chinese blob you see everywhere > > 2083575 Start saving up for that eye laser surgery brah. > > 2082360 Generally speaking the image will look  " choppy "  as if one part of it is stylistically different from the rest of the image. There was a picture of a magic the gathering card photobashed with yolandis face and you could tell her naturally sharp features clashed with the softer ones the artist had painted onto the image. Also some people can very easily recognize common or their favorite images. > > 2083575 Exquisite brush technique is kind of a thing here. Most people don ' t care how masterful his strokes are at high resolution. > > 2083554 probably the fact he probably has a massive horse cock hidden from the viewer
