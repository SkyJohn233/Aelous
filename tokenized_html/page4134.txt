will the nzxt kraken x62 last a long time buildapc i was planning a pc build and was wondering how long the nzxt kraken x62 would last before either breaking or running out of fluid i wont last you as long as something like a dh-d15 obviously but it should give you no issues for 3-6 years if your lucky is there anything that is similar in performance to the dh-d15 but in a black and red color scheme apple x27 s and oranges kind of unfair comparing aio cooler to a air cooler that consists of piece of metal and only moving parts are two detachable fans aios look cool but depending on your cpu and your overclocking plans personally i would put that 150 into your gpu unless your budget already includes a 1080ti i think a lot of this depends on how much your computer is on i for one turn my pc off when i x27 m not using it which greatly increases the lifespan of moving parts like pumps and fans no need to run a computer all the time with an ssd in it when boot up is so fast i normally turn my computer off as well when i don t use it so does that mean i should get the aio cooler hi everyone my son has been asking for a gaming pc his very first one months ago i told him that he x27 ll have to earn it by working hard at school nothing x27 s free right well he did and got excellent results way beyond my expectations xmas 2019 is coming so he asked for it again problem i couldn x27 t save enough money for him and told him to give me some time and maybe he will get it for his birthday on april 2020 here in france pc parts cost a kidney he wasn x27 t upset at all he x27 s a good kid and he knows that we get rewarded for our daily actions we parents always do our best for our kids i didn x27 t want him to think that he worked hard in vain so i sold my entire superheroes dc comics collection figures sayonara superman and got the money for him he doesn x27 t know this that x27 s our secret i was aiming for a mid end and future proof gaming pc so that he won x27 t be frustrated for the few upcoming years kids grow up fast he x27 s already 14 and time flies fast maybe he x27 ll leave the house in 3 or 4 years to go to college i remembered being broke as a student and i just wanted him to have a decent and yet upgradable pc replacing one or two parts such as a gpu or cpu is easier than changing the whole pc isn x27 t it so i got all the parts and built in secret a mini itx pc again so that is easier to carry and store in a student dorm room some people only think as far as tomorrow i think years ahead building in that nzxt h210 case was very easy thanks to its size i went on a pink and blue theme since those are his favorite colors i decided to go red with a ryzen 3700x since he x27 s very interested in video editing and rendering and some other stuffs that might require a powerful cpu the enermax aquafusion 120 aio cools down that beast and does a better job than the prims cooler which was already decent that comes with the cpu then a rx 5700 xt should be more than enough to play on a wide qhd monitor couldn x27 t buy it yet have to save money he x27 ll play on a tv temporary the sapphire nitro plus version seems to be a good choice good temps silent and wow beautiful it fits really tight but it fits the trident z neo 3600 mhz ram are here to let the ryzen 3700x fully express itself for the os i went on a ssd m.2 corsair mp 510 500 gb should be enough to handle windows 10 and all his softwares two sandisk ssd ultra 3 d 1tb and he has plenty of room for his games and other things that i don x27 t want to know a sf 750 watts power supply from corsair to deliver some juice and help the gpu to breathe added a few enermax white case fans with beautiful rgb to highlight the components without going overkill with great power comes the gigabyte aorus x570i pro wifi that has great responsibility to support all these and to complete a 5 inch screen to monitor the pc yes he has to learn to keep an eye on the temps cpu and gpu load fan speed etc and here is sans referring to one of his favorite game character from undertale the mini itx pc in all its glory https //fr.pcpartpicker.com/b/bmlj7p christmas is coming in a few days can x27 t wait to offer him his dream pc he has no idea what is waiting for him around the corner i hadn x27 t half the chance that he has now when i was a kid keep working hard keep being nice caring about the others sharing and helping and you x27 ll be rewarded if i can see this hopefully somebody else one day will do too and again you x27 ll get rewarded and i promise you won x27 t have to hunt for happiness love you son daddy sending positive vibes to all the fathers and mothers out there and wishing the best to everyone for the end of the year and the new upcoming year a little over a year ago i build a pretty powerful computer ryzen 5 2600x at 4.05ghz oc gtx 1080 16gb of 3,600mhz ram and a 1tb m.2 ssd i x27 ve been quite happy with it and i get great performance i was planning on upgrading my monitor too but i kept putting it off because my 1080p 60hz monitor was good enough well i just recently got a 1440p 165hz g-sync monitor and it is fantastic everything looks amazing and it x27 s super smooth i definitely wish i had gotten that monitor sooner i just make sure nothing is hitting a fan and close that sucker edit2 you guys are all the best reinstalled windows 10 after sorting out the gpu drivers and everything running really good put each ram stick back in to the full 64gb and turned on xmp type 2 overclock back up to 5ghz etc and it runs perfect 250fps on destiny 2 which was the only one i tested as a benchmark to the original 15fps i was getting oh my word i x27 ve lurked on reddit for a while but never created an account or contributed but i x27 ll be sure to stick around as this was certainly useful for me and hopefully i can pay it forward in the future and for anyone in the future reading this with similar issues restart bios back to factory remove all ram apart from 1 stick remove cpu and check pins remove gpu and check pins put them back if all is well load back up and install bios update run a ddu on your gpu google program downloaded and did it all for me i chose the clean and restart version did not need to take my card out again reboot back up and check optional reinstall windows 10 this fixed it for me first pc build done and as i had heard it x27 s mandatory that you have an issue that needs to be solved almost 3am here and time to go to bed and find out who our new prime minister is in 2 hours time thanks again for being an awesome community/subreddit lots to learn here still edit to say i have not plugged the display into the mobo it is plugged into the 2080ti hey guys i x27 ve finally splashed out on what seemed like a really good 4k or at least 1440p 60fps gaming pc built it separately sourced the parts from a youtube vid and using part picker etc it runs counter-strike at 70fps average but that x27 s about it everything else is sub 50fps destiny 2 gets 15fps shogan 2 total war gets 20fps on the overworld/map screen apex legends around 20fps too i don x27 t get it getting better performance from my xbox one x the desktop experience as well is stuttery loading chrome opening steam clicking the start menu takes 3 or 4 seconds to start also went through max high medium low settings with destiny 2 and shogan as well just high medium and low with apex and frame rate did not change temps are not changing or acting differently also tried changing resolution from 4k to 1440p and then to 1080p and literally can x27 t get above 30fps so specs i9 9900k 3,6ghz 8 core have pushed this up in the uefi to 4.8ghz but results were the same as stock literally no improvement on overclock on the above fps i mentioned asus rog maximus xi hero wi-fi 64gb of corsair vengeance rgb pro 4 x 16gb ddr4-3200 i have put this into xmp samsung 970 evo plus 500gb m.2 windows 10 pro is installed here as well as some launchers and software samsung 860 evo 4tb ssd all games are installed here from steam gamepass origin etc msi geforce rtx 2080 ti 11gb gaming x trio not fussed about overclocking this but put it up slightly to see nothing changed again corsair rmx 850w 80+ gold certified psu this is plugged into an acer x27 predator i did have the screen set to the overclock 144hz but thought this may be affecting things so tried it with just the standard display setting and no overclock believe it x27 s at 4k 60hz cooling and temps i have a kraken x72 liquid cooler and 7 fans inc the 3 with the liquid cooler in an nzxt h700i case stats and temps using cpu-z hwin gpu-z and nzxt cam all read that the cpu is hitting 4800mhz there x27 s sufficient core voltage 1.250 approx cpu does not go above 45c around 30c idle and graphics card under x27 load x27 is around 60c around 40c when idle all drivers bios update latest windows updates all installed the youtube build shows gameplay of r6 siege at 240fps+ i just want stable 60fps at this point i have tried searching around and can x27 t seem to find this exact issue and at a loss of what to do now around Â£3,000 for a system that is basically struggling to output what my xbox one x can something must not be right ðŸ˜‚ p any help really appreciated was really happy i turned it on and everything worked booted up it was great but it x27 s like a potato struggling to open up the start menu hi everyone i recently finished my new build and wanted to share it with you all the specs are amd ryzen 7 3700x gigabyte x570 aorus elite msi gaming

fans are plugged in and actually exhausting don x27 t ask me how i know this edit case exhaust fans sorry for any confusion also the card is still running pretty hot but i guess that x27 s just a feature of the 5700 xt and no exhaust fans certainly wasn x27 t helping anything the voltage here is 220v and 60hz but in germany it x27 s 230v and 50hz will that be enough of a difference to stop my pc from working or cause permanent damage i have a micronics cyclone iii 600w it doesn x27 t say anything other than 220v and 60hz which is why i x27 m worried edit if anyone ends up reading this post my pc ended up not starting at all so i had to just buy a new psu hi everyone i just want to share my story first i wan na thank u all for help and knowledge i have about pc x27 s and pc building today i x27 m a gamer for over 10 years now and after i met my girlfriend i introduced her into gaming world being a student her parents bought her laptop because its easier to store and carry around

evga power supply edit i have decided to buy a new case and see how many newegg gift cards i can get hi everyone today i tried to install my new z390 motherboard into my fractal design vector rs however the pre installed io shield is not aligned correctly there is some space between the upper right corner and the standoff the io shield also doesn t seem to be outside of the case when installed that way and the whole shield seems misaligned i really wanted to install the pc today but unfortunately i attached some pictures below https //ibb.co/album/bwc55a edit thanks everyone for your help and some harsh comments who don t have a soul i really appreciate it some people said it is misaligned and the metal bins should go into the case didn t now that and couldn t find it anywhere i first had it this way and that s when i first had the problem with the space between the standoff later i thought maybe it should go outside just like a separate io shield so i did it again in the correct way and there is still some space between the standoff and the mobo as seen here can i just screw the other screws in and will it flushen out then edit 2 some other people said my io is pre installed incorrectly could this still be still the case as the issue is less since it s now installed correctly maybe i m just stupid could be edit 3 it seems to be fixed now and yes i was partly wrong.. thank you for your help really have a nice pc time you all hey there folks as the title informs i have nk video output after installing a new cpu the old cpu doesn t work either anymore i did not upgrade my bios which was required no ram reseating or cmos clearing has worked with neither cpu right now i m even stuck with just the psu cpu mobo and gpu plugged in and it still displays no signal yes i ve tried a hdmi monitor with no luck now i m back to using dp i ve asked everywhere and couldn t find a solution please help i m desperate i can hear my cpu cooler fan spinning faster then decreasing then spinning faster again edit it finally booted to bios with the old cpu i ll update now and put the ram back in as well the solution to the problem plugged everything out even the m.2 drive and ran with a single ram stick.cleared cmos via jumpers for one last time and it finally booted to bios everything working fine now 1.8m members 5.3k online apr 11 2010 cake day
