love the process based classes in addition to performances before walnut hill i was really involved with my local theater but it was only about performance here we are deeply invested in the art form the people here are wonderful and supportive and i feel as though i can be myself here read 65 reviews junior xa0 i am a soprano majoring in classical voice here at the academy and it is by far the most incredible place i have ever been and the best decision i have ever made i have had numerous opportunities here that i would not have had back home participating in opera scenes studying with professional instructors taking masterclasses from world-renowned singers taking rigorous academic courses and music theory classes learning to play the organ participating in student government quiz bowl and environmental committees and of course learning about art with like-minded peers in addition the location is absolutely beautiful and inspiring on its own there are so many opportunities for

conceptual ideas i learned more about art history new materials such as oil painting and figure drawing lachsa also provided seasonal exhibiting opportunities winter and spring show for students to show their work produced in class overall an amazing art education and experience read 166 reviews senior xa0 dash provides us with a supportive and welcoming environment that beams with creative energy unlike any other its given me so many opportunities like a 3 week all expense paid trip to nyc for a pre college program and the chance to bond with people who are passionate about the same artistic field i ve had a wonderful experience at dash but i do feel the need to caution that it is definitely a huge commitment dash requires long hours of work a genuine passion for art and an understanding that you may sacrifice your academics for art ex no advanced math classes are taught after ap calculus ab physics and ap environmental science are not offered and have to be taken online the school prepares you to pursue art in college but i m not sure if it prepares you well enough for an academic college career hence the sacrifice despite this there is no other school i would rather go to read 263 reviews senior xa0 the chicago academy for the arts has literally changed my entire life i m a senior currently enrolled in the media arts animation department and after coming to this school i not only feel prepared for college but also for a serious career in the animation industry the school gives what you need to be successful with freedom to grow into yourself there is no other class program or school like it don t get me started on the staff every single teacher i ve had has cared about each individuals students growth and success it took me a whole year to write a decent paper and once i wrote one my english teacher pulled me aside after class and personally expressed to me how impressed he was at how much i had grown from my last paper arts teachers are just as great in media arts specifically we have personal mid end of year reviews where our teachers come together and tell you where you need to improve what you re doing right since coming here my art has greatly improved read 38 reviews alum xa0 your time at a d will be short once you look back on it the school is absolutely amazing at providing students with resources and material if only the students took advantage of the opportunities in general the school s academics are alright however there are some excellent teachers at the school that go beyond just teaching in the classroom all the art teachers are brilliant and will teach you much about your major many of them either work in the field taught the course at a college level or both i would say the clubs are limited and the sports isn t a big aspect there are both good and bad kids in this school like any other it s become a bit more diverse in recent years and have been preparing kids for college better really the only downside is how the administration deals with the bathroom situation in the school read 299 reviews senior xa0 most of my experience here has been wonderful there have been a couple of teachers here and there that weren t that good at all but the majority are amazing i couldn t help but notice how invested the teachers are in the students success and have even developed some amazing bonds with some of my teachers for an arts school the academics are pretty good and of course the different art strands are also amazing it s a very free and independent environment but the faculty members give help if you seek it out counselling recommendations scholarship opportunities tutoring etc which i think is perfect when trying to get highschoolers to get used to a college environment my only problem is that certain higher up administrators have been slacking and don t treat every strand with the same respect which is totally unfair but other than that everything here is pretty nice read 285 reviews senior xa0 amazing school for the arts it isn t a typical high school if you re looking for friday night football and pep assemblies this might not be the place for you but if you re looking for a very supportive creative environment that appreciates diversity this is it and some people think because it s an arts school it doesn t have good academics it does my coursework is challenging and doesn t all revolve around my cluster i m music i ve taken lots of ap classes and think i m set up to do well in college read 444 reviews parent xa0 we have two children in the elementary school and could not be more pleased there is nothing about the school we don t like from the academics to the arts to the community oakwood takes great pride and care in making sure that everyone s needs are being met we are incredibly excited for our children to attend the secondary school as it offers both competitive academics with incredible arts and steam programs with the new athletic director we are excited to see what advances are made in that arena as well we can not recommend oakwood highly enough read 31 reviews alum xa0 what i liked about new roads school while enrolled was pretty much everything this school takes a holistic approach to preparing its students for the rigors of a higher education as well as making a difference in society the faculty staff and administrators who truly became our friends and mentors created a one-of-kind learning environment where i felt challenged motivated and encouraged to do my best the enrichment trips i got to go on each year i attended the upper school regardless of me and my family x2019 s financial need have had such positive effects on me x2014 i still remember those trips fondly to this day i could go on and on about new roads school read 106 reviews alum xa0 at crossroads school students thrive as learners artists and people rigorous coursework paired with high level discussions of society s major problems push students to become active global citizens dedicated to making a change in the world the teachers commitment to the students is unparalleled the learning style often asks students to connect curriculum and their own lives

passions in a safe warm environment all while applying their newfound knowledge to real world problems crossroads students prove that even high schoolers can make a difference read 44 reviews senior xa0 more than just a school above all a home fourteen floors of chaotically creative people students teachers and faculty alike from the age of six i was taught to constantly question and challenge everything that play rehearsals were more important than that physics test i have learned to self motivate without competing with classmates and to treat every essay i write with the respect and eloquence of a novel i have made puppets written a twenty-page paper on the history of martial arts and hypothesized whether sweet flavors are more commonly synesthetically assigned to major chords keep in mind that this environment in addition to being incredibly fruitful both creatively and academically it can be perceived as a rose-colored six-foot thick bubble protecting its students from harsh realities beyond its walls in my last year i have come to see saint ann s for all of its flaws and strengths thank you read 33 reviews senior xa0 the high school for the performing and visual arts also known as hspva is best known for its involvement in arts in general but much more lies beneath this school x2019 s surface the school x2019 s academics are amazing trumping many other schools year after year their main goal is to get students into the great colleges they want to the student community is very diverse and welcoming and there is a tremendous amount of culture within the walls of the old school there are over forty clubs- which is quite a lot considering the school x2019 s roughly 700 students more clubs are added and replaced every year- if you don x2019 t see anything you like one year wait until the next one or better yet start your own i absolutely love this school it s a huge community the teachers and the administration r all extremely student-friendly that actually care about us the academics is hard but teachers really want to help you read 239 reviews senior xa0 my main concerns of the school is the building we ve had multiple flooding due to poor piping that s more than 30 years old the heating and cooling systems in the building are also not the best the room temperatures of each room can differ drastically my gov class is usually pretty cold that i need to wear a thick sweater while my english class is where i sweat off my calories from the school breakfast in addition school lunch really isn t the best the portions of the lunch given is not equal one kid getting chicken nuggets fries and greens is not equal to another child being given only 3 chicken nuggets due to a short of supplies we have escalators that barely work lastly i am against smoking in the bathrooms there have been 2 occasions where i personally smelt the gross fumes of the smoke and i ve witnessed many times vaping in the bathrooms read 993 reviews alum xa0 i went to csw back in the 1970 s my mother s idea because i was on the verge of dropping out of school i just wanted to be an artist and saw no reason to go any farther but after a year at

good people read 17 reviews alum xa0 i had a wonderful experience with the governor x2019 s school i was a student for one summer and three years and learned so much about myself as an artist a scholar and an independent individual the residential element is an element that sets this school above the rest by bringing artist from all over sc together to truly embrace their creativity without a cent in tuition for me it was a hard adjustment as a sophomore to move into a dorm an hour and a half away from home after just turning 15 but my peers and the staff helped with this transition and made my time at governor x2019 s school a phenomenal experience read 71 reviews senior xa0 i came in 9th grade and after a few months i found my group the theatre department is fantastic the faculty and my teachers have been immensely supportive and hands on with an issue i ve been having for years with a really extraordinary focus on my well-being compared to maybe how other schools would handle it when i first got to wildwood i was surprised by the lack of cliques and hierarchy found in other schools including my previous one though not perfect i m grateful that to go here i think it s the best fit for me read 36 reviews junior xa0 i have throughly enjoyed my experience at oakland school for the arts the faculty is extremely friendly and outgoing and the arts programs are incredible i have been at this school since 6th grade and i would highly reccomend it to any prospective sstudents in general college prep is pretty ok if you are looking to pursue your art as a career or at least in college you will be well set however if you are looking to go into academic areas of study it may be a little bit harder due to the smaller number of electives nevertheless osa is a really great school and the community is amazing a lot of people are super friendly and it is easy to make friends and create support systems the academic support and wellness counseling/therapy resources are also a big plus and if you end up here expect to have help whenever it is needed i hope this helps to influence your decisions trust me osa is not an opportunity you want to miss out on hope to see you on campus read 126 reviews sophomore xa0 excellent with great teachers it needs more improvement regarding clubs and extracurricular otherwise it is amazing read 43 reviews junior xa0 this school holds

create an enviromrnt that is easy for all types of students to learn they cater to everyone x2019 s needs more than any other school i x2019 ve been at another nice feature of perpich is the amount of materials that you have access to if you were living on your own and paying for your own art supplies you would be paying thousands of dollars for the amount of technology and materials that are available at this school making these materials free to their student body has helped so many kickoff their career in arts every week this school brings in speakers that have usually graduated from perpich that have succeeded and it provides inspiration every week to keep learning and to keep pursuing our individual art areas read 132 reviews parent xa0 i have 2 children currently attending hillbrook they look forward to going to school each day and are both thriving academically there is an emphasis on project-based interdisciplinary learning as well as collaboration all taught in an environment that encourages independent thinking this type of schooling may look different than traditional models but the proof that it has had an impact on my children is in their enthusiasm for
