Days Difference – Are You Happy Lyrics | Genius Lyrics You've got a boyfriend I ' ve got a girlfriend I keep on wondering Are you happy? Where are you tonight? Under the same sky Wish you could tell me, tell me Are you happy? Lie awake, I keep hoping That you ' d say you ' re lost and lonely I know, I know That there ' s nobody better, better You were meant for me and I was meant for you I still want to, want to If you ' ll have me, have me My door is open hoping you ' ll walk through Ah, ah are you happy? Where did you go then? No way of knowing It was so sudden Are you happy? What did I say that? I ' d take it all back Wish you could tell me, tell me Are you happy? Lie awake and I can ' t stand it Why should we make this so tragic? I know, I know That there ' s nobody better, better You were meant for me and I was meant for you I still want to, want to If you ' ll have me, have me My door is open hoping you ' ll walk through Ah, ah are you happy? Ah, ah are you happy? Ah, ah are you happy? Don ' t know what to believe in Heart stopped but I ' m still breathing I lost everything, but I ' m still holding on You ' ve got a boyfriend I ' ve got a girlfriend I keep on wondering Are you happy? I know, I know That there ' s nobody better, better You were meant for me and I was meant for you I still want to, want to If you ' ll have me, have me My door is open hoping you ' ll walk through Ah, ah are you happy? Ah, ah are you happy? Ah, ah are you happy happy happy You ' ve got a boyfriend
