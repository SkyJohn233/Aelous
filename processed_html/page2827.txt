(Photo: Bob Blanchard/Special to the Register) The Basilica of St. John at University and 19th Street is defying a trend. Its congregation, unlike most others in the Des Moines Catholic Diocese, has kept growing. Even as parishioners have left the urban core for the suburbs, others with roots in Vietnam, Africa and Central America have arrived. Opened in 1927, the ornate church is one of 60 basilicas in the country. It has a Spanish language Mass and a head priest, Father Aquinas Nichols, who once was a Benedictine monk serving at the Vatican. Today it owes much of its new growth to young families, including home-schooled children. I live a couple of miles from St. John’s and for decades I’ve driven by without knowing its story. Had it been in a foreign city where I was a tourist, I might have toured it to admire the architecture and the art or pause in a pew for a moment of solace. But most of us don’t ordinarily visit other people’s places of worship unless we are asked. We're afraid of intruding or not knowing how to behave. But just pore over the pages of a beautiful new book written, edited and researched by Drake University students, and you’ll see how welcome you would be. “A Spectrum of Faith: Religions of the World in America’s Heartland” is where I learned about St. John’s Basilica. It's where Tierney Grisolano, a sophomore double-majoring in religion and sciences, immersed herself, as all 15 students did in 15 Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, Jewish, Muslim or Sikh religious communities for 15 weeks. Their mandate wasn't to write about these faiths as objects of curiosity,  but to understand the religion as it is lived. “There is something so peaceful about the services at St. John’s,” Grisolano wrote. "... Silence as the faithful participate in sharing the body and blood of Christ.” Grisolano was raised Methodist and is now drawn to Hinduism, but that doesn't stop her from appreciating what a Catholic service offers. And that's the sort of cross-fertilization the Comparison Project, which Tim Knepper directs, is intended to inspire. Knepper teaches philosophy of religion. The project includes the book, written and researched by students, and photographed by local photographer Bob Blanchard, along with a 15-minute film by student Anna Steenson. A series of public lectures and events called the Iowa Interfaith Exchange explore different religious philosophies. Drake Community Press published the book, one in a series intended to tear down walls between college and community. Spaulding’s students researched, edited and designed the book. All proceeds go to the Des Moines Area Religious Council. FINDING HER VOICE: Order a copy of Rekha Basu's book A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.  It comes at a time when Americans, especially those 18 to 29 years old, feel more positive toward different religions, according to a February  Pew Research Center survey.  It's also a time when religion is losing its centrality in people's lives,  a 2016 Gallup poll  finds. Only 53 percent of people nationally said religion was very important to them; 75 percent said it's losing its influence on American life. Non-Christian religions  account for about 1 percent of Des Moines' population. Yet there are nine mosques in the area, and multiple Buddhist and Jewish organizations. In an introduction to the book, Eboo Patel, who heads the Chicago-based Interfaith Youth Core, likened Des Moines to “the city on a hill” referenced in Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount. “You have built something that I believe cities all over the United States and the world should seek to emulate,” he wrote. Matthew Becke, a senior majoring in Law, Politics and Society, doesn’t have a religion. But to understand the rituals practiced at Ezan, the Bosnian Islamic and Education Center, he followed the month-long, dawn-to-dusk fast for Ramadan. In the first week, he felt unusually irritable, he wrote. But with guidance from the imam, Becke powered through. “I found that by altering my outlook so that anger became not a negative emotion but a positive opportunity, I... have since found greater control over my thoughts and actions.” Meditation was Chamindi Wijesinghe’s challenge. the junior majoring in accounting was immersed in a Lao Buddhist temple, Wat Phothisomphan, or the Meditation Monastery. She appreciated that deep meditation could enable a more purposeful life, but struggled to not get distracted. Wijesinghe also claims no faith. One of the essays features Temple Beth El Jacob, the orthodox Jewish synagogue. It has a special place in my heart. For 10 years it gave out an annual community service award in the name of my late husband, Rob Borsellino, though he was not Jewish but Catholic. Greater knowledge brings greater harmony.  “If people knew more about Islam, I think there would be less prejudice,” said Carol Spaulding-Kruse, a Drake English professor. “We have not been successful until the faith communities we represented are as interested in each other as they are in themselves.” Spaulding-Kruse was born to Methodist parents who left the church. She eventually found her way to the Quakers. Knepper was raised Evangelical Christian, but learned in college to think critically about religions, and today attends Plymouth Congregational Church. “My body does Christianity, but my mind is more Buddhism or atheism,” he says. Knepper says only since the Enlightenment has religion meant “organized systems of belief that are exclusive." Maybe some day people won't be associated with one church or temple but feast on a smorgasboard of different beliefs and rituals, choosing those that speak to them. Whether or not that happens, the spirit of inquisitiveness and of inclusiveness generated by this project should inspire others to do their own exploring.
