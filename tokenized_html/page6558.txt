musescore example manager sqeezes image musescore i tried the musescore example manager and did not get the expected results i 'm using musescore 2.0.2 portable libreoffice is v 5.0.4.2 installed locally example manager 2.0.0 i import an .mscz file apply rightclick format image on the tab type i set width as required save and reopen the mscz is included as expected then i try to cut out just a part of the score rightclick format image on the tab crop i select keep scale and enter just a value into bottom to remove the lower part of the score and keep the upper part as long as the document stays open it looks as expected see attachment blackisblack_1.png now i save the file and reopen it again the imported score is still there the size is as before but it does not show the cut-out part instead there 's the whole score page squeezed to the height i have set see blackisblack_2.png is there something wrong with my workflow what 's the intended way to use example manager is there some explanation or manual how to use it i wanted to write all the score parts i need into one .mscz file import it several times and cut out the snippets that i need should i better use separate mscz files for every snippet and avoid cropping in libreoffice i 'm not quite following what you are doing in what oprogram are you trying to cut a portion of the image from libreoffice if so then whatever issue you are seeing is a lbreoffice issues the musescore example manager inserts the iage for you but once it is inserted it is done with its job anything else you do with that image is just libreoffice doing whatever it would normally do i 'm also not understand your question about how you are why you are using the example manager in the first place it almost sounds like you are trying to use libreoffice to assemble parts for your score rather than simply using file parts are you aware musescore can do that automatically the intended use for the example manager is just to be able to insert short musical examples into a text document like if you are writing a textbook so you 'd create each example as a separate score containing just that example and use the example manager to insert them into your libreoffice document reply in reply to i m not quite following what by marc sabatella thank you for your quick and helpful reply i was able to fix it the essential hint was whatever issue you are seeing is a libreoffice issues the musescore example manager inserts the image for you but once it is inserted it is done with its job msem inserts the image as a link this is the correct way to do it if i manually insert an image with the link checkbox set i get the same result as by using msem then i cut out a part of the image with libre office writer 's crop function i rightclick the image and call format image i select the crop tab and set keep scale on crop bottom 18,5 cm the crop function calculates image size height 7,22 cm which is the remaining rest of the image 's a4 size and now the difference that makes it work or not if i save as .doc and reopen the crop bottom value is lost and reset to 0 cm just image size height is kept and the image is squeezed to the height of 7,22 cm as i reported in my previous post if i save as .odt and reopen both crop bottom and image size height are kept and everything is fine reply in reply to i m not quite following what by marc sabatella why i 'm doing this i sometimes reduce scores to a one page cheat sheet containg just a few measures of written music some chords parts of lyrics lines whatever is helpful for me to memorize a song the attached examples were created with winword the score snippets are exported as graphics out of finale switching now to libreoffice and musescore i think that your example manager will be a real help especially in case the score snippets need editing thank you very much for making and providing it reply in reply to i m not quite following what by marc sabatella i have some trouble updating the inserted .png ctrl+leftclick on the picture opens musescore correctly i make a change in the .mscz close musescore and save the changes in the still open .odt file i select the image and click the msem icon musescore is opened in the background and updates the .png then the updated .png is shown but with the original size cropping and resizing is lost libre office hangs and i close the .odt discarding changes when i try reopen the .odt it it takes very very long to load reply in reply to i have some trouble updating by squeezeboxer yeah i would n't expect the re-inserted links to keep the editing you 've done it 's a new image basically the expectation is that you create the score in musescore *already* reduced to just the measures you want that 's kind of the point so you do n't *have* to do any cropping or resizing manually create the example in musescore exactly the way you want it and it gets inserted that way it handles the cropping of excess white space from the marigns so you do n't have to worry about that reply do you still have an unanswered question please log in first to post your question
