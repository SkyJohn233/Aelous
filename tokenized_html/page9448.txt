how smack makes big data faster computing this webinar will explore issues such as the extent to which data is already shared between organisations how many third-party touchpoints exist in partner chains today and how often companies have to field customer issues that are outside their direct control through expert keynotes end-user case studies and moderated panel discussions the event will cover the key issues surrounding the transition to devops pushing through agile and bringing people with you as you do computing s devops excellence awards showcases outstanding achievement from organisations personalities and solutions operating within the devops space in 2020 computing and crn will once again be hosting a festival with content that doesn t shy away from the harsh realities of being a woman within the tech industry this year will focus on empowerment development management and even the taboo of managing inappropriate workplace interactions this white paper details 7 case studies of attacks that were intercepted and neutralised by darktrace cyber defense ai including a zero-day trojan in a manufacturing company 's network learn how darktrace antigena ai response modules fight back autonomously no matter where a threat may emerge extending to the cloud email and saas this white paper explores how cloud is a security blind spot for many organisations who struggle with the limited visibility and control in this new environment where their existing security tools are often not applicable welcome to computing 's spotlight section where we focus in on particularly important themes and topics of enterprise it computing in association with workday is hosting the cloud erp channel you are currently accessing computing via your enterprise account if

there 's one thing that everyone agrees on surely it 's that the world of technology desperately needs a new acronym fortunately one has just arrived and it 's a cracker smack stands for spark mesos akka cassandra and kafka these are all open-source mostly apache software projects akka is not the term was coined by mesosphere a company that bundles these technologies together in its infinity package which was designed in collaboration with cisco to help developers solve big data and iot-type challenges where speed of response is essential such as real-time recommendation engines or fraud detection patrick mcfadin chief evangelist for apache cassandra at datastax calls these use cases fast data problems we asked him to explain more computing why no hadoop is that because schmack does n't work as well mcfadin hadoop fits in the slow data space where the size scope and completeness of the data you are looking at is more important than the speed of the response for example a data lake consisting of large amounts of stored data would fall under this hadoop just did n't have anything to offer for fast data problems so was n't added how do the technologies in the smack stack work together kafka stands as the ingestion point for data possibly on the application layer this takes data from one or more applications and streams it across to the next points in the stack akka spark and cassandra take data from kafka into the data layer cassandra handles the operational data while spark provides near real time analysis of that data mesos is tasked with orchestrating the components and managing all the resources used by each of them as a full round trip cassandra can then be used to serve data back to the application layer what are the business advantages of using the smack stack over other approaches standardising on a set of tooling reduces the problems of trying to integrate products on an individual basis if a company needs what smack can offer it would be foolish to try to reinvent the wheel over and over since many large enterprises are already using cassandra as an operational data store they already have some value from one of the components involved adding the full smack stack may shorten processing times of data analysis which can add value to a previously installed cassandra cluster however any business considering this path still needs to do the analysis of the potential roi return on investment for example some hadoop adopters have been left questioning the true roi of their projects after running for a while this is not the fault of the technology itself but whether it has been applied in the right way smack has to be looked at in the same way is this mix of technologies still at the developer phase or are enterprises looking at it for production use cases mesosphere most likely has some large customers using infinity it 's definitely beyond the hacker/developer phase at this point large-scale companies are using a variation of this stack in production as well particularly those teams that are looking at how to take their big data projects forward the likes of william hill are using a stack based on smack for example alongside this cassandra adoption in the enterprise has been on a serious uptick over the past two years and the release of v3.0 should continue this growth apache spark is beginning to attract more large software vendors to support it as it fits a different need to hadoop however i think that more of these vendors will graduate up to supporting stacks like smack in future as well as companies want to build up a complete picture of processing for their data this will become a production requirement for companies as they move from initial pilot phases into relying on big data for their revenues what are other approaches you could take to achieve a similar end alternatives would be to replace the individual components for example yarn could be used as the orchestration tool instead of mesos while apache flink would be a suitable batch and stream processing alternative instead of akka there are going to be subtle alternatives to smack the basic premise is still secure though building an end-to-end pipeline for data needs to have these types of components that can all interact in a manner that is simple to integrate and get up and running quickly rather than requiring huge amounts of effort to get the tools to play nicely with each other glossary of terms akka a toolkit and runtime aimed at simplifying the construction of concurrent and distributed applications on the java virtual machine jvm the only element that is not an apache software project cassandra a nosql database management system kafka a distributed messaging system originally developed by linkedin mesos a cluster management system co-created by matei zaharia who also co-created spark spark a general-purpose big data processing platform that generally runs in-memory
