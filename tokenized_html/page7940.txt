cheney hose clamp kit jaguar 3.8 e-type 09-8712 after years of development and painstaking research xks unlimited is pleased to introduce first-class reproductions of the ever-elusive cheney-type hose clamps every effort was made to faithfully reproduce the original cheney design in all respects including materials dimensions construction and finish these clamps were made to address the non-availability of original clamps especially for jaguar owners who seek the ultimate in authenticity these clamps are bright cadmium plated just like the originals over time this cad plating will dull and turn darker this is normal jaguar never used a bright zinc plated or stainless steel clamp the less bright cad finish is correct frankly speaking the original cheney clamps were not that great or as easy to install as modern stainless spring steel clamps some effort is required for good results these clamps were cadmium plated in the open position so that all clamp surfaces would be completely and uniformly coated therefore prior to installation you will have to close the clamps first ensure that the clamp is completely round and that the leading edge of the clamp feeds directly into the mouth of the screw mechanism this is most easily done particularly on smaller clamps by forming them over a circular template such as a section of water pipe mounted in a vice gently tap the clamps round using a soft mallet or wooden hammer handle be sure that the leading edge of the clamp is feeding into the body at the correct angle next dab a bit of white grease or similar lubricant on the leading edge of the clamp top and bottom and onto the receiving end of screw body after plating the clamps can be a bit tight and this will help ensure smooth operation finally run the clamps in and out a few times to spread the grease around wipe off the excess and install one fault of the cheney clamps is that they require a good bit of effort to tighten and since they can only be tightened with a flat-blade screwdriver the clamp may feel tight on the hose when it is not tighten the clamp as much as possible using the biggest screwdriver possible then start the car and look for leaks tightening again as necessary once the hoses warm up and become a bit softer tighten once more .prop65-cont display -webkit-box display -ms-flexbox display flex flex-direction column justify-content center align-items center .prop65-text-cont display flex flex-direction column padding 0 0 0 10px line-height 1.3 width 100 .prop65-text-cont p padding 0 margin 0 width 400px text-align left font-weight:400 font-size 12px .ca-text font-size 14px .warning-text font-size 14px font-weight bold important .more-indo-link-text font-size 14px .warning-symbol-cont width 100 warning-svg display block max-width 50px media only screen and min-width 768px .prop65-cont display -webkit-box display -ms-flexbox display flex flex-direction row .prop65-text-cont display block padding 0 0 0 10px line-height 1.3 .prop65-text-cont p padding 0 margin 0 width 400px text-align left font-weight:400 .ca-text font-size 14px .warning-text font-size 14px font-weight bold important .more-indo-link-text font-size 14px warning-svg width 50px .warning-symbol-cont width unset california residents prop 65 warning warning cancer and reproductive harm visit www.p65warnings.ca.gov
