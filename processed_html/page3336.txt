Pupils at a school were warned  " Don ' t mention the War  "  in their Christmas show . . . in case they caused offence to sensitive parents. The kids had planned to stage the famous scene from the classic comedy Fawlty Towers as one of the highlights of their programme. But it proved no laughing matter for teachers at St Thomas More school in Blaydon, Gateshead, who feared a backlash and decided to pull the plug. A source said:  " The episode - the one about the Germans and  " don ' t mention the war "  - is arguably the most well- known and funniest of an internationally-acclaimed comedy series. " To accuse it of being racist is political correctness at its worst. " After weeks of preparations, rehearsing and getting costumes and scenery, the show was all ready to go on and all the tickets had been sold. " However, two days before the start date, the deputy head decided to cancel it. " In the episode Basil Fawlty, played by John Cleese, is left alone in charge of the Torquay hotel by his wife Sybil who has gone into hospital for a minor operation. He suffers a concussion after being struck by a moose ' s head he was attempting to nail to a wall in the foyer, causing him to act even more deranged then ever. While serving some German guests in the dining room, he loudly says to staff  " Don ' t mention the war "  within earshot of the foreign visitors, who are bitterly upset. The scene ends with Basil goose-steeping in and out of the dining room before his antics are brought to an end after he is hit once again by the moose ' s head. The concert involved kids from all years in the school for 11-19 year olds. The Roman Catholic school ' s head teacher Michael Zarraga said:  " I certainly did not regard that episode of Fawlty Towers as racist. " He added:  " I personally found it very funny. " It was thought some people may take a different view and be sensitive to it and so it was pulled out of the show. " The Christmas concert is a celebration of both Christ ' s birth and the talents of the students. " It was decided that it was better not to risk being contentious. " I think there is a difference between being aware of other people ' s sensibilities and political correctness. "
