This project,  Bench-top Factory , is part of Exploring Emergent Futures, the firstplatform project of the academic year. Bench-top Factory asks first-year MA students to create their own mini-factories. Small teams,working within the confines of a bench measuring 80 x 180 cm, will follow themanufacturing process from concept to product and, in doing so, develop small-scalesystems capable of making a diverse range of products. With the Form1+ desktop 3D printer at the heart of theproject, MA students also have the invaluable opportunity to experiment with cutting-edgetechnology, exploring real-world and future-focused applications of3D-printing and, in the process, honing new skills. Bench-top Factory demonstrates the Design Products programme’s commitment to bringing in the mostinspiring external collaborators to work with MA students. Boston-based Formlabs , creators of the Form1+ desktop 3D printer, are at the forefront ofexpanding access to 3D-printing technology for artists, designers andengineers. Launched in 2012, Formlabs was founded by a team ofengineers and designers from the prestigious MIT Media Lab and Center for Bitsand Atoms, and supported by a record-breaking $3 millon Kickstarter campaign.The company expanded into Europe this summer. Speakers at  Bench-topFactory ’s launch on 20 October 2014 included Yoav Reches, Formlabs’ leadindustrial designer and an MA Design Products alumnus, continuing theprogramme’s rich tradition of graduates returning to teach at the RCA and sharewith current students their successes in industry. Other contributors were Al Dean, editor-in-chief and co-founderof  DEVELOP3D  Magazine, and JoniSteiner, co-founder of  Opendesk , a UK-based company changing how furniture ismade through its use of free and open-source software. Exploring Emergent Futures (EEF) isone of five new platforms that make up the Design Products programme. Platformleader and Senior Tutor James Tooze outlined the platform’s wider aims, ‘EEF explores and plays with tomorrow’s present, making manifestthe ideas and theories of others, as well as adding our own, throughexperimentation, prototyping, possible products and object-orientated narratives.In doing this, we aim towards socially positive products.’ Head of Programme Dr Sharon Baurley praised  Bench-top Factory ’s determinedly outward-lookingstance, ‘Ensuring that Design Products is relevant to the design industry meansestablishing strategic relationships with key external partners. Thecollaboration with Formlabs marks the start of this initiative.’ Bench-top Factory culminates in an informal exhibition for RCA staff and students on 20 November2014.
