my refrigerator door was left open for 8 hours can i still eat the food inside yahoo answers the door was only open slightly the light was off most food felt cold to the touch but the orange juice was not cold to drink it tasted more like room temp we closed the door and didn x27 t test the temperature of any of the food but all day long i x27 ve been worried about what to do i don x27 t want to waste the food and i don x27 t want anyone to get sick either what should i do i x27 ve had a similar experience in the past so i just did some checking and am copying a snippet of what i found a temperature of 40 Â°f should be maintained in the refrigerator in contrast to freezer storage perishable foods will gradually spoil in the refrigerator spoilage bacteria will make themselves known in a variety of ways the food may develop an uncharacteristic odor color and/or become sticky or slimy molds may also grow and become visible bacteria capable of causing foodborne illness either don x27 t grow or grow very slowly at refrigerator temperatures i think your fruit veggies should be fine celery and some others might go limp throw away your eggs mayonnaise or salad dressings containing it meats leftovers salsa sauce milk or cream sour cream cottage cheese other dairy or non diary alternatives cheese is fine at room temp oily salad dressings without dairy ingredients should be fine smell test works the lifespan of the rest of the fridge contents will be shortened hope that helps fridge door left open the food in the back of the refrigerator is probably fine since it was still running i would visually inspect and smell the stuff in the front of it like on the door probably throw the oj out well since refrigeration is only a retardation of the rotting/fermenting/spoiling process anything that wouldn x27 t spoil in eight hours of room temperature sould be just fine certain things should probably be cooked i.e meats and others things might be best thrown away i.e milk but beyond that the other food should still be okay i would probably throw it out i am very particular with food actually i throw away very little but am afraid to eat or feed any food to my family that might be suspect better safe than sorry good luck whatever you decide i wouldn x27 t eat anything preishable meat eggs poultry fish dairy etc as well as the likes of pasta salads mayonnaise or whatever fruits veges most sauces butter and other things should be alright as well as any chocolates dessert food etc better to be safe then sorry best of luck hi princess i would scream and go get my gun..with the high price of food i wouldn x27 t care who she was no one and i mean no one is going to steal my food from my family and get away with it besides that oprah needs to drop at least 70lbs if not more.. your friend poppy1 you should smell acouple of things like the ham or meats the food should be good still try something to eat well if its things that can get a little warm it should be fine but it its like umm meat that can rot then i wouldn x27 t eat it sorry i dont really know how warm the food was so thats the best i can do
