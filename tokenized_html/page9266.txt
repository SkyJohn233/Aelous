hydrogen-atom abstraction from alkanes by oh i. neopentane and neooctane sciencedirect sciencedirect absolute rate coefficients for reactions of the hydroxyl radical with neopentane perdeuteroneopentane and neooctane were measured with the laser photolysis/laser-induced fluorescence technique experiments were performed at 400 torr helium pressure over the temperature range 287–903 k. the data were fit to modified arrhenius expressions of the form k t =at n exp −e/rt from this study it was found that common parameters could be used to characterize the kinetics of the three reactions for the oh/neopentane system an increase in the reaction activation barrier of ≈947 cal/mole resulted upon deuterium substitution in neopentane theoretical calculations of this energy shift were performed and excellent agreement with experiment was obtained elsevier we use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads by continuing you agree to the use of cookies copyright © 2019 elsevier b.v. or its licensors or contributors sciencedirect ® is a registered trademark of elsevier b.v
