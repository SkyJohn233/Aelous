Can getBestProvider ever return null? - Stack Overflow                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 In the following code snippet: I've tried to keep the criteria as broad as possible to get any GPS location provider available at all. I need to detect the case when none are available even then.  How can this be handled? Will the getBestProvider call ever return null in such a case?  The  documentation  says that: Returns the name of the provider that best meets the given criteria.  Only providers that are permitted to be accessed by the calling  activity will be returned. If several providers meet the criteria, the  one with the best accuracy is returned. If no provider meets the  criteria, the criteria are loosened in the following sequence:      power requirement, accuracy, bearing, speed, altitude Note that the requirement  on monetary cost is not removed in this process. So it is still possible that you cant find a provider that fulfills all your requirements. In this case, null is returned. This is not in the documentation, but I can valid it from my personal experience. In order to avoid that, you can address a Provider directly, if the method getBestProvider returns null. So you have a backup.
