15 Best Solar Installation Services Near Me - HomeAdvisor If you've been considering installing solar panels to reduce your electric bills, now may be a good time to get it done. The first step is to find solar panel installers in your area.  There are many benefits to having solar energy powering your home. Besides being environmentally friendly, it's estimated that with the annual savings on energy bills and some of the government rebates, the panels can pay themselves off in about 7 years on average.  Solar panels can be used as a completely alternate power source or as a way to power a portion of your home - for example just your water heater, pool heater, or appliances and lighting.

They've walked us through our roof replacement and solar installation project step by step, and the result is beautiful. The only reason I had to take away some stars is that it took them longer than promised to get us on the schedule and the solar crew forgot to run a check at the end of installation and thus missed the fact that one of the panels was not connected. The problem was quickly remedied, though. Overall, I highly recommend them!" --5.0 star review from a homeowner in Santee CA "He came to inspect the solar panel for problem and report no problem immediately the next day.
