Updated: November 15, 2019 @ 9:04 am Former Westgate standout D’Nerius Antoine, left, signed Wednesday to play football at Southern Mississippi. With Antoine is WHS head football coach Ryan Antoine. Southern Mississippi recruited Westgate High’s D’Nerius Antoine throughout his career at Trinity Valley Community College and stuck with it when his transfer to Oklahoma State didn’t work out this year. That persistence paid off for the Golden Eagles Wednesday when Antoine signed a national letter of intent to play at USM. “I figured that was the best thing for me because it was close to home, not too far for my mom to come see and my family,” Antoine said Wednesday as he prepared to send his papers to USM from Westgate High School. Iberia Medical Center Antoine (6 feet tall, 231 pounds) expects to switch from free safety to strong safety with the Golden Eagles. He made 69 tackles, 56 of them solo, with two interceptions and eight pass breakups this past season for the Cardinals. Antoine said his strengths are “my ability to get to the ball and to be able to read everything.” A former two-way star for Westgate’s Tigers, Antoine said having played offense, and two years of college experience at safety, will help him as he joins Southern Miss in the spring.  Success!

He is one of seven junior college players and one high schooler to sign with the Golden Eagles on Wednesday. “If I’m deep I can always see the offensive line and see the holes to read,” Antoine said.

College and Taylor Marini of Copiah-Lincoln Community College; offensive linemen Jacob Fleming of Copiah-Lincoln, early enrollee Ty Pollard of Oak Grove (Miss.)
