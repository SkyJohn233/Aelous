nhl season william nylander toronto maple leafs dec. 12 2017 amy irvin the hockey writers mckenzie said not to oversimplify things but it s pretty elementary tor will make its final best offer to william nylander today he ll either accept it or not it s highly highly highly unlikely tho technically still possible he ll be traded. he later added that he believes a deal will get signed that comes in around six years and at just over the 6.67 million david pastrnak is making with the boston bruins he doesn t believe nylander will get as high as 7 million per season if it gets done it sure seems like the likelihood not to be confused with a sure thing is it being a 6 year deal somewhere just north of david pastrnak s 6 x 6.67m how much north is the obvious key here i d be surprised if it s as high as 7m but we shall see — bob mckenzie tsnbobmckenzie december 1 2018 eval ez_write_tag 300,250 'thehockeywriters_com-medrectangle-3 'ezslot_5',627 0 0 mckenzie said he was surprised there
