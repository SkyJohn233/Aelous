Impact of androgen-deprivation therapy on the immune system: implications for combination therapy of prostate cancer. Aragon-Ching JB(1), Williams KM, Gulley JL. >< Author information:  >(1)Medical Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.< p> >< Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in American men.Standard therapeutic strategies for systemic disease include androgen-deprivationtherapy (ADT) and chemotherapy, both of which are palliative. However, there is agrowing interest in the use of immunotherapy for prostate cancer. Evidencesuggests that ADT may 1) enhance lymphopoiesis and thus potentially improveimmune responses to vaccine, 2) renew thymopoiesis and thus reverse age-inducedthymic involution, 3) augment B-cell development, and 4) mitigate tolerance toprostate cancer antigens. Although no vaccines are currently approved forprostate cancer, there are many promising agents under investigation. This reviewfocuses on recent findings on immune regulation by androgens and immune-systemregeneration with ADT, with emphasis on the rationale for the combination of ADT and vaccines in the clinical treatment of prostate cancer. ><
