Amarula ' s secret recipe revealed                 Cape Town - Distell’s secret regarding the composition of its Amarula Cream liqueur is out and there is speculation that the liqueur’s image could suffer in the eyes of consumers. The question was whether Amarula contained marula liquor alone, or whether the popular drink is spirit- or wine-based. The company’s dilemma arises from a four-year dispute with the South African Revenue Service (Sars) as to the excise duty due on Amarula. Originally 14 liqueurs were involved in a difference of opinion with Sars.  The matter ultimately landed in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria, where a decision against Distell Group [JSE:DST] was given last week. The company now has to pay the tax authority R28m in arrear excise duty. Over the past couple of days wine journalists have busied themselves not so much with the excise duty due for the liqueur, but with Distell’s attempt to keep secret the composition of its successful drink. From the correspondence between Distell’s legal team and the office of the public prosecutor in Pretoria, it appears that on more than one occasion Distell asked for Amarula be kept out of court. In correspondence from the office of the public prosecutor dated December 17 2010, it is alleged that Distell, in a letter dated June 12 2009, had again requested that Amarula not form part of the legal action.  The public prosecutor’s letter goes on to say that this request was based on the fact that consumers would regard any public litigation involving Amarula Cream as negative, and this would lead to huge losses, both locally and internationally.  The letter says that for Distell to appeal successfully against Sars' determination of the new excise category for the product the company will have to prove that Amarula Cream is neither a liqueur nor a spirit-based product, but a wine-based aperitif.  This is a product class that is generally regarded as being inferior to spirit-based drinks such as liqueurs. Various wine journalists reckon this has become a headache for Distell because the use of wine as a base for Amarula would not make it taste any different from other drinks, but might surprise consumers. Dr Gert Loubser, a scientist involved with Distell and Amarula, confirms that there is no difference in the taste of liqueurs made in the different ways. He said that from the outset there has never been any deviation in the method of making Amarula, and consumers can rest assured that what they see on the shelf does not differ from the product on offer over so many years. What does however raise the ire of wine journalists is the fact that for the global market Amarula is indeed spirit-based, but that wine is used for the local market to pay less excise duty. Estimates show that in 2009 Distell sold about 345 000 cases of Amarula, 276 000 of which were on the local market.  Last year Fifa accredited the product as one of two official alcohol products during the World Cup soccer tournament.  - Sake24 For business news in Afrikaans, go to  Sake24.com .                                     The method used to produce Amarula has been widely known for many years. They have an info/tourist centre near Phalaborwa where an intro DVD describes the process used to first produce a wine base from the marula fruit and then add the other ingredients.                                                                     I will allways support Distell  &  SAB - Screw you SARS...Screw you all!!!!!!                                                                             I guess you are also a fan of Al Capone.  Both SAB and Distell, as the major players in their respective fields (beer and wine) operate like the Mafia.                                                                                      Big brother is watching you                                                                                     Hey folks, this to me is just an clever FREE way to advertise and plug the product which, by the way, became so exorbitantly expensive during 2010 soccer that I have since refused to buy it as have many friends and acquaintances. Another case of GREED. Even when family were offered some in Oz and UK they said NO because they had visited and have seen the huge increase it the product - same goes for biltong! But thankfully in the latter I'm a vegan .....                                                                             If they allege that there is no difference in the taste then why don't they sell the wine based Amarula overseas as well??                                                                             Marketing - They market it as a liqueur overseas so have to use a spirit base.                                                                                     because of the duties. did you not read the article                                                                             no wonder i can't get pissed                                                                     SO where is the secret recipe revealed? Headline is a bit sensational.                                                                             My thoughts exactly...where is the secret recipe?!                                                                             Yes S.A.

"Amarula's secret recipe revealed"Blatant lie for a headline. All we know from your article is that the may use spirits or they may use wine. WOW WHAT A REVELATION.                                                                     Who cares if it is based on wine or spirit? I like it and will buy it anyway.                                                                             With you there.. Who cares?? It doesn't alter the way it tastes, and most people drinking the stuff aren't doing so because they are connoisseurs..They drink it because they like they way it tastes.Stupid headline... I was about to rush out and buy a basket of Amarula and other ingredients and whip up a batch in competition :-)                                                                             Why try and keep it a secret - it tastes very similar to Cape Velvet or Baileys Cream. Well if the others are spirit or liqueur, then I'm sure Amarula will be the same bracket                                                                     I'll still drink it.

Give that man a ....Amarula.                                                                      Drambuie is the real deal! It's the nectar of the gods!                                                                     blah blah bottoms up                                                                     I hope Amarula has a long and successful life - we can even buy it at our local store in rural switzerland!!!                                                                     I find the whole story very amusing.  Distell tries to let the public believe they are making a superior product, but tells SARS they are adding a lesser substance for tax purposes. Now Distell must either pay the higher excise duty for adding a superior component, or admit to the S.A. public that they (Distell) was conning the S.A. public by adding an inferior component and don't pay the higher excise duty.  Let us drink a lekker dop to Catch-22.                                                                     SARS -aka - money hungry hyenas                                                                     we have to be proud of our products after all amarula tastes just like other liqueurs so wats the deal, they the french said we cant sell our sparkling wines under the champagne as that its their name and now they with sars want us to stop amarula....i mean wats the difference with  other liqueurs.                                                                     Yah... its a secret, but a liquor my aunt used to make and its sooo moerish... 250ml cream, 1 tin condensed milk, 250ml brandy (cheapest) and two teaspoon instant coffee powder. Mix all together and try refridgerate... Difficult because it dont last long. Make double batches!                                                                     Here I was with pen and paper ready to write down the revealed secret recipe.                                                                     just a pity the government get their grubby little paws on the money  &  unashamedly spend it on extravegance                                                                     I have a suspicion that SARS might be broke and they are trying to get money anyway they can. Why else are they withholding so many companies vat refunds etc?                                                                      Will the price be coming DOWN soon??? That's the important bit.                                                                     you can fool some of the people some of the time, but not All the people all the time                                                                     fong kong amarula..hahaha...so as to not loose face they tried to use a lawyer to get off
