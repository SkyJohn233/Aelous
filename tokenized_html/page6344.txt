biomedical microdevices april 2007 volume 9 issue 2 pp 223–234 cite as conventional micromolding provides rapid and low-cost methods to fabricate polymer microstructures but has limitations when producing sophisticated designs to provide more versatile micromolding techniques we developed methods based on filling micromolds with polymer microparticles as opposed to polymer melts to produce microstructures composed of multiple materials having complex geometries and made using mild processing conditions polymer microparticles of 1 to 30 μm in size were made from pla pga and plga using established spray drying and emulsion techniques either with or without encapsulating model drug compounds these polymer microparticles were filled into pdms micromolds at room temperature and melted or bonded together to form microstructures according to different protocols porous microstructures were fabricated by ultrasonically welding microparticles together in the mold while maintaining the voids inherent in their packing structure multi-layered microstructures were fabricated to have different compositions of polymers and encapsulated compounds located in different regions of the microstructures more complex arrowhead microstructures were fabricated in a two-step process using a single mold to assess possible applications microstructures were designed as microneedles for minimally invasive drug delivery multi-layer microneedles were shown to insert into cadaver tissue and according to design detach from their base substrate and remain embedded in the tissue for controlled release drug delivery over time we conclude that polymer particle-based micromolding can encapsulate compounds within microstructures composed of multiple materials having complex geometries and made using mild processing conditions microelectromechanical system mems techniques have been adapted to fabricate biomedical devices including biosensors aytur et al. 2002 drug delivery systems li et al. 2004 microfluidic channels for biochemical assays carlier et al. 2004 and scaffolds for tissue engineering vozzia et al. 2003 often silicon-based fabrication processes are used to make such biomedical microdevices because of their ability to precisely engineer surfaces li et al. 2004 mcallister et al. 2000 and the expected biocompatibility of silicon voskerician et al. 2003 however silicon-based processes are often expensive especially for disposable medical microdevices noh et al. 2004 as an alternative mems fabrication using polymer materials has been gaining popularity motivated by the large variety of polymers that have a range of physical properties and can meet compatibility requirements of biological and chemical applications bhushan and burton 2005 however the large expense and optical diffraction associated with polymer fabrication by photolithographic methods have limited the development of polymer microdevices xia and whitesides 1998 instead of photolithography micromolding techniques have been developed to fabricate microstructures with low cost simple processing methods and the potential for mass production by injection molding embossing and other methods xia and whitesides 1998 yu et al. 2000 micromolds have often been made of poly-di-methyl-siloxane pdms because pdms is durable optically transparent inexpensive and moldable kim et al. 2000 pdms micromolds have been used to make analytical biological microdevices such as microchips and microfluidic devices shin et al. 2003 jakeway et al. 2000 silva et al. 2004 injectable and implantable microdevices for therapeutic applications have also been micromolded out of biodegradable polymers such as poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid plga because they safely degrade within the body and can be easily molded armani and liu 2000 despite the many advantages of polymer molding conventional micromolding methods have difficulty making microdevices with complex geometries or composed of multiple materials in a single mold using techniques based on injection molding or embossing microstructures with high aspect ratios or complex geometries have been difficult to copy from molds because the high viscosity of the thermoplastic polymer melt often leads to premature cooling of the polymer before it completely fills the mold cavity ahn et al. 2004 the metal molds used for conventional processing are also not friendly to the high aspect ratios of intricate structures furthermore the high temperatures and pressures of traditional processing are not conducive to the copying processes necessary to create structures with multiple compositions or complex geometries polymer microstructures are being developed for a diversity of pharmaceutical biological chemical and mechanical applications involving assays sensors scaffolds and microfluidic channels meeting the needs these many microsystems will require methods to mold microstructures having a wide range of device architectures and compositions to address these unmet needs this study introduces a novel micromolding method based on filling molds with solid polymer microparticles instead of a polymer melt to copy microstructures with complex geometries and composed of multiple materials using mild processing conditions microparticles can flow easily into the cavities of micromolds at room temperature and low pressure which facilitates making microstructures with high aspect ratios moreover polymer microparticles can encapsulate chemical compounds such as drugs and can be filled into molds in sequential layers to accommodate multiple material compositions after filling the mold the final microstructures can be created by welding the microparticles within the mold by plastic welding methods including thermal and ultrasonic welding in this study we demonstrate the ability of this polymer particle-based micromolding approach to fabricate microstructures of varying chemical composition as well as complex and high aspect ratio geometries such as porous and arrowhead-shaped structures we have used polymer microneedles as a case study to examine the capabilities of particle-based micromolding microneedles are arrays of solid or hollow needles measuring microns in dimensions that can painlessly pierce into the skin to deliver drugs in a minimally invasive manner prausnitz 2004 solid polymer microneedles have been made for this application by melting polymers into pdms micromolds under vacuum park et al. 2005 using a similar method polymer microneedles have also been fabricated to encapsulate drugs within the polymer matrix to slowly release drug within the skin park et al. 2006 this system should be suitable for self-administration without the pain or complexity of current controlled release devices based on hypodermic injection it would be advantageous to expand on these capabilities to include microneedles with multiple layers that each contain different polymers and/or drugs to facilitate more complex drug release profiles and delivery of multiple drugs moreover porous microneedles could be useful for applications requiring large surface areas such as using microneedle structures as biosensors or tissue engineering scaffolds microneedles with arrowheads could be useful for better needle retention in the skin the microparticles used to fill micromolds in this study were made of biodegradable polymers—poly-lactic acid pla poly-glycolic acid pga and their co-polymers plga —which are already approved by the food and drug administration fda because they can safely degrade into biocompatible monomers in the body kohn and langer 1996 lee et al. 1997 this class of polymer microparticles has been studied extensively to encapsulate compounds for sustained release for many applications including vaccine delivery lee et al. 1997a b cancer treatment birnbaum and brannon-peppas 2003 hormone therapy lee et al. 1997a b protein delivery jain et al. 2005 gene delivery little et al. 2004 and diagnostic applications lee et al. 2005 these microparticles are typically prepared using an oil-water double-emulsion system spray drying methods supercritical conditioning methods and milling methods benoit et al. 1996 microparticles were prepared from biodegradable polymers using emulsion and spray drying methods the emulsion method was used to fabricate microparticles of various sizes but encapsulation efficiency was low compared to the spraying drying method due to drug loss in the external phase spray drying was used as a simple method to obtain microparticles with efficient drug encapsulation and a monodisperse size distribution albeit limited to microparticles smaller than 10 μm due to the small size of the atomizing nozzle particle size and distribution were measured by scanning electron microscopy 3500 h hitachi tokyo japan and a multisizer multisizer ii beckman coulter fullerton ca using the well-known double-emulsion technique to make pla microparticles benoit et al. 1996 50 mg of calcein was dissolved in 15 ml deionized water in addition 0.2 g of pla l-pla inherent viscosity 1.0 dl/g absorbable polymers international pelham al was separately dissolved in 2 ml methylene chloride sigma-aldrich st. louis mo then 200 μl of the calcein solution was homogenized in 2 ml of pla solution for 2 min at 15,000 rpm powergen 700 fisher scientific pittsburgh pa the resulting water-in-oil emulsion was homogenized in 50 ml of an aqueous solution of 0.1 polyvinyl alcohol sigma-aldrich for 2 min at 10,000 rpm which produced a water-in-oil-in-water double emulsion after mixing the double emulsion for 3 h at 300 rpm the methylene chloride was extracted into the continuous phase i.e. polyvinyl alcohol solution which solidified the discontinuous phase water-in-methylene chloride emulsion into pla microparticles encapsulating calcein microparticles of 1–30 μm in size were isolated by filtration park et al. 2006 polymer microparticles with 0.1 w/w hydrophobic dye oil soluble dye flake candle resource ny were prepared poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid plga 50/50 1.12 dl/g absorbable polymers international and the hydrophobic dye were dissolved in ethyl acetate to form a 3 w/w polymer solution which was spray dried buchi 290 mini spray dryer flawil switzerland using the following process parameters inlet temperature was 55°c outlet temperature was 45–47°c aspirator ratio was 100 and the polymer solution feed rate was 3.5 ml/min to make plga microparticles encapsulating vitamin b by spray drying 5 ml of an aqueous solution continaing 3 vitamin b riboflavin-5′-phosphate sodium salt dehydrate avocado organics lancashire england was emulsified in 100 ml of an ethyl acetate solution containing 3 w/w plga 50/50 by homogenization powergen 700 using the conditions described above except the inlet and outlet temperatures for this process were 60°c and 40–45°c respectively micromolds were prepare by i photolithographically creating a female master mold made of su-8 photoresist ii molding a male master structure out of pdms from the female master mold and iii molding a female replicate mold out of pdms from the male master structure to make the female master mold an su-8 layer was spin coated 1 mm thickness onto a clean silicon water baked at 95°c for 18 h and then exposed to uv light 365 nm wavelength 9000 mw/cm 2 through a mask patterned with square holes the uv exposure was carried out at an angle while the sample was rotated which resulted in a tapered conical shape of non-crosslinked su-8 yoon et al. 2003 sato et al. 2004 the geometry of the microneedle structure was defined by both the geometry of the mask and the exposure angle the su-8 mold was finally formed by developing the non-crosslinked su-8 in pgmea for 12 h. the pdms male master structure was prepared by casting pdms epoxy sylgard 184 dow corning midland mi into the su-8 mold after curing the flexible pdms structure was easily released from the rigid su-8 mold this pdms master structure was then covered with pdms epoxy which after curing produced the pdms replicate mold to prevent bonding between these two pdms structures during the curing process a gold layer of 500 å thickness was sputter deposited on the pdms master structure 601 sputtering system cvc products rochester ny before pdms epoxy casting fabrication of porous microstructures out of polymer microparticles by ultrasonic welding biodegradable polymer

point are melted or a polymer sheet is ultrasonically welded on the top of the mold f the resulting microstructure layered with multiple materials is removed from the mold the process to make microstructures composed of multiple materials is summarized in fig 2 first spray-dried plga microparticles encapsulating 0.1 w/w hydrophobic dye were spread on a pdms mold and pushed into the cavities of the mold by a pdms male master structure excess particles on the surface of the mold were removed by adhesive tape self adhesive tape fisher scientific so that microparticles remained only within the mold cavities the mold was placed in a 140°c oven vacuum oven 1415m vwr west chester pa for 5 min to melt the microparticles and simultaneously held at −70 kpa of vacuum to remove entrapped bubbles park et al. 2005 after cooling this melting process eliminated the voids between microparticles thereby reducing the volume of this layer the final volume of the layer was controlled by the size of the microparticles and thereby the size of the inter-particle voids and the number of times this process was repeated in this way a first layer composed of plga encapsulating hydrophobic dye was created which formed the tips of the microneedles we next formed a second layer which served as the rest of the microneedle shaft and its base substrate a mixture of polyethylene glycol peg 30,000 da sigma-aldrich and spray-dried plga microparticles encapsulating vitamin b was spread on the pdms mold and placed in a 70°c oven at −70 kpa vacuum for 5 min at this temperature the peg melted but the plga tips and the plga microparticles dispersed within the peg did not melt this process formed the second layer of the microstructure in some cases we wanted to create a third layer to give the base substrate different properties to accomplish this excess peg and plga microparticles were removed from the mold surface before the melting step so that they only filled the microneedle shaft after melting and cooling a 250-μm sheet of polystyrene sheet styrene raboesch zeewolde netherlands was ultrasonically welded to the bottoms of the array of microneedles using 5 to 10 pulses of ultrasonic energy at a pulse length of 1 s duty cycle of 50 and pulse power of 105 w at 20 khz as described above fabrication of microstructures with complex arrowhead geometry a polymer

aligned and inserted part way into the mold c the microparticles are melted d the resulting microstructure with a complex arrowhead geometry is removed from the mold microneedles were manually inserted into pig cadaver skin with approval from the georgia tech iacuc with the microneedles still in place a 1 cm 2 piece of skin was placed in a cryomold immersed in o.c.t compound tissue-tek sakura finetechnical tokyo japan and frozen using liquid nitrogen thin tissue sections 12 μm were prepared using a cryostat cryo-star hm 560mv microm walldorf germany maintained at ‒23°c alternating samples were collected on microscope slides micro-frost vwr and later analyzed by microscopy e600 microscope/image system nikon kawasaki japan to visualize insertion of microneedles into human tissue in real time microneedles were inserted into human cadaver cornea georgia eye bank atlanta ga which is transparent and thereby facilitates viewing this use of human tissue was approved by the georgia tech irb microneedles made of a plga tip encapsulating vitamin b and a peg shaft containing plga microspheres encapsulating a hydrophobic dye were inserted into cornea and incubated in a humid chamber at 37°c after 1 h water was applied to the surface of the cornea to complete the dissolution of the peg needle base residual peg was gently removed with wet tissue paper the plga microneedle tips embedded within the cornea were imaged by light microscopy ix-70 olympus mellville ny conventional micromolding methods use polymer melts processed at high temperatures and pressures which are needed to overcome the large shear viscosity of polymer melts e.g. 1,000–10,000 cp given the complexity of the processing conditions conventional micromolding can typically only produce microstructures with uniform composition and relatively simple geometry in this study our goal was to develop methods to make microstructures with multiple materials and complex geometries using mild processing conditions this requires filling the molds with materials that have good flowability at low temperature and pressure through micron-sized openings and high aspect ratio channels to achieve this goal we chose to use polymer microparticles because in the pharmaceutical and other industries the flow of powders has been extensively studied and is known to be easily manipulated and to flow through small channels at mild processing conditions prescott and barnum 2000 the flowability of microparticles is generally much better than polymer melts moveover the flowability of microparticles is generally independent of temperature in contrast to that of polymer melts which require hot processing conditions also unlike polymer melts which often do not fully fill micromold cavities because of the inability of air to escape during rapid polymer injection the space between microparticles allows air to escape and thereby facilitates reliable filling of micromold cavities finally selection of the size of polymer microparticles provides another degree of freedom that can be optimized based on flowability micromold dimensions and other factors microparticles used for particle-based micromolding imaged by scanning electron microscopy a pla microparticles prepared by a double-emulsion technique b plga 50/50 microparticles prepared by spray drying we were also interested to make solid microstructures which required smaller microparticles that pack at greater density and thereby leave smaller voids as shown in fig 4 b irregularly shaped microparticles were prepared by spray drying with a smaller diameter range of 1 to 7 μm and an average diameter of 3.8 ± 5 μm these microparticles were made of plga encapsulating either vitamin b or a hydrophobic dye as model drugs we used microneedles as a model microstructure to investigate the capabilities of polymer particle-based micromolding polymer microneedles have been used to facilitate minimally invasive delivery of drugs into the skin park et al. 2005 but have not previously been molded with multiple layered materials or with complex geometries such as porous structures or arrowhead shapes given the micron dimensions of microneedles this model microstructure provided suitable challenges to assess polymer particle-based micromolding porous microstructure fabricated by ultrasonic welding imaged by scanning electron microscopy a a portion of an array of porous beveled microneedles measuring 600 μm in height and 100 μm in base diameter b a magnified view showing the individual pla microparticles welded together to form the microstructure these results highlight an important difference between polymer particle-based micromolding and conventional micromolding methods the high temperatures and pressures of conventional methods make it difficult to fabricate porous structures with large surface areas unless sophisticated processes are used the ultrasonic welding method uses mechanical vibrations of polymer microparticles at room temperature to cause local frictional heating at the particle-particle interfaces which bonds the microparticles together as shown in fig 5 b the fabrication of porous microneedles was motivated in part by applications involving insertion of microneedles into the skin to serve as biosensors tissue engineering scaffolds or other structures requiring large surface areas previous results have shown that solid pla microneedles with the same geometry as the microneedles shown in fig 5 can insert into the skin without failure park et al. 2005 however the porous microneedles fabricated in this study were unable to insert into human cadaver skin data not shown which is consistent with the expectation that porous structures should be weaker than solid structures park 1980 to enable microneedles to insert into skin porous microneedle strength could be increased by changing microneedle material composition geometry porosity and other parameters microstructures were fabricated with layers of multiple materials by sequentially adding polymer particles and melting them into a mold unlike conventional micromolding using a polymer melt the volume occupied by polymer particles after they are melted within the mold decreases as the melted polymer fills the voids between particles in this way a mold can be completely filled with polymer particles at room temperature but only partially filled after the particles are melted this process can be repeated to fill the mold with layers of different materials the volume reduction of each layer is controlled by particle packing which is in turn controlled by particle size optimally the melting point of the polymer particles should decrease with each iteration to prevent re-melting of polymer already in the mold an iterative process like this by partially filling molds is much more difficult to control using conventional molding methods microstructures layered with multiple materials viewed by brightfield microscopy a b a portion of an array of 200 microneedles is shown at two different magnifications the transparent green tips are made of plga encapsulating green dye and the opaque yellow shafts are made of peg containing plga particles encapsulating vitamin b each multi-layered microneedle has a base length of 250 μm a tip length of 5 μm and a height of 600 μm these results demonstrate that polymer particle-based micromolding can be used to fabricate microstructures with multiple layers of materials with different properties and that different molecules and intact microparticles can be encapsulated within each layer more specifically the microneedle design shown in fig 6 may be useful for drug delivery because it can insert into skin due to the strength of the plga tip and can rapidly separate from its base substrate due to the water solubility of the peg shaft in addition it can deliver two different model drugs at different rates a hydrophobic dye is encapsulated within the plga tips and vitamin b is encapsulated within plga microparticles released from the peg shafts multilayered microneedles inserted and left embedded in human cadaver cornea after intentional detachment from their base substrate viewed by brightfield microscopy multilayered microneedles see fig 6 were designed to have mechanical strength sufficient to insert into tissue afforded by the strength of the transparent green plga tip and water solubility sufficient to detach from their base substrate afforded by the opaque yellow peg shaft in this way microneedles could remain embedded within tissue for controlled release of drugs over time cornea was selected as a model tissue because of its optical transparency that facilitated in situ imaging a b these multilayered microneedles inserted into tissue and detached from their base substrate according to their designed functions multi-layered microneedle inserted into pig cadaver skin cryo-sectioned vertically and viewed by brightfield microscopy multi-layered microneedles fig 6 were inserted into the skin the green plga needle tip penetrated into the superficial dermis and the peg shaft filled with microparticles black dots was partially inserted across the epidermis microstructures with an arrowhead geometry were fabricated to demonstrate polymer particle-based micromolding of complex geometries using a two-step process pla microneedles with a base substrate were first fabricated by polymer melt micromolding these pla microneedles were then aligned by viewing through a microscope and inserted part way into the cavities of a micromold filled at room temperature with plga microparticles after melting and cooling the plga microparticles without melting the pla microneedles due to the higher melting point of pla this process yielded an embedded double-microneedle structure having a plga arrowhead bonded to a pla shaft microstructures with complex arrowhead geometry a portion of an array of 200 microneedles is shown at two different magnifications the yellow/brown arrowheads are made of plga encapsulating vitamin b and the transparent shafts are made of pla each microneedle has a 250 μm base diameter and a 750 μm height a side view b front view microdevices are receiving increasing attention for use in medical pharmaceutical and research applications in part because they can often be molded with a low cost of manufacturing high resolution of feature size and ability to be rapidly prototyped however conventional micromolding methods based on injection molding embossing solvent casting and other approaches can limit the functionality of these microdevices in this study we focused on the limitations imposed on microneedles for drug delivery as a case study example it would be advantageous to develop simple methods to mold microstructures with complex geometries high aspect ratios and composed of multiple materials in a single mold the requirements of conventional molding—i.e. high temperature high pressure and a continuous liquid/deformable polymer phase—are not conducive to the need for multi-functional microdevices to fill molds and solidify evenly throughout the mold polymer particle-based molding described in this study addresses many of these limitations of conventional molding because it is performed under mild conditions as a two-step process first microparticles are filled into the mold at room temperature then thermal or ultrasonic welding is used to connect the particles within the mold with this particle-based process microdevices that have high aspect ratios are composed of multiple materials and contain complex architectures can be more readily replicated an inherent aspect of the polymer particle molding process is that there are voids between the particles filled into the mold for porous structures these voids present the opportunity to weld the microparticles together to form a continuous polymer particle network that maintains the voided structure by selecting the appropriate particle size s the porosity and pore size can be controlled for solid structures these voids can be eliminated upon melting the microparticles and thereby offer the inherent capability to reduce the volume of the polymer particles this facilitates partially filling molds to fabricate microstructures composed of multiple layered materials another aspect of polymer particle molding is that the different melting points of different polymers present opportunities and constraints on the process in general multi-step fabrication processes used to make microstructures with multiple materials or complex geometries require that the first polymer particles used have the highest melting point and subsequent polymer particles have progressively lower melting points while this constrains the choice of polymers and their architecture within the microdevice it nonetheless provides the capability to sequentially fabricate different parts of a microdevice without disturbing previously-fabricated components moreoever the use of ultrasonic welding which selectively heats and bonds at interfaces can relax the constraint on melting points and permit attachment of a higher melting point polymer subsequent to fabrication of a lower melting point component these particle-based processes are influenced by the choice of the size of microparticles to use which depends on the intended functionality of the microdevice and the geometric resolution of the micromold for example the size of the microparticles should be smaller than the smallest feature size of the micromold in order to completely fill it in addition smaller particles are preferred to fabricate solid microstructures due to their higher packing density that more efficiently fills the mold in contrast larger particles are preferred to fabricate porous microstructures which give them a greater void fraction and to fabricate solid microstructures with multiple thin layers of different materials which leads to a greater volume reduction upon melting a final distinction of polymer particle-based molding is that encapsulation of drugs or other compounds within microstructures can be dissociated from the micromolding process for conventional molding processes drugs usually need to be added to the polymer melt and encapsulated during polymer solidification in the mold which can damage the drug and makes it difficult to control the encapsulation process for example to assure uniform drug distribution throughout the device using the methods developed in this study drugs or other compounds can be encapsulated within polymer microparticles during a separate initial step using a variety of well-established techniques such as spray drying and emulsion protocols the encapsulation method can be selected to suit the delivery and stability needs of the encapsulated compounds as a separate subsequent step the microparticles are thermally or ultrasonically welded to form the final microdevice porous microstructures fabricated by ultrasonic welding can be used for a variety of applications that take advantage of their open voids large surface area mild processing conditions that do not require melting the polymer particles and other features the open voids and large surface area lend themselves to biosensor applications in which sensing molecules are coated onto the porous microstructures with high surface-to-volume ratio and to tissue engineering applications in which the porous structure can serve as a scaffold on which cells can grow and the open voids permit transport of nutrients to the cells the mild processing conditions lend themselves to drug delivery scenarios in which the encapsulated drug is not exposed to the high temperature of a polymer melt because the heating during ultrasonic welding is localized to the microparticle interfaces in contrast to these and other advantages porous microstructures are inherently weaker than solid structures which is usually a disadvantage for example the porous microneedles fabricated in this study did not have sufficient mechanical strength to penetrate the skin porous microstructures have previously been fabricated by other methods which typically involve encapsulating inorganic microparticles i.e. porogens within the polymer matrix that are subsequently removed to leave behind porous voids draghi et al. 2005 this approach is limited to microdevice geometries that permit complete porogen removal also this technique includes the use of solvents to remove porogens which can leave a residual toxic solvent in the microstructure or can cause drugs encapsulated in the matrix to be released together with the porogen in contrast ultrasonic welding of microparticles avoids the use of porogens and leaching solvents many microdevices benefit from fabrication using multiple materials conventional molding methods can more easily accommodate mixtures or homogeneous composites of different materials introduced into the mold at the same time however other designs require different parts of a microdevice to have different materials to achieve different local properties this is much harder to do using conventional micromolding techniques unless separate molds are used for each part with a different material the microparticle-based molding methods described here provide a simple method to fabricate microstructures with multiple materials as layers while this capability is not sufficient to fabricate any device design involving multiple materials it can be adapted to accommodate many designs using appropriate mold geometry microparticle size filling strategy and other parameters another limitation of conventional micromolding methods is that it is difficult to remove molded structures that have a cross-sectional diameter larger than the opening of the mold cavity without breaking the mold in the present study we were able to prepare a serrated arrowhead structure without breaking the mold by using a two-step process based on the use of two polymers with different melting points while this technique could be done using a series of conventional molding processes the procedure was simplified by integrating the shaft into the arrowhead mold at ambient condition which was enabled by the use of microparticle-based molding although the arrowhead structure developed in this study was motivated by applications to drug delivery to the skin similar structures might be utilized as radio-frequency antennae and inductors after metallization of the surface despite the many advantages of polymer particle-based micromolding the method has limitations some of which are discussed in the preceding paragraphs in addition it is worth noting that polymer microparticles need to be fabricated by methods that often involve exposure to organic solvents if proteins or other sensitive compounds need to be encapsulated within these particles they may be damaged during the encapsulation process the polymers used to make microparticles must also have good solubility in an appropriate solvent to facilitate particle formation by spray drying or emulsion methods when thermal melting is used the elevated temperature during the melting process can also degrade encapsulated compounds however bulk melting can be replaced by ultrasonic welding or possibly laser welding or radio-frequency welding to localize heating and thereby minimize damage to encapsulated compounds when making multi-layer microstructures care must be taken when filling the micromold to be sure that the cavities are uniformly filled so that the layers are consistently thick throughout the device finally fabrication of multi-layered microstructures also requires that the chemical and physical properties of the polymer and encapsulated compounds be tailored to the needs of each layer due to the limitations of conventional micromolding methods this study tested the hypothesis that polymer particle-based micromolding can encapsulate compounds within microstructures composed of multiple materials having complex geometries and made using mild processing conditions because microparticles flow into narrow channels more readily than viscous polymer melts we found that filling molds with polymer microparticles at room temperature was a facile process that enabled the fabrication of novel microstructures first biodegradable polymer microparticles either with encapsulated drugs or without drugs were prepared by emulsion and spray drying methods porous microstructures with void fractions determined by the packing structure of the microparticles were made by ultrasonically welding the particles together within the mold solid microstructures layered with multiple materials were fabricated using an iterative process of filling and melting microparticles in the mold more complex arrowhead microstructures were fabricated by a two-step molding process the use of microparticle-based molding facilitated encapsulating model drugs within each of these microstructures for controlled release or other applications the microstructure designs investigated in this study were demonstrated in the context of microneedles for drug delivery to the skin where porous microneedles lend themselves to development into biosensors or tissue engineering scaffolds solid multi-layered microneedles could be used to encapsulate different drugs in different parts of the needles for different release properties or to facilitate controlled dissociation of the microneedle shaft within the skin and arrowhead microneedles were designed to enable retention of the arrowhead within the skin for slow drug release after breaking off the microneedle shaft overall this study showed that polymer particle-based micromolding is a versatile fabrication technique suitable to make microstructures with multiple materials and complex geometries using mild processing conditions we thank harvinder gill and jeong-woo lee for helpful discussions this work was supported in part by the national institutes
