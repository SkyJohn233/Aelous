Agreed, especially if the sponsor money wasn't there.  Was there ever a clear answer why they closed up, I can't really recall.  I thought they were having issues w/ their title sponsor Chaparral and thats why just called the team Supercross.com.  No title sponsor.  If they couldn't do it right, they weren't going to do it at all and I don't blame them. IG:  https://www.instagram.com/bturner250/ Wish we knew how it really went down. Not a fan of anyone screwing riders who put their asses on the line. Figured it was more of a LB issues since he jas been known to do riders like that, or so they say...   and of course, Andrew Short being the class act he is, won't say a word....

Because he told him he would in the form of a signed contract. I assume there was a good old fashioned handshake to boot. It seems, judging by that property Jeremy owns, that to fund Andrew for the full year would have been a drop in the bucket to Jeremys net worth. They didn't have to have a Cadillac setup, just a good bike, a salary, some sort of SIMPLE truck and support crew and fly and hotel Short to the races. At the end of 2013 call it quits.

I'd hate to think of MC in the same way as we do LB. That would really suck! One in the same? Have no idea.... Motorcycle Body Armor Protective Gear Built for Progression.

So because he is rich, he should keep funding a business venture that went bad?  Yes he went into a business agreement with the team, and the team signed contracts with sponsors, and signed contracts with riders (Short). So because sponsors pull the plug (breaking contracts), MC himself should personally fund the team? Great way to end up broke. Sad to see someone as humble as MC, willing to open his home to the internet public, and he gets blasted for a business decision that went south due to no fault of his own.

I am sure MC, Brooks, and anybody else involved were operating under a LLC or some other vehicle to protect their personal wealth. Seems like nobody knows what INTEGRITY is anymore. Stiffing people in the name of "business" is a low life, shitty mentality and I hope people who live like that get what they deserve! If a damn contract was signed then there is NO EXCUSE for stiffing Short REGARDLESS of his performance. They knew he was a midpack guy but he's also a midpack guy in the toughest series on the fucking planet!  Enabling thieves by calling  it "bussiness" is utter bullshit! Not saying Mc is either but I can't stand the bullshit "business" excuses I read on here! "Business" will never be a good reason to be a half assed, lying, cheating scumbag!

To this day he is still the only rider I have posters of hanging in my shop. Even my autographed Ricky posters are rolled up and in a closet. I have always looked up to him more for his down to earth, human demeanor in addition to his revolutionary skills on a motorcycle.

I agree, I wouldn't go broke funding Andrew Short or any other rider either. Its just after seeing that lavish house I came to the conclusion that to keep his end of the deal with Andrew wouldn't have put much of a dent in MCs net worth. I guess we should blame Scott Witt of the now defunct Langston/Witt team for helping me feel the way I do. His team folded and what did he do? He kept his end of the deal with Les Smith by providing everything he said he would and found a good transport for him in BTO Sports KTM. On a personal note, back in 2008 I signed contracts to sell product to a couple of buyers. When the market collapsed the value of the product went down by half, yet these buyers...who were the ones to offer me the deals in the first place... kept their word and paid me the original contract price we agreed on. THEY WILL FOREVER HAVE MY LOYALTY, as I know their word and thus their integrity is well and good. I'm sure Jeremy is a great guy,.
