cookbook together and now a year and a half later i 'm jumping head first into running a food blog i am 100 a girl that craves predictability and control over every possible situation so this is completely exciting terrifying and exhilarating all at the same time i no longer know who i am how i got here or where my new adventure is going to take me but i 've got ta admit i 'm kinda liking it so here is your personal welcome to join me in my new journey i 've got a tattered food stained notebook full of recipes that i 'm just dying to get into your homes my brain is going non-stop imagining and planning all the things i want to be incorporated on this here blog but here 's a taste of what to expect- 1 food obviously right more specifically i want to feel your homes with my families favorite recipes my crazy ideas remember the pressure cooker vanilla extract i 've got more where that came from lots of pressure cooking recipes featuring my favorite electric pressure cookers instant pot and fagor lux multicooker lots of whole grains lots of naturally sweetened desserts and of course the occasional over the top dessert so my kids never forget i 'm their favorite mommy chef 2 my life is all about family i find great happiness in being with my family and refer to these bits of pure joy as the the good life i 'm so passionate about this i 've dedicated an entire section of my blog to it and i ca n't wait to start filling it up 3 -in the short 13 years i knew my father on earth i learned to crave knowledge and learning from his intense example my desire to learn a subject to the max can on one hand be a curse the other hand a blessing but regardless of what it is it is always an opportunity to share with others what i 've learned i 'll be referring to this in a little section i 'm calling healthy living it 's ever evolving of course but i am anxious to get these life lessons into your hands so here we go there are so many empty spaces on my new

reality as i realize i 'm a wife a mama a daughter and a nurse practitioner and can only do so much so have patience with me i owe so much to my sister cami for bringing me along on this adventure it
