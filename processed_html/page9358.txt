Provisions in force                     The provisions displayed in this version of the legislation                    have all commenced.                    See  Historical Notes Authorisation             This version of the legislation is compiled and maintained in            a database of legislation by the Parliamentary Counsel ' s Office            and published on the NSW legislation website, and is certified            as the form of that legislation that is correct under section            45C of the             Interpretation Act 1987 .         This website is Version Ver.  Rev.  The NSW legislation website is underpinned by the data set developed by the Parliamentary Counsel's Office using Standard Generalised Markup Language (SGML), which is an International Standard (ISO8879) for the descriptive markup of documents. The website is built using LEGIS, a document management system used by PCO to manage the complete lifecycle of legislation from the initial drafting of instruments through to the publication and ongoing maintenance of legislation. The website and LEGIS are both built using the TeraText ®  Database System which is a high-performance, highly scalable repository that natively supports both SGML and XML. The website and systems were developed by Leidos Pty Ltd . The In Force database in XML format is available to download for free from links on each version in the In Force collection. See the DTD and information in XML files for the In Force collection . This XML data comprises all versions of both current and repealed consolidated legislation in the In Force database, but does not include the As Made database, Bills or the Gazette. The XML data reflects the updated legislation on In Force which is progressively updated on most days. To minimise possible effects on users of the legislation website, any processes to automatically look for and pick up updated XML data should be timed to run outside normal business hours in NSW. PDF files generated from NSW legislation are delivered directly from the site's HTML using the Prince formatter by  YesLogic Pty Ltd .

Features such as the use of Boolean operators, fielded, proximity, phrase and wildcard searches/queries are available. Amended in Committee  refers to when a Bill has been amended in committee by a house of Parliament. Applied laws  are laws of other jurisdictions and other governmental instruments that are applied as laws of NSW. A list of applied laws can be generated here NSW Applied Laws in Force .

Document menu  means the light blue menu available in the fragment view when viewing documents in the In Force collection in desktop view mode, and from the Document menu button in mobile view mode. It includes buttons for functions such as Search Title, Historical Versions and Whole Title views. DTD  stands for Document Type Definition for SGML or  XML  documents. A DTD defines the components of a set of documents and the sequence in which those components or elements may occur. SGML  and XML  require the validation of all documents in a set defined by a DTD against that DTD to ensure that, broadly, all required elements are present, all elements occur in the correct sequence and that no undefined elements are used. The In Force legislation collection is created from an SGML database using specialised legislation DTDs. Environmental planning instrument (EPI) means a State environmental planning policy or a local environmental plan (LEP) (including the Standard Instrument LEP) and, except where otherwise expressly provided by the  Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 , includes a deemed environmental planning instrument .

Historical notes  contain a detailed table of amending instruments and commencement details and a clause by clause amendment history. Historical notes for an Act or instrument in the In Force collection can be obtained by pressing the "Historical notes" link in the document menu. HTML  stands for Hypertext Markup Language. This is the non-proprietary language most commonly used for publishing online and is the format used for the In Force legislation on this site. In Force legislation  refers to legislation in the HTML consolidated legislation part of this website. All Acts (principal and amending), all principal statutory instruments (regulations, rules, by-laws etc) and all principal environmental planning instruments (EPIs) are added to the site as they are assented to or published, irrespective of whether they have commenced.

Parent Act  is the Act under which a Regulation or other instrument is made. The Parent Act option on the document menu for regulations and other instruments in the In Force collection is a link to the parent Act for that instrument. PDF  stands for Portable Document Format. This is an international standard format that maintains precisely the same appearance as the printed page and provides a high level of document integrity. This format is used for the static versions of As Made legislation, the Gazette and Bills and as an option on all In Force legislation and other pages. See  Generating PDFs . Click here to get your Acrobat Reader . Regulations  is often used in NSW as a general term for statutory instruments. Regulations link  in the document menu for an Act in the In Force collection links to a list of regulations and other statutory instruments made under the Act. The Regulations link does not list the EPIs that are made under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979  because they comprise the entire EPI collection. Regulations as Made  means Regulations, Rules, By-laws, Proclamations, etc as published on this website or in the Gazette. On this site they are maintained in PDF  as a static collection of Regulations and other instruments starting from 1990 and are added to progressively as new instruments are made. Responsible (or Portfolio) Minister  means the Minister administering a particular Act. This information is available on the Status information page for current Acts in the In Force collection that have been allocated to a Minister. See also  Allocation of the Administration of Acts . SGML  stands for Standard Generalized Markup Language (ISO 8879:1985), the international standard for defining descriptions of the structure of different types of electronic document. SGML is very large, powerful, and complex. It has been in heavy industrial and commercial use for over a decade, and there is a significant body of expertise and software to go with it. XML  is a subset of SGML. Source data  is legislative source data that is available for purchase from the PCO. The data consists of the In Force legislation database only and is updated on a weekly basis. The only format supplied is XML  and a DTD  (document type definition) is available on request. For further details please contact parliamentary.counsel@pco.nsw.gov.au . Status information  for an item of legislation in the In Force collection may include: information about the currency of the legislation, information about whether or not all of the provisions of the legislation being displayed have commenced, information on Bills, uncommenced legislation, repeals, resolutions and other matters that may affect the future operation of the legislation, warnings if the legislation has been declared invalid (in whole or in part), is affected by retroactive amendments or contains suspended provisions, information about whether the legislation has been repealed and the date on which it was repealed, information about the expiry date for the legislation, the name history of the legislation where its name has changed over time, information concerning an instrument that was originally made under one Act and that is currently taken to be made under another Act, information about whether the legislation is due to be automatically repealed under the Subordinate Legislation Act 1989  and the current repeal date for that legislation, an authorisation statement. The status information for legislation can be obtained by pressing the "Status information" link in the contents view for an item of legislation. Statutory instruments  is a general term used to describe the range of instruments made under an Act. In NSW these instruments include: regulations by-laws environmental planning instruments orders proclamations rules, including rules of court determinations notices. Tables  refers to a selection of generated legislation tables  containing information about the status of Acts, statutory instruments, environmental planning instruments, and associated matters. The tables are generated from the In Force, As Made and Bills collections and are printable and downloadable in HTML and PDF. An  archive of superseded and miscellaneous Tables  is also available. Whole title is a feature that enables you to view and print a whole Act or other instrument and is accessed from the "Whole title" button in the document menu for an item of legislation currently being viewed. XML  stands for Extensible Markup Language. See also  SGML . Need legal advice or research assistance? Information indicating the portfolio Minister is provided on the Status Information page for individual Acts in the In Force collection. The Allocation of the Administration of Acts sets out the Ministers who are responsible for the administration of particular Acts (or part/s of Acts) and for any Regulations etc made under those Acts. The Allocations are approved by the Governor. The current version of the Allocation of the Administration of Acts is found in the In Force database under Regulations. Searching In Force and Repealed legislation Searching As Made legislation Searching Bills Searching a single title Section 3.20 (previously section 33A) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (the EPA Act) provides that the Governor may prescribe the standard form and content of local environmental plans or other environmental planning instruments (called a standard instrument). The current standard instrument is prescribed by the Standard Instrument (Local Environmental Plans) Order 2006. An environmental planning instrument (EPI) may be made that declares that the standard instrument provisions are adopted, and may also prescribe other matters as provided under section 3.20 of the EPA Act. EPIs made this way are referred to as standard instrument local environmental plans. The plans are automatically amended when the standard instrument is amended, and other amendments to the plans are affected by the requirements of section 3.20 and the standard instrument. If an EPI is a standard instrument local environmental plan, this is indicated under “About this Plan” on the Status Information page for the EPI in the In Force collection.

This material is produced from the database compiled and maintained by the Parliamentary Counsel's Office. The collection is in 3 categories: This collection is continuously updated and any amendments are usually consolidated and annotated with currency details, tables of amendments and clause-by-clause histories within a 3 day period of their commencement. In addition to the currently in force material, the In Force database also contains historical versions of current legislation, providing point-in-time access. All titles in the In Force database have complete sets of historical versions from a base date of 1 January 2002. Selected titles in the In Force database have more extensive collections of historical versions, for example the  Crimes Act 1900 , and the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 , and additional historical versions of key titles are in the process of being captured. Private Acts are mainly 19th century Acts that passed through Parliament as Private Bills. They generally affect only a single individual or corporation and have a very limited application. A small number of titles with a wider and continuing application, are included on the In Force database. A list of all Private Acts is available in the Legislation tables section. All Acts as enacted from 1824 are included in the  As Made  database. The website also contains repealed legislation from a base date of 1 January 2002, and historical versions of that repealed legislation. Selected instruments repealed prior to that base date are targetted for capture. In these cases usually a single version, as in force immediately prior to the date of repeal, is available. For example the  Interpretation Act 1897 , Local Government Act 1919  and Traffic Act 1909 . References in the text of In Force legislation to NSW legislation link to In Force titles where available. If no In Force title is available (eg because the title is an amending regulation or EPI or an instrument that predates the In Force collection), the reference will link to the As Made title (see  As Made  database for a description of this collection). A link to an As Made title is only available if the legislation has and is referred to by a unique name. Legislation that only has a description or generic label (such as 'Commencement Proclamation') will not link even though it may be available in the As Made collection. References to legislation of other jurisdictions will not link except for Commonwealth legislation, which links to the Federal Register of Legislation. See also  Related links . Information indicating the Responsible Minister is provided on the Status Information page for current Acts in the In Force collection. See also  Allocation of the Administration of Acts . The As Made database is a collection of over 22,000 instruments in PDF. The collection is added to progressively as new legislation is made and consists of 3 categories: These are static documents and form a permanent archive of Acts, regulations etc and EPIs as they were originally passed or made. Lists of these instruments are available from the Tables section. The Bills collection contains Bills at all stages of the Parliamentary process (eg First Print, Second Print, Passed by both Houses) and Explanatory notes for Bills as introduced into Parliament. The collection covers the period from 1987 onwards. These are static PDF documents and form a permanent archive. Bills are grouped by the current Parliamentary term and then collectively for previous years. This material is usually updated with the addition of new Bills, and updates to Bill information and PDF versions, within 3 days of the relevant Parliamentary event. The material is provided for research purposes only. The  NSW Parliament website  should be used for tracking the daily progress of Bills through Parliament and other Parliamentary information. These is also a collection of consultation drafts of Bills publicly released before Introduction. This collection can be browsed and searched separartely and covers the period from 1999 onwards. Notification-Gazette pages give official notice of the making of new statutory instruments (regulations, rules, commencement proclamations etc), environmental planning instruments and the publication of the NSW Government Gazette. Each Notification-Gazette page includes links to the listed instruments, which are located in the As Made database, and to Gazettes, which are located in the separate Gazette collection. Notification-Gazette applies to the following: Notification-Gazette is published on a cumulative basis each week and includes a permanent archive for previous weeks and years. The collection of Gazettes for browsing and searching covers the period from 2001 onwards. Departments, agencies and local councils should refer to the FAQs for notification and gazettal requirements. Local councils  should also refer to the Information about the drafting and making of delegated LEPs and the website of the Department of Planning and Environment . The scope of instruments notified separately on the legislation website and available from the As Made database instead of the Gazette includes some other instruments of a legislative nature (for example, orders, directions, guidelines, standards or other instruments) that are not statutory rules (ie regulations, by laws or rules made by the Governor-in-Council) or environmental planning instruments. These are commonly referred to as "miscellaneous statutory instruments". These instruments are often not drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel's Office. However, the following technical requirements apply to these instruments: The legislation information menu contains overviews on how to read legislation, constitutional legislation that applies in NSW and how legislation is made. The menu also includes links to legislation tables. These tables provide summaries of information about instruments in force and as made, applied laws, repealed instruments, Bills, and commencement information and can be generated to show information as at a specific date or over a specified period. The tables include links to In Force or As Made versions of the instruments where applicable. This section also includes links to superseded print-based tables (including the former Legislation in Force guide) and other miscellaneous ancillary research material. See  Archive of superseded and miscellaneous tables . Applied laws are the laws of other jurisdictions and other government bodies that are applied as laws of NSW. Some applied legislation is not currently available on this website. A  list of applied legislation is available in the  Legislation tables  section. A number of unamended Private Acts are not included in the In Force database. See  Private Acts of NSW . Deemed environmental planning instruments  under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979  are not available online. The NSW legislation website is established under Part 6A of the Interpretation Act 1987  as the official NSW government site for the online publication of legislation and the Gazette. Section 45C (5) of the  Interpretation Act 1987 enables the Parliamentary Counsel to certify the form of legislation or Gazettes that is correct. Most of the legislative content and all the Gazettes on this site have been so  certified  by the Parliamentary Counsel. In particular the following are authorised: See also the previous certification for 2008 and 2013 . The following categories of legislative content have not been certified at this stage: These items should be treated as being reference documents only and users should exercise their own skill and care with respect to the use of the material. The authorisation of the legislation on this website is the product of a long process of moving from paper-based to electronic access to legislation. This process is one common to many Australian drafting offices, and was described in a paper given at the Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel (CALC) conference in Hong Kong in April 2009. The long march: pen and paper drafting to E-publishing law is a modified version of that paper. Legislation in the In Force collection is generally drafted by the NSW Parliamentary Counsel's Office (PCO), which also maintains this website. Specifically, the following are drafted by PCO: However, some other instruments of a legislative nature in the In Force collection (for example, some orders, directions, notices or guidelines) may be prepared by other agencies. These instruments can be identified by information under the heading “Drafting agency” on the Status information page of the In Force version. The identification of an agency as preparing an instrument applies to the original instrument and not to any amendments. The names of agencies are historical information and are not updated if the agency is renamed or changed. XML files are available for all versions in the In Force collection, including current, repealed and all historical versions. Download pages for the XML for each title use the following URL structure: for the current version, https://legislation.nsw.gov.au /#/view/type/year/no/xml . For example, https://legislation.nsw.gov.au /#/view/act/2015/26/xml . for any historical version, https://legislation.nsw.gov.au /#/view/type/year/no/historicalYYYY-MM-DD/xml . For example, https://legislation.nsw.gov.au /#/view/act/2015/26/historical2016-02-01/xml . There are also manual icon links on the Status Information page and full fragment for each version. Pages and links can also be accessed through scripting. See also XML download collection query options below, for how to access XML sets according to particular update criteria. If there are graphics associated with an XML file, the download page will also contain links to those graphics. Graphics are only available in GIF format. Standard queries are available using this syntax: /#/export/day  returns all versions updated in any way since the beginning of the current calendar day /#/export/week  returns all versions updated in any way in the last week (7 days) Custom fields are also available that can be used individually or in combination by using AND or OR. Syntax: /#/export/custom/"field"[operator]value For example, /#/export/custom/ "Last Updated">20160601000000 Fields with more than one word must be used in quotes (eg "Last Updated"). Fields with only one word do not need quotes (but can also be used with quotes). Please note that unlike the Advanced Search that has you write into a form, export custom queries are written to the url, and as such need to be URI-encoded. For example, to query for  "Historical Document"=2008?  you would need to visit  /#/export/custom/"Historical %20 Document"=2008 %3F Results are returned in HTML format. For results in JSON format, omit  /# . For example, https://legislation.nsw.gov.au /#/export/day  ⇒  https://legislation.nsw.gov.au /export/day The XML data reflects the updated legislation on In Force which is progressively updated on most days. The XML files use the ExchangeXml.dtd (version 3) . Attention is drawn to the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License conditions in that DTD, and also the information about copyright for NSW legislation generally. To minimise possible effects on users of the legislation website, any processes to automatically look for and pick up updated XML data should be timed to run outside normal business hours in NSW.

Adobe Reader contains many capabilities specifically designed to make it easier for people with disabilities to read PDF files, regardless of whether the files have been optimised for accessibility. The online tools also include a facility to convert PDF documents to either HTML or ASCII text. For more information about reading PDF content, visit the Adobe website . You can use the "Generate a PDF for this page" icon to create a PDF with standard headers and footers for any HTML page on the website - including any part of In Force legislation. The PDF icon for the desktop view is on the right of the dark blue menu bar for a page: For the mobile view, the PDF icon is in the lower section of the main Menu: IMPORTANT - to make a PDF of a whole title of legislation,  select the "Whole title" button first . The "Whole title" button can be found on the light blue document menu. Then click on the PDF button on the dark blue menu to make the PDF. For legislation, the PDF will be  of the page that is currently displaying in the right hand fragment view , which is the "Status information page" when you first display an In Force legislation title. To make a PDF of the whole title or another part of the legislation, you must select another view. If you are currently viewing part of an item of legislation (for example, one section of an Act), then the PDF will only be created for that section. To choose what to include in the PDF: To make a PDF of the whole legislative instrument including the Contents, click on the "Whole title" option, then the generate PDF icon. To make a PDF of the whole legislative instrument without the Contents, click on the name of the instrument at the top of the Contents (this will make the whole instrument appear in the fragment view), then the generate PDF icon. To make a PDF of a particular Part or similar component, click on the Part or component in the Contents (this will make that component appear in the fragment view), then the generate PDF icon. You can use the same generate PDF icon to make PDFs of other pages on the website, including the Tables . The PDF will generate in a new tab of your browser. Once generated, you can use the PDF in the same way as other PDFs, including for the following: printing saving a local copy saving in another format (for example, Word or text) adding comments or annotations reflowing or adapting the file for mobile use. To link to the home page, type the following into your document, email, or browser shortcut properties: http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au To link to the main Search page, use the following link: http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/search To link to the main Browse page, use the following link: http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/browse http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/ type / year / number Substitute  type  with: Substitute  year  with the year in which the instrument was made (usually the year in its title). Substitute  number  with the number of the instrument. This will link to the Status Information page of the title. Examples: To link to the Crimes Act 1900 No 40, use the following: http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/ act/1900/40 To link to the Deer Regulation 2008 (438), use the following: http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/ subordleg/2008/438 To link to the Wollongong City Centre Local Environmental Plan 2007 (30), use the following: http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/ EPI/2007/30 These links will always go to the current version if the instrument is in force, or the last version if the instrument is repealed. Note. The following link syntax cannot be guaranteed to remain static, for example if individual components are renumbered or a comprehensive restructuring of an instrument occurs. Abbreviations: sec  is used for section,  chap  for Chapter,  part  for Part,  div  for Division,  subdiv  for Subdivision, sch  for Schedule (Note. links are only available to the top level of the schedule, not to its components) In the case of statutory instruments which are Rules use  rule. , and for Regulations use reg. In EPIs  cl  is used instead of  sec . Examples: To link to section 20 in Division 1 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 No 40, the link would be: http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1900/40/ part3/div1/sec20 To link to rule 1 in Part 2 of the District Court Rules 1973 (01), the link would be: http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/subordleg/1973/01/ part2/rule.1 In most browsers you can also right click on the provision you want to link to in the contents and select Copy Link Location, and then paste this to create a link. To link to regulations made under an Act, use the following link: http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/year/number/regulations For example, to link to regulations listed under the Stock Foods Act 1940 No 19, use the following: http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1940/19/regulations To create a link to the whole title view of an instrument, add "whole" to the instrument link. For example, to create a link to the whole title of the Crimes Act 1900 No 40, use the following link: http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1900/40 /whole http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/ type / year - number .pdf Substitute  type  with: year  is the year the instrument is made. number  is the number of the instrument. For example, to link to the As Made PDF of the Graffiti Control Act 2008 No 100: http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/acts/2008-100.pdf To link to the As Made PDF of the Mine Safety (General) Regulation 2009 (2009-109) http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/regulations/2009-109.pdf To link to the As Made PDF of the Hastings Local Environmental Plan 2001 (Amendment No 72) (2009-100): http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/EPIs/2009-100.pdf Maps in zoomable PDF are provided for standard-based environmental planning instruments in the In Force collection. This feature was introduced in late 2007. These instruments are drafted on the basis that significant planning content (such as land application, land use zoning, building heights, floor space ratios and heritage areas) will be displayed on maps rather than described in the text of the instrument. A "Maps" button appears on the light blue document menu if maps have been provided for a particular instrument. The Maps button and references in the text to maps are linked to an index page that provides access to the individual maps. This index page has also been designed to provide point-in-time functionality. You need the Adobe Reader to view these maps Download Adobe Reader . To magnify and view more detail in the maps, there are several zoom functions available: on the zoom menu bar of your PDF viewer, click on the - and + symbols to change the zoom level, or type or select a percentage in the Zoom box, you can also right click with your mouse and select this function, on the zoom menu bar, change the magnification options to Dynamic Zoom. You can then use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out by dragging the mouse up and down or by turning the mouse wheel, you can also right click with your mouse and select the Dynamic Zoom function. To print an area of a PDF map where you have zoomed in, select Print from the File menu. Under Print Range, select "Current view". To print the entire map, the Print Range selection should be set to "All". If you have Adobe Acrobat Professional you have extra functions available: on the zoom menu bar, change the magnification options to Loupe. This opens a magnified area of the map in a small window. As you move around the main PDF screen, the portion of the map in the magnification window changes, to have the main PDF document in a small window and the magnified area as the larger document, change the magnification option to Pan  &  Zoom Window instead, you can also right click with your mouse and select the Loupe or Pan  &  Zoom functions. The index page also shows pin links to the State planning agency interactive Planning Viewer on the NSW planning portal website. The map content on the portal has not been certified as correct under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 . For current maps in the format in which they were officially approved, refer to the PDF maps on this website as available from the index page. The site navigation links in the main blue bar contain the following selections: Search : enables you to search consolidated legislation currently in force or repealed. Browse : contains two categories (In Force and Repealed) of three alphabetical lists of consolidated versions of the three categories of legislation: one for Acts, one for Regulations and the other for EPIs (environmental planning instruments). Notification-Gazette : contains links to the official online notification feature and Gazette searching and browsing. As Made : has links to Search As Made and Browse As Made. Search As Made  enables you to search legislation in the form in which it was originally enacted or made. This legislation is stored in PDF format. Browse As Made  contains three alphabetical lists relating to legislation in the form in which it was originally enacted or made. The first list relates to Acts; the second list to Regulations (listed under their parent Act); and the third list to EPIs (environmental planning instruments). Bills : has links to Search Bills and Browse Bills. NSW Bills  includes Bills (including Explanatory Notes) at all stages of the Parliamentary process, from 1987 onwards. There is also a collection of Consultation drafts of Bills publicly released before introduction, from 1999 onwards. LegInfo : contains information about using and understanding legislation, including a Guide to interpreting NSW legislation , and overview of How legislation is made and the Legislation tables (which contain a series of generated information tables about legislation, including repeals and commencements). There is also a collection of superseded print-based tables and other reference material. Links : contains useful related links (including legislation, Bills, Gazettes, Parliaments and drafting organisations of other states, territories and countries). The grey site navigation links at the top right of the page contain: Home : takes you to the home page for the NSW legislation website. About : contains information about the NSW legislation website. Contact : contains contact information. Help : contains detailed help for using the NSW legislation website. Mobile View/Desktop View : toggles between the two viewing modes for the website. The grey site navigation links at the bottom of the page contain: What's new : contains the latest information about the website. Accessibility : contains accessibility information in relation to the website. Sitemap : contains the sitemap for easy navigation around the website. Copyright and Disclaimer : contains copyright and disclaimer information in relation to the website and legislation. In Force and Repealed legislation is set out in two parts: Contents view on the left and Fragment view with navigation options and text on the right. The  Contents view  contains a linked table of contents for the legislation, including whole instrument, Chapters, Parts, Divisions, Subdivisions and Schedules, as well as individual sections or clauses. When a link is selected in this view, the detailed text of that selection is displayed in the  Fragment view . The  Fragment view  contains document navigation items and text for the link selected in the  Contents view . The navigation items in this view include: In the mobile view, the Contents view and navigation options are combined into the Document menu. The following Word files are available to help you prepare various instruments and notices. Not all instruments have a template. Principal instrument Amending instrument General notice General notice with Schedule Appointment notice Court practice note Council notice – general Council notice – sale of land Erratum Your instrument needs to be notified if: it is a statutory rule as defined in the Interpretation Act 1987 (that is, it is a regulation, a by-law made or approved by the Governor, or a court rule), or it is a commencement proclamation for an Act, or it is a local environmental plan or State environmental planning policy, or the legislation under which the instrument is made requires it to be “published on the NSW legislation website”. The Parliamentary Counsel’s Office (PCO) has started a process of modernising the Gazette and refocusing its role and use as part of the NSW legislation website. As part of this process, from 2 May 2019, only instruments (which includes notices) where legislation explicitly states that it must be published or notified in the Gazette will be accepted. All instruments must clearly and accurately cite the legislation title and publication provision. As a result of this change, some categories of instruments previously published in the Gazette will generally not be accepted for publication. The categories of instruments that may no longer be published in the Gazette include: Those instruments where there is no provision in legislation that specifically states the instrument must be published in the Gazette. This is a general category, and the following instruments are also in this category. Estate, probate and other notices that can be lodged or searched in the NSW Online Registry . State funeral notices. See now  News and Events on the NSW government website . Notice of assents to Acts. This information is available from the NSW Parliament House website . Appointments and delegations where no legislative requirement exists. However, if there is a requirement in the legislation for gazettal, then these must still be gazetted. Notifications required to be given under the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth or the regulations under that Act where lodgement is instead required on a website provided by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Notices by the Minister for Police or NSW Police Force of rewards offered for information about disappearances/murders. See now  NSW Police Force – Rewards Offered . Publication of changes of name details for individuals or similar matters relating to the Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages. You should carefully check the legislative requirements for instruments when preparing them and before requesting gazettal. See also the Templates available on www.legislation.nsw.gov.au . If you have questions about an instrument you have previously lodged or may need to lodge that is in one of the above categories, please contact nswgazette@pco.nsw.gov.au . Individual agencies may also make their own arrangements for publishing instruments on their websites or in other appropriate places. Notices that have been published in the Gazette cannot be removed or altered. However, in most cases where the gazetted instrument did not match the signed instrument, an erratum notice can be used to correct the gazetted instrument. Note that not all notices can be corrected, and that errors and erratum notices can cause legal problems. An erratum notice is published in addition to the original notice. The original published notice will not be changed. An erratum notice must contain at least the following: The Gazette date, Gazette number and page/notice number of the original notice. For example, “NSW Government Gazette No 211 of 13 February 2015, p 112” or “NSW Government Gazette No 83 of 27 January 2018, n2018-423”. The wording that was incorrect and the wording that should replace it. If it is important for the gazettal date to remain the original date, the words "the gazettal date remains [insert original gazettal date]" should be added to the notice. An erratum notice should be submitted to nswgazette@pco.nsw.gov.au in the same way as a standard notice . This website enables you to shop online to purchase professionally printed copies of NSW legislation from LitSupport (TIMG), the preferred supplier of hard copy NSW legislation. To streamline orders for printed legislation, you can link directly from this website to the dedicated LitSupport (TIMG) online ordering system for NSW legislation. All versions of in force and repealed legislation on this website have an associated delivery van icon located on the blue task bar on each status information page. By clicking on a delivery van icon you’ll be redirected to the LitSupport (TIMG) website where you can place an order for the legislation you’re viewing and set up an account if you wish. The system recognises which legislation you want to order and automatically adds it to your shopping cart, making the ordering process very straightforward. The cost, which is based directly on the page count, will also be calculated. You’ll be able to choose the format for your printed copy—A4 or B5 size, hole-punched or not. (Holes can be punched in a configuration that fits the binders formerly produced for storing hard copies of NSW legislation or to fit an A4 two-ring binder.) All titles are printed in black and white unless the title contains coloured graphics (e.g. road signs or maps)—these titles will be automatically printed in colour at a slightly higher cost per page. Printed copies are posted to your nominated address or, in the Sydney CBD, they will be delivered by courier free of charge. The In Force collection is in HTML. To print or save a PDF version of a fragment or whole title, see  Generating PDFs . To print an HTML fragment (which usually contains a whole section or schedule) click on the printer icon in the top right corner and then follow your usual print setup instructions. To view or print a whole title, choose from the following: for the whole title with the table of contents included, click the  Whole title  button in the main fragment window. This enables you to view a complete version of an item of legislation in HTML with a linked table of contents. for the whole title without a table of contents, click on the title of the instrument at the top of the table of contents. This gives you a complete version in the fragment window without the table of contents. In either case you can click on the printer icon in the top right corner of the window and then follow your usual print setup instructions. You can also copy and paste the HTML text (Edit > Select All > Copy, or click and drag to select the text) to the clipboard and paste into a word-processing application such as Microsoft Word (Word 2000 or later provides the best print display), or into a text editor such as WordPad. The As Made collection is in PDF (Portable Document Format) and can be viewed, downloaded and printed in the standard way for that application. For more information about PDF, visit the Adobe website or you can Download Adobe Reader . Legislation in the In Force collection can be generated as a PDF using the icon on the dark blue menu bar. The Parliamentary Counsel's Office does not provide or sell printed copies of legislation. If you would like to obtain printed copies of legislation there are several options available: You can print out the legislation you require free of charge from the legislation website: As Made titles and the Government Gazette are made in PDF and can be printed in that format. In force titles can be printed as HTML or by generating a PDF version from the   icon on the blue taskbar. You can print directly ( Ctrl + P  or  Print button) from the HTML version of legislation you see on the screen. The printout will reproduce the view of the title you have displayed on-screen—single section, whole part, whole title etc. You can also copy from the HTML version by highlighting the required text, copying and pasting into a Word or other document. Copying from HTML avoids the hard returns that occur when copying from a PDF version. You can download the PDF of the legislation you require onto your computer and then either save it onto a USB drive and take it to any print shop or email it to them and they will print it for you. You can go to your local library to access the legislation website and print out the copies you require. NSW amending Acts are automatically repealed after they commence by section 30C of the Interpretation Act 1987 . This is for a number of reasons: This practice of repealing spent amending Acts is not unique or new to NSW. At one stage the amending Acts were repealed in batches twice a year as part of the statute law amendment process and from 2006 to 2008 contained a self-repealing clause. It should be noted that once an amendment of a Principal Act that is made by an amending Act has commenced, the repeal of the amending Act does not affect the amendment that has been made ( section 30 of the Interpretation Act 1987 ). This screen enables you to search consolidated in force and repealed legislation. These databases are partitioned into three major types of legislation: Acts, Regulations etc, and Environmental Planning Instruments (EPIs). Before searching, you should first select the database and types of legislation you wish to search by selecting the appropriate check box/es in the area under "What do you want to search over?" The default search selection is over the "Acts in Force"  and "Regs etc In Force" databases. There are two forms of searching, the most commonly used being the Standard search. The two forms of searching operate exclusively and separate search buttons are provided for that reason. (The Advanced search feature is for more specialised searching using Command Control Language. Boolean operators should not be used in the Standard search.) The Standard search has a range of pre-defined search fields that are listed below and it also enables you to search over the text or title of legislation and to limit your search to a particular year and/or instrument number. These fields enable you to limit your search as follows: exact phrase will find only those documents that contain those words as a phrase. all of the words will find provisions in documents that contain all of the words that you enter in this field. For example, this search can be used to find documents with sections or other provisions that contain all of the words "offence", "penalty" and "defence". any of the words will find those documents that contain any one of the words that you enter in this field. without the words will find provisions in documents that do NOT contain the words that you enter in this field. This field is often used in combination with the other fields, for example to find sections or other provisions in documents that contain the word "offence" but not the word "imprisonment". You can enter words into all or some of the input fields shown—the search will take them all into account. The search fields are not case sensitive and do not require quotation marks around words or phrases. The wildcard characters "?" (any number of characters) and "#" (exactly one character) can be used in all fields except exact phrase - see Advanced search. Search in The  "text"  and "title" selections cause the search to be applied to either the text of documents or to legislation titles. Note.  A  "title" search covers the official titles of legislation, not the titles of Chapters, Parts, Schedules etc. Limit search to year/number will apply the search to instruments assented to or made in that year, or with that instrument number. If you want more control over your searching, you can use the Advanced Search  option. It requires queries to be entered using the Common Command Language (CCL)—an international standard for text queries. Please note that the Search scope that you have selected with the checkboxes under the "What do you want to search over" field DOES apply to the Advanced Search. Note also that if you type a query into the Advanced Search field, then no other field will be taken into account, except the search scope, ie the types of legislation you chose to search under the "What do you want to search over?" field. Advanced Search options such as Boolean operators and proximity queries will return results of documents that contain individual provisions (such as sections) that meet the search criteria. These types of Advanced Searches only apply at that provision level and are not applied to the document as a whole. CCL features are outlined below AND, OR, NOT can be used between terms. For example  jury AND district NOT sheriff Using the syntax "FIELD=word", the search can be restricted to individual fields. Useful fields in this database include: Text:  The full text of the document. Title:  The title of the Act, Statutory Instrument etc. ActNo:  Act Numbers. SRNo:  Statutory Instrument Numbers. EPINo:  Environmental Planning Instrument Numbers. Year:  Year of Act, Statutory Instrument, EPI. Heading:  Text of all headings for Chapters, Parts, Divisions etc. An example fielded search is  Heading=certified and Text=appeal Fielded searches are NOT available for the Search As Made or Search Bills. ?  means any number of characters and  # means exactly one character. For example: fee?  would match "fee","feedlots","fees" wom#n  would match "woman" or "women" If you want to search for two words near each other then the  "%"  character can be used to indicate the number of words you will allow between the two terms, whatever the order of the words. If you want to search for words near each other in a particular order, then the "!" character can be used to indicate the number of words you will allow between the two terms. For example: right %3 appeal would find "right" and "appeal" within 3 words of each other, in any order. right !3 appeal would find the words within 3 words of each other where "right" occurs before "appeal". Parentheses can be used to group search terms. For example, to find expressions such as the Corporations Act, Companies Act, Corporations Code or Companies Code use the following syntax: (corporations OR companies) %3 (code OR act) Similarly you can combine proximity and grouping searches. For example: building %3 (code OR regulation) OR building !3 (code OR regulation) would find "code" or "regulation" where occurring after "building". To modify or refine your search, go back to the search screen or select search again. Your search criteria will show and can be modified and the search run again. To start a new search, click the clear button at top right on the search screen. The NSW legislation website has been operational for 8 years. The website was rebuilt in 2008 and redesigned to take advantage of new technology, provide additional features for users, and improve its overall performance. Most significantly, the new system architecture provides the assurance necessary for the official authorisation of much of the online legislative content, including the use of the legislation website for the official publication of new regulations and other statutory instruments. However, the overall segmentation of the website into the HTML In Force and PDF As Made collections has been retained. Also, the core way in which the website works for users, including the search and browse functionality, is essentially the same. Display of Schedules or Appendices with attached or 'embedded' documents. If a Schedule/Appendix etc contains an embedded document, the Schedule/Appendix now displays with a + (plus) next to it in the table of contents: Addition of a "mini" search feature to all Browse lists. Addition of Acts as enacted from 1824—1989 to the As Made archival collection, to extend access to historical legislation. NSW Bills (including Explanatory notes and Consultation drafts) are now available on the NSW legislation website. This is a collection of Bills at all stages of the Parliamentary process (eg First Print, Second Print, Passed by both Houses), of Explanatory notes for Bills as introduced into Parliament and of Consultation drafts of Bills publicly released before introduction. The collection includes all Bills introduced from 2007 onwards. These are static PDF documents and form a permanent archive. This material will be constantly updated and the addition of new Bills, and updates to Bill information and PDF versions, will usually be completed within 3 days of the relevant Parliamentary event. A selection of user-generated interactive tables is offered by the NSW Parliamentary Counsel's Office to provide information about the status of Acts, statutory instruments, environmental planning instruments, and associated matters. The current tables are generated from the constantly updated NSW legislation database and are printable and downloadable in various formats from this website. The following tables are currently available: See also  Archive of superseded and miscellaneous Tables The NSW Bills collection (including Explanatory notes and Consultation drafts) has been extended and now includes Bills from 2003 onwards. This is a collection of Bills at all stages of the Parliamentary process (eg First Print, Second Print, Passed by both Houses), of Explanatory notes for Bills as introduced into Parliament and of Consultation drafts of Bills publicly released before introduction. The collection includes all Bills introduced from 2003 onwards, and a separate collection of Explanatory notes from 1990-2002. These are static PDF documents and form a permanent archive. This material will be constantly updated and the addition of new Bills, and updates to Bill information and PDF versions, will usually be completed within 3 days of the relevant Parliamentary event. On 1 January 2014 the NSW Government Gazette moved from a print-based subscription service to official online publication on the NSW legislation Website. Printed copies of the Gazette, and quarterly bound volumes, are no longer being produced and distributed. The Interpretation Act 1987 has recently been amended to authorise the Gazette to be published on the legislation Website and to give official status to the online version of the Gazette. The Gazette is now compiled by the Parliamentary Counsel's Office and the contact information for lodgment of notices in the Gazette from 1 January 2014 is:    email: nswgazette@pco.nsw.gov.au    telephone (02) 9321 3356 Copy for inclusion in the Gazette should be emailed in Microsoft Word format by close of business on Wednesday for publication in Friday's Gazette. Only electronic lodgment of notices for publication will be accepted. Access to the latest authorised edition of the Gazette in PDF format is through the Notification-Gazette page (previously the Notification page). The first link on that page displays any Gazettes published in the current week as well as any recently published statutory instruments and Bill information. Gazettes are provided in the form of a single numbered Gazette PDF. Special supplement Gazettes are published as required and the regular Gazette continues to be published on Friday. Special Gazettes are no longer re-compiled into a weekly Gazette digest. The new Gazette search facility enables a single electronic search across multiple Gazettes (for Gazettes since 2001). A link on the Notification-Gazette page takes users to the search interface. Users can also access the search facility directly at: www.gazette.legislation.nsw.gov.au . Through the search interface users are able to search across the Gazettes using words or phrases and are able to limit their search to a single publication date or a date range within the scope of this collection. The search database also includes all statutory instruments and environmental planning instruments published since 2001. Gazettes, Gazette Indexes and FOI Gazettes can also be browsed through links on the Notification-Gazette page. Each item of legislation in the In Force database has a table of contents, some of which can be quite long. To improve navigation options, the detail in this table can now be fully expanded or collapsed at Chapter or Part level by clicking on the Expand or Collapse buttons at the top of the contents. In addition, individual provisions such as Chapters, Parts, Divisions and Subdivisions can be collapsed or expanded as needed by clicking on the show/hide arrow to the left of the provision. To make the most of the updated features for mobile and desktop access, you may need to update or change your web browser. Older browsers may not support these functions as well as newer ones do, and may be slower. This site works best in Chrome and Firefox, but is also effective in Safari. Internet Explorer is not recommended. If you encounter a technical problem, please check your browser. You can also send us feedback by contacting the Webmaster The website now senses and responds to mobile phones and tablets. In this mode, there are a number of display differences, including menus that stack to fit on all screens, scrolling alphabets for browse lists, the option to switch between the text and the table of contents for In Force legislation, and improved date picker options for the legislation tables. Other changes that make mobile use easier include accordions to shorten and improve the readability of the general text pages, and the use of icons for quick visual reference. The main menu includes a link so you can toggle between the desktop and mobile layouts whenever you want to. The frames previously used to create the different areas on the website, such as the table of contents for In Force legislation, have been removed. This makes the legislation easier to navigate for users of assistive technology. "Skip to content" links have been added on all pages to provide for more flexible keyboard navigation of legislation. The entire website now meets level AA criteria under the WCAG guidelines. For more options and information about the accessibility functions, including access keys, see Accessibility . Explanatory notes for Bills introduced into Parliament and passed before 2006 that were previously available as a separate collection have been integrated into the main Bills collection. All Bills and Explanatory notes back to 1987 can now be searched and browsed together. See  Bills . URLs have been updated to make them more meaningful and easier to see, and to make linking more intuitive. All existing links will continue to work on the updated site. Most features and functionality of the website are unchanged, but the overall presentation of the site has been modernised and streamlined. Fonts, colours, information pages and menu links have also been updated and refreshed. This is a collection of bills covering the period of 1896-1958 and are available in PDF format. The collection consists mostly of bills that were printed but not introduced into Parliament at the close of a particular session. Some of the bills were introduced but then lapsed and some were introduced and subsequently passed in a later session. The bills are often stamped as being a "rough draft for consideration only" and some contain explanatory notes. References in the text of In Force legislation to titles that are only available in the As Made PDF collection now link to that collection. Previously, links to NSW legislation in the In Force text were limited to other titles in the In Force collection. These links can most readily be seen and used from the Historical notes of In Force titles, such as in the Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 2000 . If an In Force version (whether still current or repealed) is available, the link will continue to be to that version. Links to As Made titles provide direct connections to amending statutory instruments (including EPIs) and to Acts that were repealed before the legislation website was created and so do not form part of the In Force collection. While most references to titles will now have a link, there are some limitations: the collection in As Made of statutory instruments only goes back to 1990 for regulations, SEPPs and similar instruments, and 2001 for LEPs, so no links are available before then links to older Acts and principal instruments that are not in the In Force collection will be to the As Made version (not the legislation as amended). Various records for researching changes to legislation can be found on the LegInfo menu, under Legislation Tables  < Archive of superseded and miscellaneous tables a link is only available if the legislation has and is referred to by a unique name, but some legislation only has a description or generic label (such as 'Commencement Proclamation'), so these items will not link even though they may be available in the As Made collection the former methods used to create and update components of legislation may mean some links are not available, for example in the Historical notes where amendments may have been referred to by a description or a dete instead of a title as previously, references to legislation of other jurisdictions will not link (except Commonwealth legislation, which will continue to link to the Federal Register of Legislation).

A new way to make PDFs of In Force legislation has been added to the website—see the "Generate a PDF for this page" icon on the main dark blue menu bar. You can now: generate a PDF for any component of in force legislation, from whole titles to Parts, Schedules and individual sections generate a PDF for any component of historical versions of legislation (for example, the Crimes Act 1900 as it was in 1977) generate a PDF as and when you need it, whenever a change is made to legislation See also the detailed "How to" information in Help . IMPORTANT—to make a PDF of a whole title,  select the "Whole title" button first . The "Whole title" button can be found on the light blue document menu. Then click on the PDF icon on the dark blue menu. This new PDF option replaces the previous static PDF file that was available only for some legislation titles and often not available at all for historical legislation. These previous PDFs were manually prepared and difficult to maintain in an up-to-date form for current legislation. They were also limited to whole titles only, instead of having a choice of which part of legislation was available as a PDF. This previous PDF service has been discontinued. The new Legislation Information (LegInfo) menu includes overviews of how legislation is made in NSW and constitutional legislation in NSW. There is also some information on how to read NSW legislation, including a Guide to interpreting NSW legislation . The Legislation Tables formerly available from a separate menu are now part of the LegInfo menu. (May 2018) The In Force collection is now available for download in XML format.

The constitutional arrangements in place for New South Wales are governed by the following Acts of New South Wales, the Commonwealth and the United Kingdom: Constitution Act 1902 Commonwealth Constitution (which was originally set out in section 9 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (UK)) the Australia Acts (which are the Australia Act 1986 (Cth) and Australia Act 1986 (UK)) Statute of Westminster 1931  (UK) Imperial Acts Application Act 1969 Succession to the Crown Act 2015  (Cth) The Constitution Act 1902 (NSW) provides for the following essential features of the system of government for New South Wales: a Parliament of New South Wales constituted by the Queen and 2 Houses (the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council) with power to make laws for the peace, welfare, and good government of New South Wales 4-year fixed term for Parliaments a Governor of New South Wales to exercise the powers of the Queen in relation to New South Wales an Executive Council, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries (including provisions for administrative arrangements concerning the allocation of Acts and portfolios among them) a Consolidated Fund into which all public money must be paid unless an Act provides differently, with appropriations from that Fund requiring the authorisation of an Act the maintenance of a system of local government provisions to ensure that certain laws cannot be made unless they have been approved at a referendum (including laws seeking to abolish the Legislative Council or change how the Houses of Parliament are elected) provisions to resolve deadlocks between the Houses of Parliament over Bills provisions to ensure that Judges of courts (including the Supreme Court) cannot be removed from office by the Governor unless it is on an address from both Houses of Parliament, in the same session of Parliament, seeking removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. The Commonwealth Constitution established a federation on 1 January 1901 consisting of the Commonwealth and the States. In relation to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Constitution provides for the following: a Commonwealth Parliament constituted by the Queen and 2 Houses (a House of Representatives and a Senate) with legislative powers over specified matters a Governor-General to represent the Queen and exercise her powers in relation to the Commonwealth a Federal Executive Council and Ministers the High Court of Australia and such other federal courts as the Commonwealth Parliament may establish. In relation to the States, the Commonwealth Constitution provided for the former colonies (including New South Wales) to become States and preserved their existing laws and constitutions. The Commonwealth Constitution also created some limitations on the power of State Parliaments to make laws, including the following: a State cannot make laws that apply to the seat of government of the Commonwealth or places acquired by the Commonwealth for public purposes a State cannot impose customs or excise duties a State cannot coin money a State law cannot discriminate against Australian citizens resident in other States a State law cannot discriminate against interstate trade, commerce or intercourse a State cannot raise or maintain a naval or military force without the consent of the Commonwealth Parliament a State cannot impose a tax on Commonwealth property a Commonwealth law prevails over an inconsistent State law. The Australia Act 1986 (Cth) and Australia Act 1986 (UK) were enacted in virtually identical terms at the request of each of the States. The principal purposes of the Acts were: to terminate the power of the United Kingdom Parliament to make legislation for a State to remove restrictions on the power of a State Parliament to legislate extra-territorially or repeal laws of the United Kingdom to provide for the Governor of a State to be the representative of the Queen in relation to the State to require the Queen to exercise her powers (including the power to appoint or remove a Governor) only on the advice of the Premier of the State to abolish appeals from State courts to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. The Statute of Westminster 1931 (UK) enabled the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate extra-territorially and to repeal laws of the United Kingdom if the Parliament had power to do so under a head of power set out in the Commonwealth Constitution. The Statute also made it clear that it did not give power to the Commonwealth Parliament to amend the Commonwealth Constitution except as provided by the Constitution or to make laws within the authority of the States unless it was authorised by the Constitution. The Australia Acts prevent the amendment or repeal of the Statute by the Commonwealth unless it has been requested by all of the States. The Imperial Acts Application Act 1969 (NSW) provided for the continuation in force of certain English or British Acts, and the repeal of other English or British Acts, in their application to New South Wales. It also reproduced certain provisions of some of the Acts that were repealed with continuing relevance for New South Wales. In particular, certain Acts (called constitutional enactments) set out in Part 1 of the Second Schedule to the Act were preserved, including Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights of 1688 and certain Acts relating to the succession of the Crown. The Succession to the Crown Act 2015 (Cth) was enacted at the request of each of the States and mirrors legislation in other countries (including the United Kingdom) that have the Queen as Head of State. The principal object of the Act was to provide that succession to the Crown was not to be determined by reference to the sex of a person. As a result, the first child (whether male or female) of the monarch will be first in line to the throne. The Act also amended or repealed some of the English or British Acts (including some preserved by the Imperial Acts Application Act 1969 (NSW)) relating to succession to the Crown in their application to Australia and its States. The following documents outline some of the drafting practices of the NSW Parliamentary Counsel’s Office ( the PCO ). These documents express the official views of the PCO concerning those practices, as explained in DP1: Using PCO drafting practice documents . DP1: Using PCO drafting practice documents DP2: PCO Plain language policy DP3: PCO Gender neutral language policy DP4: Drafting savings and transitional provisions DP5: Legislative definitions The legislation of New South Wales is generally drafted by the NSW Parliamentary Counsel's Office, which also maintains this website. Although the Parliamentary Counsel's Office chooses the words used in legislation, it does not choose the policy that is being implemented and is not involved in how it is administered. Questions about the policy contained in legislation or its administration should be raised directly with the relevant Government Department (in the case of Acts of Parliament and legislation made by the Governor) or the person or body that makes the legislation (in other cases). The Parliamentary Counsel's Office cannot assist you with these questions. There are 3 main types of legislation made in New South Wales: Acts of Parliament Subordinate legislation Environmental planning instruments An  Act  of Parliament (sometimes called a Statute ) is a law that has been: passed by both Houses of the Parliament of New South Wales (that is, the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council), and assented to by the Governor on behalf of the Queen. An Act commences life as a proposed Act (called a Bill ), which is introduced and debated in both Houses of Parliament. A Bill is sometimes amended by a House of Parliament during its passage. There are 2 kinds of Bills: A  Government Bill  is a Bill that is introduced into Parliament on behalf of the Government by a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary A  Non-Government Bill  is a Bill introduced into Parliament by a Member of Parliament in his or her capacity as a Member (and not on behalf of the Government, although sometimes on behalf of an opposition party) Each House of Parliament has a special procedure (governed by its own standing or sessional rules and orders) for how a Bill should be introduced, debated, amended and passed. The website for the Parliament of NSW contains further information about these special procedures. A Bill that is passed by both Houses of Parliament must be signed by the Governor (which is called giving  assent  or the Royal assent ) to become an Act. When the Governor assents to an Act, it is said to have been enacted . The commencement of a new Act will depend on the commencement section (usually section 2). It may be the date of assent, a later day specified in the commencement section or a day that is left to be appointed by the Governor by a future proclamation. Subordinate legislation  is law made under the authority of a power conferred by an Act of Parliament. On this website, subordinate legislation is simply listed under, or referred as, regulations even though it includes other types of instruments. Acts often confer the authority to make subordinate legislation on the Governor. However, Acts sometimes confer the authority on other persons or bodies (for example, Ministers, courts and tribunals and public officials). The most common example of subordinate legislation is a statutory rule. Section 21 (1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 defines a  statutory rule  to be: a regulation, by-law, rule or ordinance made by the Governor, or a regulation, by-law, rule or ordinance made by another person or body that must be approved or confirmed by the Governor (for example, a University by-law made under section 36 of the University of Sydney Act 1989 ), or a rule of court (which is a rule made by the person or body having power to make rules regulating the practice and procedure of a court or tribunal). However, the Governor no longer makes ordinances. Part 6 of the Interpretation Act 1987 provides that written notice of the making of a statutory rule must be tabled before each House of Parliament within 14 sitting days after it is published on the NSW legislation website (that is, this website). Either House of Parliament may pass a resolution that disallows a statutory rule at any time after it is published. However, notice of a resolution to disallow a statutory rule must be given no later than 15 days after the written notice of its making is tabled. A statutory rule can be disallowed even if only one House of Parliament passes a disallowance resolution. The disallowance of a statutory rule operates to repeal it and to reinstate the legislation in force before the changes made by the statutory rule. Also, section 8 of the Subordinate Legislation Act 1989 prevents the remaking of a disallowed statutory rule (in substantially the same terms) for 4 months. Examples of other kinds of subordinate legislation include (but are not limited to) the following: proclamations made by the Governor that commence provisions of Acts, proclamations made by the Governor that alter local council areas or amalgamate them under the Local Government Act 1993 , rules made by the Legal Profession Admission Board concerning the admission of lawyers, water sharing plans made by order under the Water Management Act 2000 , proclamations, orders, notices or other instruments that operate to amend an Act (see, for example, final determinations under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 ). Subordinate legislation that is not a statutory rule cannot be disallowed by Parliament unless the Act under which it is made expressly provides for it. See, for example, section 26 of the Marine Estate Management Act 2014 , which provides that proclamations under that section can be disallowed in the same way as statutory rules. All statutory rules must be published on this website before they can take effect. Other subordinate legislation will usually be required to be published in either the Gazette or on this website by the Act under which it is made. Environmental planning instruments  (sometimes called "EPIs") are local environmental plans ("LEPs") and State environmental planning policies ("SEPPs") that are made under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 . Environmental planning instruments, unlike statutory rules, cannot be disallowed by Parliament. Although they are made under the authority of an Act, environmental planning instruments are treated as being a distinct category of legislation separate from other subordinate legislation. Local environmental plans are made for particular local government areas. They are made either by the Greater Sydney Commission (if it relates to land in the Greater Sydney Region under the Greater Sydney Commission Act 2015 ) or the Minister for Planning (if it relates to other land). They may also be made by a delegate of the Commission or the Minister. New local environmental plans usually adopt certain provisions specified by the Standard Instrument (Local Environmental Plans) Order 2006 made by the Governor under section 33A of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 . State environmental planning policies are made for either the whole of the State or special areas of the State. They are all made by the Governor. All environmental planning instruments and amendments to the Standard Instrument (Local Environmental Plans) Order 2006 must be published on this website before they can take effect. An  Act  (sometimes called a Statute ) of New South Wales (a NSW Act ) is a law that has been: passed by both Houses of the Parliament of New South Wales (that is, the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council), and assented to by the Governor on behalf of the Queen. A proposed NSW Act is called a  Bill while it is in the Parliament and may be amended by either House of Parliament during its passage. See also  How legislation is made . This information is limited to how to read NSW Acts and does not necessarily explain how the Acts of the Commonwealth and those of the other States and Territories should be read. Generally speaking, there are 2 kinds of NSW Acts: A  principal Act  is an Act that contains substantive legal provisions that are not limited to the repeal or amendment of other legislation. An example of a principal Act is the Crown Land Management Act 2016 . An  amending Act  is an Act that is limited to provisions that either repeal or amend other legislation (or both). An amending Act typically has the word "repeal" or "amendment" (or both) in its name. See, for example, the Industrial Relations Amendment (Industrial Court) Act 2016 . The use of an amending Act is not the only way in which other legislation can be repealed or amended. It is common practice for amendments and repeals of other legislation to be included in a principal Act (usually in schedules) if they are required for the principal Act to come into force. Section 30C of the Interpretation Act 1987 will repeal an amending Act once all of its repeals or amendments have commenced unless the Act provides differently. This will usually occur on the day after it is fully commenced. However, the repeal of an amending Act does not undo any of the repeals and amendments it makes because of section 30 of the  Interpretation Act 1987 . An amending Act usually has 2 structural elements: the  body  of the amending Act, and the  schedules  to the amending Act. The typical amending Act will include only the citation and commencement sections for the Act in its body. Any repeals or amendments will usually be located in one or more of its schedules. If the repeals or amendments are limited in nature, they may sometimes be included in sections in the body of the Act rather than in schedules. In  Commissioner of Taxation v Consolidated Media Holdings Ltd [2012] HCA 55 at [39], the High Court of Australia summarised the basic approach to statutory interpretation (sometimes called  statutory construction ) as follows: "'This Court has stated on many occasions that the task of statutory construction must begin with a consideration of the [statutory] text.' So must the task of statutory construction end. The statutory text must be considered in its context. That context includes legislative history and extrinsic materials. Understanding context has utility if, and in so far as, it assists in fixing the meaning of the statutory text. Legislative history and extrinsic materials cannot displace the meaning of the statutory text. Nor is their examination an end in itself." Here are some practical tips to follow when interpreting NSW Acts: The ordinary meaning of text is always the most important starting point. If the text has a clear and unambiguous meaning, the courts will give it that meaning. To understand an Act, you need to look at it as a whole document rather than as a discrete set of provisions. It is wrong to read provisions in isolation without considering other provisions (for example definitions that might be located somewhere else in the Act or savings and transitional provisions located at the end of the Act). If a provision of an Act could have more than one meaning, section 33 of the  Interpretation Act 1987,  requires the meaning that promotes the purpose or object of the Act to be preferred to a meaning that would not. The purpose or object of an Act can sometimes be found by looking for purposes or objects expressly stated in the Act. However, often there will not be an express statement in the Act. Sometimes the purposes or objects are obvious simply by looking at what the Act is dealing with. In some cases, looking at relevant extrinsic material will be useful. Extrinsic material  is material that is not included in the text of the Act. Section 34 of the  Interpretation Act 1987  permits the use of certain extrinsic material to confirm the ordinary meaning of an Act or to determine the meaning of ambiguous or obscure provisions or provisions whose ordinary meaning would lead to manifestly absurd or unreasonable results. Examples of relevant extrinsic material are the explanatory note for the Bill introduced in Parliament that resulted in the Act and speeches made by Ministers and other members of Parliament about that Bill. Although the definitions for terms used in the Act will ordinarily be included in the Act, sometimes they will be found in the Interpretation Act 1987 . For example, section 21 of that Act defines certain words and expressions that are commonly used in legislation. The Interpretation Act 1987 has many other provisions that are useful when reading Acts and should be consulted before deciding whether or not an Act deals with a matter. See also  Guide to interpreting NSW legislation . From the first Executive Council meeting after the 2019 State election, instruments drafted by PCO and made at Executive Council meetings that are to be published on the NSW legislation website will be published or notified automatically on the Friday immediately following the relevant Executive Council meeting. A request for the instruments to be published or notified will no longer be needed. If you do not want your instrument published or notified the following Friday, please ensure the Explanatory Note accompanying the instrument contains an indication to this effect. Also, please contact notification@pco.nsw.gov.au no later than 1pm on the Thursday following the relevant Executive Council meeting. This does not affect the ability to have instruments published or notified urgently.

The instrument will NOT be gazetted unless a request is received. The instrument will not automatically be gazetted just because it has been approved by the Governor at a meeting of the Executive Council or otherwise signed. Notices will be published in the Gazette as follows: You will receive email confirmation of receipt of your notice within 24 hours on weekdays. Please contact PCO if you have not received confirmation within that time. If a notice needs to be gazetted urgently it must be accompanied by confirmation from a senior manager that the notice must be published earlier than the next ordinary Gazette. Where time permits, an initial phone call should be made to advise of the upcoming request, even if the notice for gazettal is not yet ready. In any case, the notice should be submitted (as an attachment) by email to nswgazette@pco.nsw.gov.au as soon as possible. Telephone inquiries: 9321 3333, 9.00 am to 5.00 pm, Monday to Friday. Email: nswgazette@pco.nsw.gov.au A request for publication or notification of instruments not automatically notified should include the following: the full name of the instrument, and if the instrument was drafted by PCO, PCO’s file reference, which is on the top of the Opinion relating to that instrument or on the bottom left hand side of the instrument itself, and the proposed publication date, and if the instrument did not go to the Executive Council, a scanned copy of the signed front page (as an attachment), and if the instrument was not drafted by PCO, a generated PDF file of the instrument (as an attachment). You will receive email confirmation of receipt of your request within 24 hours on business days. Please contact PCO on (02) 9321 3333 if you have not received confirmation within that time. For publication or notification on a Friday: the request should be sent to PCO by 5.00 pm on the Wednesday of that week the instrument will then generally be notified on the Friday of the same week notification on the Friday occurs as soon as PCO has relevant files ready (usually early in the day). Urgent or special publication or notification can be arranged at other times if required. Requests for special publication or on other days or times should be made by telephone as soon as possible, but preferably no later than 1.00 pm on the day in question. Telephone inquiries: 9321 3333, 9.00 am to 5.00 pm, Monday to Friday. Email: notification@pco.nsw.gov.au For legal interpretation and accessibility reasons, the use of graphics in legislation such as Acts, regulations and environmental planning instruments is generally limited. In addition, searches on the In Force collection on the NSW legislation website do not search over words appearing in graphics. However, where they are clearly necessary or useful, graphics can be included in legislation subject to the constraints and specifications set out below. Typically, graphics in NSW legislation consist of: Line art drawings Diagrams Simplified maps and plans Flowcharts Where graphics are required, as early as possible in the drafting stage: the use of the graphics should be discussed with the drafter. graphics in the required file format should be supplied in time to allow review and revision as needed (see below for the required file format). the required file format is TIFF (Tagged Image File Format), with the following specifications: format version 5 or 6 or equivalent 300 dpi or, if the detail in the graphic requires it, 600 dpi, and 256 8-bit greyscale or colour, and if a TIFF cannot be supplied, liaise with the drafter about other options. scanned images are not of sufficient quality and will not be accepted. Except for resizing where required to fit in standard NSW A4 legislation format, PCO does NOT create or edit the content of graphics such as maps, diagrams etc. These must be supplied by the agency. Only some flowcharts may be created and managed by PCO by prior arrangement. PCO will create a GIF file from the TIFF for website publishing. Graphics should have the following features: Headings, captions and other descriptive text should not form part of the graphic. This information will be included as text so that it is searchable. The graphic should have portrait orientation unless the dimensions make landscape necessary. Landscape graphics should be rotated counter-clockwise relative to portrait. Most graphics should not have borders, except some maps where the borders give the area definition in the page. Graphics must be sized to fit appropriately in the legislation to which they relate, and in any case cannot be larger than the space in the standard text margin for NSW legislation based on an A4 page (210mm × 170 mm). Graphics should be cropped to a maximum of 2mm white space. Colour should only be used where it is important for the meaning of the graphic (such as in road signs). In Bills, graphics must be greyscale for printing reasons. If colour is required for a Bill, check with the drafter at PCO about options. Maps must have a scale bar and north point. Do not use scale measures such as 1cm=1,000m as the size of the graphic will change. Photographs are not suitable for inclusion in In Force legislation. Graphics should look sharp and clear and not pixelated or blurry. PCO may advise on and change the size, alignment in the text and similar layout aspects of the graphic to make it display effectively in legislation. PCO will not change the content of the graphic. Agencies preparing their own instruments for publication on the NSW legislation website or in the Gazette should prepare graphics/images as follows: The graphics should be included in the text of the instrument (they should not be separately supplied for publication). Graphics must be sized to fit appropriately in the instrument and fit on a standard A4 page with margins of 20mm. Headings, captions and other descriptive text should not form part of the graphic. This information should be included as text to improve searchability. Graphics should have portrait orientation unless the dimensions make landscape necessary. Landscape graphics should be rotated counter-clockwise relative to portrait. Photographs should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Line art drawings, diagrams, maps and plans are more suitable for legislation. Graphics should not be scanned images. If your instrument is expected to be included in the In Force collection on the legislation website, the technical requirements under Instruments drafted by Parliamentary Counsel’s Office (PCO) should also be considered. See below for important information about Government notices, Council notices and Private notices. Please note that PCO will NOT provide legal advice in relation to the drafting or content of a Gazette notice. If necessary, you should obtain legal advice in order to check that your notice complies with any legislative requirements. See recent Gazettes for examples of the content and layout of notices. PCO will NOT check your notice and the notice cannot be altered or withdrawn once gazetted. A notice will need an erratum or to be remade if there are errors. Errors will also affect users trying to search for or reference the notice. Notices are important legal documents. All care should be taken by you to ensure they are correct. Before submitting a notice please check the following: all necessary approvals have been given and signed, text and other content is correct and complete. PCO reserves the right to apply its in-house style to all Gazette notices if needed. Notices for any Government Notices section of the Gazette should contain at least the following details: A main heading that is the name of the legislation under which the notice is made. This can be more than one item of legislation. A secondary heading may be added to provide more specific detail as to what the notice relates to eg "Notice of Compulsory Acquisition of Land", "Declaration of Crown Land as Public Road" etc. In the general text of the notice, the provision/s of the legislation (ie legislation listed in the main heading) that requires the notice to be published in the Gazette. If the notice takes effect on a date other than the date on which the notice is published in the NSW Government Gazette, a clear statement of this date. Where the notice contains a signature, then the name of the signatory needs to be typed in the notice and not included as a scan of the signature. This also applies to any date of signing included in the notice. Council Notices should contain at least the following details: A main heading that is the name of the Council. A second heading that is the name of the legislation under which the notice is made (more than one piece of legislation may be listed, if relevant). A third heading can be included to provide more specific detail (eg "Dedication of Public Land"). In the general text of the notice, the provision/s of the legislation (ie legislation listed in the second heading) that requires the notice to be published in the Gazette. Where the notice contains a signature, then the name of the signatory needs to be typed in the notice and not included as a scan of the signature. This also applies to any date of signing included in the notice. Private Notices should contain at least the following details: A main heading that states the nature of the notice (for example, "Notice of Final Meeting"). A second heading that is the name of the legislation under which the notice is made (more than one piece of legislation may be listed, if relevant). A third heading can be included to provide more specific detail (eg "J Smith Pty Limited ACN 505 505 505"). In the general text of the notice, the provision/s of the legislation (ie legislation listed in the second heading) that requires the notice to be published in the Gazette. Where the notice contains a signature, then the name of the signatory needs to be typed in the notice and not included as a scan of the signature. This also applies to any date of signing included in the notice. As Made legislation is also called annual or sessional legislation. On this site these instruments are PDFs in a static archival collection that is progressively added to as new instruments are made. The As Made legislation provided on this site consists of the following: Select the check box for the type of As Made legislation you wish to search and select whether to search in the current year or all. The default search selection is to Current year  Acts  and  Regs etc . There are two forms of searching, the most commonly used being the Standard search. The two forms of searching operate exclusively and separate search buttons are provided for that reason. (The Advanced search feature is for more specialised searching using Command Control Language. Boolean operators should not be used in the Standard search.) The Standard search has a range of pre-defined search fields that are listed below and it also enables you to search over the text or title of legislation and to limit your search to a particular year and/or a particular instrument number. Note . The search will find the documents within which your search query is located, but the search terms/s will not be highlighted in the documents. Users will need to search within the document (for example, by using  ctrl + f ) to locate the search term/s in the PDF. These fields enable you to limit your search as follows: exact phrase will find only those documents that contain those words as a phrase. all of the words will find those documents that contain all of the words that you enter in this field. any of the words will find those documents that contain any one of the words that you enter in this field. without the words will find those documents that do NOT contain the words that you enter in this field. This field is often used in combination with the other fields, for example to find documents that contain the word "offence" but not the word "imprisonment". You can enter words into all or some of the fields shown—the search will take them all into account. The search fields are not case sensitive and do not require quotation marks around words or phrases. The wildcard characters "?" (any number of characters) and "#" (exactly one character) can be used in all fields except exact phrase - see Advanced search. Search in The  "text"  and "title" selections cause the search to be applied to either the text of documents or to legislation titles. Note. A  "title"  search covers the official citations of legislation, not the titles of Chapters, Parts, Schedules etc. Limit search to year/number will apply the search to instruments assented to or made in that year, or with that instrument number. If you want more control over your searching, you can use the  Advanced Search field provided. It requires queries to be entered using the Common Command Language (CCL)—an international standard for text queries. Please note that the Search scope that you have selected with the checkboxes under the "What do you want to search over"  field DOES apply to the Advanced Search. Note also that if you type a query into the Advanced Search input field, then no other field will be taken into account, except the search scope, ie the types of legislation you chose to search over under the "What do you want to search over?"  field. CCL provides features such as: Example  jury AND district NOT sheriff Example:  fee? would match "fee","feedlots","fees" Example:  wom#n would match woman or women Example phrase query: right of appeal Note . The search will find the documents within which your search query is located, but the search terms/s will not be highlighted in the documents. Users will need to search within the document (for example, by using  ctrl + f ) to locate the search term/s in the PDF. To modify or refine your search, go back to the search screen or select search again. Your search criteria will show and can be modified and the search run again. To start a new search, click the clear button at top right on the search screen. The Bills database is a collection of NSW Bills (including Explanatory notes) at all stages of the Parliamentary process (from 1990) and of Consultation drafts of Bills publicly released before introduction (from 1999). These are static PDF documents and form a permanent archive. Bills in Parliament are organised by current Parliamentary term and then previous years, and Consultation drafts are grouped together. Select the check box for the category you wish to search. The default search is to "Bills and Explanatory notes > Current Parliament (2015  )". Searches can be made over PDFs of Bills and Explanatory notes or Consultation drafts, or both. There are two forms of searching, the most commonly used being the Standard search. The two forms of searching operate exclusively and separate search buttons are provided for that reason. (The Advanced search feature is for more specialised searching using Command Control Language. Boolean operators should not be used in the Standard search.) The Standard search has a range of pre-defined search fields that are listed below and it also enables you to search over the text or title of legislation. Note . The search will find the documents within which your search query is located, but the search terms/s will not be highlighted in the documents. Users will need to search within the document (for example, by using  ctrl + f ) to locate the search term/s in the PDF. These fields enable you to limit your search as follows: exact phrase will find only those documents that contain those words as a phrase. all of the words will find those documents that contain all of the words that you enter in this field. any of the words will find those documents that contain any one of the words that you enter in this field. without the words will find those documents that do NOT contain the words that you enter in this field. This field is often used in combination with the other fields, for example to find documents that contain the word "offence" but not the word "imprisonment". You can enter words into all or some of the fields shown—the search will take them all into account.
