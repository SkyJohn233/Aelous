A Touch of Light  Veterans suffering from PTSD stemming from both conflict and prison experiences are enrolled in A Touch of Light's art therapy program. View the work of these ex-soldiers and learn about the healing possibilities of art at this monthlong exhibit.  Closing Thursday Yadesa Bojia: Truth Be Told  Yadesa Bojia, originally from Ethiopia, became an artist when he moved to Seattle and created the winning design for the African Union flag. In this new show, Bojia applies his figurative and symbolic skills to portraits of African Americans: Local black activists, artists, writers, and professionals are painted in "mug shots." (One of them is Charles Mudede,  The Stranger 's film editor.) Instead of a name plate, each holds a placard with a description of their family relationship, profession, and passion—"mother," "father," "artist," "activist," "humanitarian." Alongside this gallery of black citizen self-assertion, which subverts the visual trappings of criminality and punishment, Bojia has juxtaposed a more expressionist series. There are figures gathered against abstract, vividly colored backgrounds and silhouettes protesting in front of enflamed cities. A saintlike person clothed in orange and yellow spreads their arms in an image crisscrossed like stained glass. Bojia seems to encompass the civic and the spiritual to reveal black humanity and resilience in the face of persecution.  Closing Thursday A Christmas Carol  ACT Theatre's production of  A Christmas Carol  is a dependable, simple pleasure, with just enough variation to warrant returning year after year.  George Balanchine's The Nutcracker  If you haven't seen this Christmas classic since you were a kid, give it a go this year. In 2015, PNB replaced its beloved Maurice Sendak set with one by Ian Falconer, who did the  Olivia the Pig  books, and I'm glad that they did. The new set is gorgeous in a Wes Anderson-y way, and it reflects the genuine weirdness and beauty in the story. I mean, the last 45 minutes of this thing is a Katy Perry video starring dancing desserts and a glittery peacock that moves like a sexy broken river. Bring a pot lozenge.  RICH SMITH Land of the Sweets: The Burlesque Nutcracker  The 12th annual  Land of the Sweets: The Burlesque Nutcracker  is a lascivious holiday show experience with sugar plum fairies, exciting, clothes-dropping times, and who knows, maybe some "woody" jokes.  Kat Larson  In Kat Larson's latest photo/video series, she continues the story of an alien from another planet who crash lands on Earth. As the visitor explores the planet, they find their strength weakened by a lack of love and compassion, and begin to slowly fade away.  Closing Friday Wonderland  Wonderland returns! Can Can will transform its venue into a snowy chalet and populate it with teasing beauties. VIP tickets get you champagne and a meal as well. There's also a  brunch show  that's safe for kids, and there will be a special  New Year's Eve performance . Gazelle Samizay: My shadow is a word writing itself across time  This exhibition by Gazelle Samizay embodies the fear of oppression that still haunts ethnic minorities in the United States. The Kabul-born artist journeyed to Manzanar, California, the site of the biggest Japanese internet camp, and her photo exhibit explores the space, its history of exploitation and cruelty, and its natural geography, which to Samizay is reminiscent of that of her native Afghanistan.  Closing Sunday Hana Hamplová: Meditations on Paper  Bohumil Hrabal's novella  Too Loud a Solitude , about a paper crusher who saves morsels of the books he must destroy, was published in samizdat form in repressive 1970s communist Czechoslovakia. The photographer Hana Hamplová was chosen to take the cover photo, and she explored the recycling centers of Prague as she sought the perfect image. These delicate photographs, hanging at the Frye until December 31, investigate the physical properties of paper—some pages curve like canyons, others lie bound in striated rows or are caught in the first stages of disintegration. They're cheap, flimsy, and easy to discard, but consider that you can still bear witness to long-destroyed paper in images for a 1976 book written under an oppressive regime. Manuscripts may burn, but culture is harder to kill.  JOULE ZELMAN Closing Sunday Kyle Johnson: Seeking the Mongolian Taimen  Kyle Johnson's photos document the efforts to save the Mongolian taimen, a species related to salmon and trout that can live to over 50 and attain weights of 200 pounds.  Closing Sunday Manuel Álvarez Bravo: Mexico's Poet of Light  See 23 photographs by renowned Mexican photographer Manuel Álvarez Bravo, who is known for his seven-decade career capturing—among many other themes—urban life, the nude form, folk art, and the work of muralists including Diego Rivera. Many of Bravo's images come across as anthropological photojournalism, and others focus closely on texture and shadows, zooming in to create abstract, sometimes surreal mini-scenes removed from culture and politics. This exhibit will feature images that "show the artist's ability to synthesize motifs of Mexican religious and indigenous works and plant forms (such as agave leaves) with a Modernist approach to image making."  Closing Sunday Mike Kelley: Day Is Done  Mike Kelley was a highly regarded artist known for using video, performance, drawing, found objects, textiles, sound, and site-specific installation to investigate the relationship between popular culture and the American subconscious before his untimely death in 2012. Created in 2005,  Day Is Done  is an ambitious, overwhelming musical-film installation in 32 chapters that uses "extracurricular activities" culled from hundreds of high-school yearbooks as a point of departure to illuminate the dark contours of adolescence, concealed trauma, and memory through evidence of personal and institutional ritual.  EMILY POTHAST Closing Sunday Selections from the Anne Gould Hauberg Collection  In 2016, Jen Graves wrote, "Anne Gould Hauberg, the arts patron who knew how to crack a joke and command a room, and who also had one of those exquisite Matisse drawings facing her when she sat on her couch at home, died Monday at age 98. I liked her very much. She was no stuffy snob. She was a whip. She is already very missed." Hauberg co-founded the Pilchuck Glass School and was known for her incredible art collection—at this exhibit, see a selection of the works she amassed.  Closing Sunday Walter Quirt: A Science of Life  You can find the works of this American modernist in the Whitney, the MoMA, the deYoung Museum, and many other prestigious institutions—but many of the particular drawings and paintings now at Frederick Holmes haven't been seen in half a century.  Closing Sunday Holiday Tea in the Fireside Room  Instead of gazing at a virtual Yule log video, take your tea beside a real roaring, crackling hearth at Hotel Sorrento’s Fireside Room, a  Mad Men –worthy mid-century vision in opulent ochre mahogany paneling. You can nosh on posh teatime fare—like freshly baked chocolate-filled croissants with butter and jam, cucumber and cream-cheese finger sandwiches, and chocolate espresso pots de creme with strawberries—as you sink into a squishy high-backed leather chair and enjoy the sounds of a baby grand piano. If you’re lucky, you might even spy the ghost of Alice B. Toklas, who is said to roam the halls of the hotel. Dina Martina Christmas Show  Do you appreciate irony? Do you enjoy joy? Are you a sucker for horrifying stories told as if they’re heartwarming, the spectacle of beastly narcissism among the untalented, and pop songs with the lyrics rewritten because the singer seems to have undergone some kind of brain scramble? The Seattle holiday tradition of the drag-gone-wrong  Dina Martina Christmas Show  is upon us. All we know for sure is that one song she sings every year will be in it. I wouldn’t miss it for the world.  CHRISTOPHER FRIZZELLE Irving Berlin's Holiday Inn  A musical based on the film by Gordon Greenburg and Chad Hodge, it features songs by Irving Berlin such as "White Christmas" and "Easter Parade." It's going to be the 5th's holiday show, directed by David Armstrong and choreographed by James Rocco.  CHRISTOPHER FRIZZELLE Love, Chaos, and Dinner  Beloved circus/cabaret/comedy institution Teatro ZinZanni will return to Seattle for a dinner theater production of  Love, Chaos, and Dinner . They promise "the same stunning, velvet-laden, and iconic Belgian spiegeltent Seattleites will remember from Teatro ZinZanni’s former location on lower Queen Anne." The cast is led by first-time "Madame ZinZanni" Ariana Savalas, and will feature a duo on aerial trapeze, a magician, a "contortionist-puppet," a yodeling dominatrix, a hoop aerialist, and a Parisian acrobat.  Gingerbread Village  This gingerbread village is no joke: Every year, Seattle architecture firms, master builders, and Sheraton Seattle culinary teams come together to build a meticulously planned candy wonderland. The theme of this year's village is "25 Years of Cheer: A Celebration of Seattle." See elements of the city's past and its imagined future in candy form, from skyscrapers to underground tunnels.  WildLights  See the zoo in a new light—500,000 energy-efficient LEDs, in fact! See luminous animal-themed designs, have an indoor snowball fight, meet Santa and his very real reindeer and some nocturnal animals, listen to carolers, and enjoy the holiday beer garden.  Science in the City: Undiscovered America  Earlier this month, the president shrank the size of two national monuments in Utah by more than a million acres. In the eyes of Republicans and the fossil-fuel industry, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase–Escalante are not sites of natural wonder, sacred burial, and archeological discovery, but rather treasure chests waiting to be plundered and transformed into emissions and their own retirement plans. At this lecture, landscape photographer Zack Frank will present his gorgeous photo series of lesser-known national monuments and parks that are also vulnerable to the whims of the current administration. He'll be around after the talk to answer any of your questions about the threat to public lands in the coming years.  RICH SMITH Seattle7Writers' Book Club with Garth Stein Reading 'The Mothers'  Join Garth Stein, author of  The Art of Racing in the Rain , for a discussion of  The Mothers  by Brit Bennett. While you're there, sip drink specials from Raconteur and take 20 percent off the book.  Howl’s Moving Castle  I liked everything about the idea of  Howl's Moving Castle, A New Musical, . Sara Porkalob is the star. She's a quadruple threat who can carry a show on her own, but in this production she has the help of Michael Feldman, Randall Scott Carpenter, Kate Jaeger, and Opal Peachey. How could anything go wrong? Hayao Miyazaki transformed Diana Wynne Jones's 1986 novel into a beloved and mesmerizing anime with a celebrated soundtrack, and there's no reason why director/adapter/Book-It co-founder Myra Platt and composer/lyricist/actor/musician Justin Huertas couldn't turn the same source material into a magical musical. Huertas's humor and Platt's experience boded well, and there seemed to be plenty of opportunity to buck the conventions of generic musical theater and run with something a little wilder. I liked the poster. But, though the performances were generally fantastic, this production couldn't overcome the big problem presented by the story of  Howl's Moving Castle . It's boring. ALL THAT SAID: Platt does retain a lot of the gender and age fluidity that makes Jones's novel interesting to think about for more than 15 minutes, and that combined with her decision to scrap Sophie's happily-ever-after ending ingeniously (if indirectly) made room for characters and designers to make choices they wouldn't have been able to make.  RICH SMITH Julie Alpert and Andy Arkley: Desert Daze  The husband-and-wife team of Julie Alpert and Andy Arkley collaborates on installations that mix pools and splashes of bright colors, icons, patterns, found objects, and trompe l'oeil sculpture. In  Desert Daze , originally crafted at the Roswell Artist in Residence Program, cardboard tapestries and paper shapes are plastered to the walls or suspended in the air, so that shadow, string, and empty space add to the visual play. Art is not just an object to be contemplated but an invitation to let your curiosity lead you through countless possible trajectories.  JOULE ZELMAN Closing Saturday Tech Support  How can Seattle artists appeal to the affluent newcomers in the tech sector? This is a question I see a lot of artists and gallerists posing lately, and it seems to be an anxiety underlying  Tech Support , a group exhibition curated by Colleen RJC Bratton aimed at bridging the gap between Seattle's art and tech scenes. Formatted like a quasi-store that sells tech-based art objects,  Tech Support  features an outstanding roster of artists including Dakota Gearhart, Jason Hirata, Sol Hashimi, Francisco Guerrero, and Ellen Jing Xu.  EMILY POTHAST Closing Saturday Homo for the Holidays  This annual drag and burlesque gigglefest features a bunch of wacky little holiday-themed skits that our own Dan Savage once called "FUCKING GREAT… FUCKING HILARIOUS!" DeLouRue, aka Kitten 'n Lou and BenDeLaCreme, bring you a special with Cherdonna, Waxie Moon, and other superqueer stars.  A Drag Queen Christmas  Hosted by  RuPaul's Drag Race  Season 9 contestant Trinity Taylor, this holiday spectacular boasts performances by all your Drag Race favorites, like Season 9 winner Sasha Velour, runners-up Shea Coulee and Aja, Season 4 contestant Latrice Royale, Season 6 alum Milk, and Season 8's Chi Chi DeVayne.  Snowflakes  Sandbox Radio's  Snowflakes  retro-engineers a radio show with live sound effects accompanying plays, poetry, and comedy, all recorded before your very eyes.  Coco Montrese  Coco Montrese is a lip-synch assassin. But don't be fooled, she didn't catapult into the  RuPaul's Drag Race  Hall of Fame because of her agile lips. She's famous because she "stole" the Miss Gay America 2010 crown from Alyssa Edwards. It's the stuff of  Showgirls  and is delightfully catty. Montrese is booked for three nights at the controversial new gay bar Queer/Bar over New Year's. You should go, but you should absolutely NOT pay $500 for the VIP "premier" table for four at the  Sin City NYE Party  (where she'll perform along with other  Drag Race  stars). Only straight people deserve to pay that much for drag—and, straighties, that money is better spent on local talent.  CHASE BURNS The Gay Uncle's Journey Through the Valley of the Dolls  The Gay Uncle Time was, according to  Stranger  contributor Matt Baume, "an avuncular variety show starring Santa-esque comedian Jeffrey Robert and a rotating cavalcade of local stars, drag queens, storytellers, and weirdos," which gives a "healthy dose of history, comedy, and song from the gay uncle you always wished you had and his friends you always suspected were up to no good." In this new iteration, he promises to start with Jacqueline Susann's "CLASSIC of Trash Literature" and tear through such topics as "ankhs, Judy Garland, barbiturates, Dory Previn, backstage drama, Charles Manson, breast cancer, poodles, wig fights, Russ Meyer, Patty Duke, and so much more."  Talisman  &  Entelechy  This show at Seattle's most occult art gallery includes prints, art books, and "paper vestments" by press owners William Kiesel (Ouroboros Press) and Catherine Alice Michaelis (May Day Press). In their joint exhibition, the two friends and former colleagues celebrate their "parallel journeys integrating the left and right hand paths."  Closing Sunday Everyone's $50  For the past three years, the Alice has invited everyone to participate in its December art exhibition, whether or not they consider themselves "artists." This year's take on the annual tradition includes exactly 100 works priced at $50 each. It's a beautifully hung show, with art by C.M. Ruiz, Brandon Vosika, Nadia Ahmed, Travis Ritter, Yabsira Alemeshet Wolde, Alex Kang, Khadija Ann Tarver, Phillipe Hyojung Kim, and many more (92 to be exact). All proceeds are split 50/50 between the artist and the gallery, which means that not only is it a great place to find affordable art for gifting, it's a nice way to support both artists and one of the smartest, most forward-thinking galleries in town.  EMILY POTHAST Forever 22+  The Specialist's holiday show includes work by Colleen RJC Bratton, Mel Carter, Dawn Cerny, Ryna Frankel, Erin Gigl, and many prominent local artists.  MarchFourth, the Fungineers, DJ CobraWolfShark  The vivacious, extravagantly bizarre MarchFourth is a performance troupe that hails from Portland and features 15 or so members that encompass a full band (bassist, guitarist, percussion corps, brass section) along with fire-eaters, stilt walkers, burlesque dancers, and acrobats. Clad in bedazzled, repurposed marching-band-themed costumes given a burlesque-meets-vaudeville-meets-circus-tent twist (think lots of black-and-white stripes, gold buttons and sequins, feathers, and flamboyant head pieces), MarchFourth delivers a high-spirited, intoxicating mix of indulgent theatrics and musical mastery, their sound dousing New Orleans–style marching band brass with elements of hard rock, funk, gypsy jazz, Afrobeat, and even some Latin music. All together, it makes for one wildly eclectic stage show that is far from novelty and definitely worth checking out.     LEILANI POLK West End Girls: A Drag Extravaganza!  People have been able to get a beer and tater tots in West Seattle, well, forever, but now they can do it while watching a drag queen lip-synch a Marilyn Manson song. Or lip-synch Panda Bear while dressed as a sea monster. Or smack a Chipotle burrito against her tuck. It's hard to say what will happen at West End Girls, featuring "queens  &  kings from all over the Northwest."  CHASE BURNS Chihuly NYE pARTy  Choose this New Year's Eve party if you want to watch fireworks through the glass ceiling, tour the glass museum, hear live music by the Michael Benson Band, and drink a champagne toast at midnight (and if you've got 250 clams to throw around). Dale Chihuly's wriggly, organic-looking glass sculptures will surely be dazzling by firework-light.  Xtreme Theatresports New Year's Eve Party  Unexpected Productions will pit four improv teams against one another at their New Year's celebration—and you will score each contestant group's efforts. You and your fellow audience members determine the last winners of 2017. Complete with giveaways, party favors, a ball drop, and a champagne toast.  First Night Tacoma  Kick off the New Year with Seattle's smaller, more manageable neighbor town's 25th annual all-ages festival. "The world's shortest parade" will start the festivities at 6:30, followed by dancing, music, and other performances on "over a dozen" stages, and the evening will wind up with fireworks at 11:30.  The Room NYE in 10D!  What more appropriate way to end this year than with the famously stilted, poorly written, outlandishly delivered cinematic calamity known as  The Room ? Central Cinema promises a gateway to the "10 Dimensions" of Tommy Wiseau's creation, including "Height, Width, (Emotional) Depth, Time, Taste, The Ability To See Dead People, Love, Greg Sestero, The Ability To Talk To Doggies In Flower Shops, and Spoons."  Anchovies  &  Olives New Year's Eve 2017  Spend the last hours of the year enjoying a five-course dinner at Anchovies  &  Olives. Start with crudo, salads, and foie gras before diving into a spot prawn paccari, black cod, and Snake River Farms New York steak. They're also offering add-ons like a wine pairing or a bubbly starter of three oysters and a glass of Prosecco.  Baller Beer  &  Bubbles: New Year's Eve Dinner  There’s the phrase “champagne taste on a beer budget,” but as the GIF says, why don’t we have both? Belltown’s James Beard Award–nominated “weird beer and good food” bar No Anchor highlights upscale sparklers and tasty suds alike on their high-low New Year’s Eve dinner menu, with a roster of rare and unusual craft brews and “dope natural bubbles” poured alongside luxuriously snackable bites like smoked trout and foie gras on crackers.  Bateau New Year's Eve 2017  The Bateau crew will be serving up a special four-course prix fixe dinner for New Year's Eve.  Countdown at the Bayou  If the holiday’s glut of prohibition-themed parties doesn’t appeal to you, transport yourself instead to the balmy Bayou with Capitol Cider’s French Creole fête, hosted by drag queen Tipsy Rose Lee. Wash hushpuppies and beignets down with crisp sparkling cider as you take in a burlesque performance from “bluestocking bettie” Jesse Belle-Jones and live music from psych-rockers General Mojo’s. There will also be a magician and psychic readings to add some enchantment to your evening.  Junebaby New Year's Eve 2017  Junebaby has been named the best restaurant of the year in the nation by Eater, so what better way to ring in 2018 than by partaking in their four-course tasting menu featuring fried chicken and their beverage pairing?  Midnight: A NYE Dance Party  As you would expect, the city’s most exclusive restaurant is sparing no expense for their end-of-2017 shindig, which has been in the works since March and which harks back to Canlis’s mid-century roots with a glamorous suggested dress code of 1950s sequins. They’re flying in the Chris Norton Band from New York to perform, transforming the upstairs into a Dick’s Drive-In, and have been tight-lipped on details, as they promise a parade of surprises throughout the night of “dancing, libations, and nosh.” Though New Year’s Eve is typically their most profitable night of the year, they’re admirably donating every last dime of the proceeds to local charity Big Table, which "exists to see the lives of those working in the restaurant and hospitality industry transformed by building community around shared meals and caring for those in crisis, transition, or falling through the cracks."  Moët  &  Chandon New Year's Eve Bash  Seattle restaurateur Ethan Stowell is throwing a lavish bash with two seatings at his elegant Goldfinch Tavern at the Four Seasons Hotel. Chef Joe Ritchie's locally sourced five-course prix-fixe meal features a selection of oysters, crudo, crab, wild mushroom gnocchi, lobster, rabbit, and Wagyu beef, just to name a few. For the second seating, DJ Nelson Estrada will step in to provide music, capped off with a Moët  &  Chandon champagne toast when the clock strikes midnight.  New Year's Eve at Eden Hill  James Beard Award–nominated chef Maximillian Petty of Eden Hill is known for his playful and imaginative creations: a foie gras “cake batter,” a pig head candy bar, kettle corn brussels sprouts. He’s sure to bring that same sense of whimsy and innovation to his decadent five-course New Year’s Eve prix-fixe menu, which begins with a Marcona almond tartlet with fresh ricotta made in-house that afternoon and ends with a dark-chocolate ball drop that you can eat just before the Times Square ball drops.   New Year's Eve at Tarsan i Jane  Tarsan i Jane's decadent New Year's Eve dinner includes lobster, sea urchin, and wild venison. Guests have the option of supplementing their meal with a beverage pairing, flower bouquet, Royal Ossetra/Sturgeon Caviar, 5J Iberico de Bellota (cured ham), and/or carabinero (deep-sea prawn) for additional fees.  Salare New Year's Eve 2017  Acclaimed chef Edouardo Jordan offers a seven-course chef tasting menu with wine pairings.  Staple  &  Fancy New Year's Eve 2017  This four-course supper begins with a smattering of plates for the whole table, followed by gnocchi with smoked mussels and saffron crema; seared sea scallops with cauliflower, chickpea fritters, blood orange, and kohlrabi; and grilled New York strip loin with Cippolini onion, red wine sauce, and parsnip mash. If you still have room for dessert, they'll have a Dulcey chocolate cremeux, cheesecake with honey glazed kumquats, and Champagne sorbet (!).  The Herbfarm New Year's Eve Gala  Welcome in the new year with an extravagant dinner celebration at the Northwest's "original farm-to-table restaurant." The evening offers live music, festive décor, and a variety of wines.  Toshikoshi Soba  In Japan, eating toshikoshi soba (“year-passing noodles”) on New Year’s Eve is thought to impart longevity and prosperity, in part because of soba’s association with the marvelously resilient buckwheat plant and in part because it’s believed that the noodles, which are easily cut, aid in severing the hardship of the previous year. You can test this theory for yourself with Kamonegi’s soba noodles, made meticulously by hand with buckwheat ground in-house. Their efficacy is said to be proportional to how delicious they are, so know that you’ll be in good hands: Chef and owner Mutsuko Soma was just declared the 2017 Seattle chef of the year by both Eater and its readers.  Indulgence  At "Seattle's biggest New Year's Eve bash," you can explore MoPOP, check out a comedy stage, get drunk, and even hear music by '80s party rock groups Hairstorm and Brand X. If you haven't brought anybody to smooch, check out the Singles Mingle and you may be mashing lips by midnight. The VIP Gold pass lets you avoid lines, eat special snacks, and use a private restroom so you don't have to pee with the proles.  Nordic New Year's Eve  The Swedish Cultural Center invites you to a night of local and Scandinavian music with three floors of dancing to the tunes of Rat City Brass, Buttdial, and the Disco Cowboys. Champagne, favors, Swedish ginger snaps, and a view of the fireworks included. For $50, enjoy an authentic Scandinavian feast crafted by Swedish chef Erik Johansson.  SPECTRA: New Year’s Eve Under the Arches  You don't need to be a nerd to enjoy this opulent party at the museum, as long as you have a healthy appreciation for midnight fireworks—but it'll be best if you're a fan of science, the Laser Dome, drinking, dancing, and KEXP DJs. At midnight, watch the happy explosions from their nifty be-sculptured courtyard. VIPs get access to an open bar, snacks and desserts, a private lounge, champagne, and more.  BeautyBoiz Wear Masks NYE  Your big queer New Year's Eve party will have so much to offer, courtesy of Forward Flux Productions: drag by Crystal Powers, Adé, and Haus of Shade, masquerade frolics, a champagne toast, aerial performances, a full bar, and sets by celebrated local disc jockey icons Cookie Couture and Reverend Dollars. Dress skimpily or extravagantly, but be sure to wear your best mask. VIP tickets include a special entrance, coat check, unlimited champagne, and a meet and greet with Crystal Powers.  Moisture Festival New Year's Eve Extravaganza  Moisture Festival is devoted to the variety of performers Seattle has fostered over the years, from circus acts to comedians, burlesque dancers to musicians, and jugglers to tap dancers. It's been going for more than 13 years in Seattle, a testament to the popularity of cabaret-style entertainment in town. At this New Year's spectacular, Esther de Monteflores, Godfrey Daniels, Lamonte  &  The Family Affair, Patrick McGuire, Ron W. Bailey, and Tom Noddy will wow you with funk, juggling, aerial acts, and more entertainment. Plus, giant red balloons and snacks and champagne!
