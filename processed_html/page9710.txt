Sleepman monitors sleep, fatigue and will keep you safe on the road Sleepman, which haas just hit Kickstarter, could be the ultimate wearable for sleep if it delivers on all of its promises. Like most  fitness trackers  it will monitor sleep patterns, but it also claims to improve sleep quality and alert drivers if they need to take a rest. The wellness device uses Electro-Dermal Activity (EDA) sensors that are able to collect electromagnetic bio-signals 24/7. Along with with signal tracking algorithms that developers Avantechs says have been throughly tested for two decades, it is able to analyse sleep and activity levels to record sleep patterns and help wake you up during the correct sleep phase. Read this :  Sleep monitoring explained The likes of  Jawbone and Fitbit  use movement based monitoring, which isn't regarded as the most accurate way to track sleep. So the ability to be more in tune with the brain's activity should be a more reliable solution. But there's more. Sleepman also includes a Doze-Off Alert that aims to warn drivers of the earliest sign of concentration loss, and can help you have the perfect power nap by waking you up before you fall into a deep sleep. Extra features can be added to the wearable with additional accessories, which include a heart rate monitor, a panic alarm, and something called a InsomniZap to help users fall asleep faster. The Sleepman is currently trying to raise $50,000 on  Kickstarter  and is steadily moving towards the halfway point with plenty of days left to run on the campaign. $99 will get you one when it ships in November 2016, which is considerably cheaper than the $250 retail price. â€‹
