push about push me our vision is audaciously ambitious we want to use the space to amplify the impact of the artists this has the power to change the way in which disability and creativity are viewed throughout the cultural sector so go on push me push me was one of the first 53 digital arts commissions for the space a collaboration led by watershed it provided an invitation into the journey of 12 artists working as part of unlimited the cultural olympiad programme focusing on disability push me profiled the journey of 12 artists creating the unlimited commissions susan austin rachel gadsden claire cunningham jez colborne and mind the gap ramesh meyyappan bobby baker mish weaver and stumble caroline bowditch graeae laurence clark simon mckeown and janice parker we called the project push me as we were interested in the whole idea of the artists going beyond something they had done before pushing past what they had previously achieved so push me was about the artists pushing themselves but it was also about more than that we were interested in how the work that they created is challenging and changing the arts sector as the artists grow and develop how do others have to grow and develop too the team behind push me was part of the push too pushing each other to look at things differently and gain new skills so what exactly have we done we have created a series of 90 second films push me for 90 seconds that have been dropped into the space from june 2012 supported here by a blog to keep people up to date with information about their inspirations the commissions themselves and the impact they are having out in the wide wide world in september 2012 we filmed a 30 minute documentary looking at the work that was showcased at the unlimited festival at the southbank part of the london 2012 festival and this too was placed into the space as a 30 minute documentary total permission it has also had the following live screening bbc big screens showed push
