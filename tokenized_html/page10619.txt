media about us organization key officials congressional budget opportunities doing business emergency management survey manual no neither the usgs nor any other scientists have ever predicted a major earthquake we do not know how and we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future usgs scientists can only calculate the probability that a significant earthquake will occur in a specific area within a certain number of years an earthquake prediction must define 3 elements 1 the date and time 2 the location and 3 the magnitude yes some people say they can predict earthquakes but here are the reasons why their statements are false if an earthquake happens to occur that remotely fits their prediction they claim success even though 1-3 of the predicted elements is wildly different from what occurred therefore a failed prediction predictions by non-scientists usually start swirling around social media when something happens that is thought to be a precursor to an earthquake in the near future the so-called precursor is often a swarm of small earthquakes increasing amounts of radon in local water unusual behavior of animals increasing size of magnitudes in moderate size events or a moderate-magnitude event rare enough to suggest that it may be a foreshock unfortunately most such precursors frequently occur without being followed by an earthquake so a real prediction is not possible instead if there is a scientific basis a forecast may be made in probabilistic terms to learn what a probability is and how they work see the faq under seismic hazardsmaps probabilities and eq engineering are earthquake probabilities or forecasts the same as prediction an earthquake forecast was made in china several decades ago based on small earthquakes and unusual animal activity many people chose to sleep outside of their homes and thus were spared when the main earthquake indeed occurred and caused widespread destruction however usually no large earthquake follows this type of seismic activity and unfortunately many earthquakes are preceded by no precursory events whatsoever the next large chinese event was entirely unheralded and scores of thousands of chinese died the usgs focuses its efforts on the long-term mitigation of earthquake hazards by helping to improve the safety of structures rather than by trying to accomplish short-term predictions learn more this report prepared for the national earthquake prediction evaluation council nepec is intended as a step toward improving communications about earthquake hazards between information providers and users who coordinate emergency-response activities in the cascadia region of the pacific northwest nepec charged a subcommittee of scientists with several recently published reports have suggested that semi-stationary linear-cloud formations might be causally precursory to earthquakes we examine the report of guangmeng and jie 2013 who claim to have predicted the 2012 m 6.0 earthquake in the po valley of northern italy after seeing a satellite photograph a digital image the seismological laboratory at the california institute of techonology caltech was founded in 1928 as a result of a study by the carnegie institue of washington the study was based primarily on a 1916 report by h. o wood which recommended that a network of seismic stations be established in southern california in 1929 the carnegie advisory in an article in the last issue of the earthquake information bulletin earthquakes and plate tectonics by henry spall we saw how 90 percent of the world 's earthquakes occur at the margins of the earth 's major crustal plates however when we look at the distribution of earthquakes in detail we see that a number of nearly aseismic regions new
