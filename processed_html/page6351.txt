Sharelatex with texlive and special fonts - TeX - LaTeX Stack Exchange                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 I installed the docker image of sharelatex community edition and installed texlive scheme-full with the tlmgr command within the docker container. When I try to compile one of my projects, there is an error: It is not only with the ifsym font but with all fonts I am using e.g. If I use find to look if the files exist, I get following output. Looks like everything exists - so I don't know what I am doing wrong here. Does anyone have an idea what I can do? PS: If I install texlive-full via apt-get command, everything works fine - problem with this is the distribution packages are from 2013. Ok, if anyone stumbles over this. The docker image for sharelatex is missing one essential line. /var/www/sharelatex is the home dir of the sharelatex user and if latex tries to compile with temporary files (e.g. mktexpk for fonts) it fails because it cannot write in its home directory.
