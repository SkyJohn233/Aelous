Multiplayer Lag/Lost Connection ( self.aoe2 ) submitted 3 years ago by Migtuga Today I tried playing online with a friend of mine, since we had just gotten the African Kingdoms expansion, but when we started the match, it only lasted a couple of seconds before it crashed (lost connection), and while it didnt crash it lagged a lot.  We were both on the same team against 2 AI opponents, and the unit limit was set to 500. Since some sources online said it could be due to the AI, we tried a 1v1 match but it still didn ' t work. We both have good internet connections, and when I pinged him i got a response in 14ms. Is there any way to fix this? Post a comment! [–] SeaSquirrel 2 points 3 points 4 points 3 years ago (0 children) lag issues are still trying to get fixed. maybe try again. [–] Icagel 3 points 4 points 5 points 3 years ago * (3 children) I don ' t know the exact  " why "  but these things surely don ' t help: High unit limit 4.4 makes game far more unstable (they ' re everyday working on it though!) some of these are related to AoAK, so it could have something to do. Any specific thing you did when it crashed? That ' s all I can think of, you might want to play again, saving the replay (see if watching the replay crashes your game as well! some people have that issue, important to notice IMO) and send that to the devs, you might have that problem fixed by next week with the constant fixes they ' re relasing.Try playing (separately) with other players, in both original and expansion modes and see if this happens always everytime for both of you. Might help detect what ' s/who ' s causing the issue. Edit: Also, keep in mind that even though this game is P2P it stills goes through steam before that (unnecessary IMO but well, that ' s how it is), so if Steam was collapsed at that point might have caused issues (it is pretty much collapsed these days, remember FO4 came out!)  [–] Migtuga [ S ] 1 point 2 points 3 points 3 years ago * (2 children) I would like to point out the game itself didn ' t crash. I meant the connection  " crashed " , saying I had lost connection to my friend. It happened everytime we tried playing together, both against the AI and against eachother. I ' ll try playing without the expansion/with a smaller unit limit tomorrow and see if it helps. Anyway, thank you very much for your answer. [–] Icagel 1 point 2 points 3 points 3 years ago (1 child) Oh sorry, misread that part, long long day don ' t blame me :PAlso keep in mind that both of you should play with other players to see if you lose connection that way! Maybe it ' s that either of you have, like blocked ports or, dunno, something like that. [–] Migtuga [ S ] 1 point 2 points 3 points 3 years ago (0 children) Well, we tried it again today with a normal sized map (500 max pop.) against 2 AI (still with African Kingdoms factions) and it worked. It lagged a little in the beggining but later was a lot smoother. I guess it was either the map size or Steam ' s fault. Anyway, thanks for the help! [–] RageComicer113 1 point 2 points 3 points 3 years ago (6 children) Aoe2hd or on voobly?   [–] Migtuga [ S ] 1 point 2 points 3 points 3 years ago (4 children) Age of Empires 2 HD. What ' s voobly? [–] leakyboat2 2 points 3 points 4 points 3 years ago (3 children) Voobly is another hosting site.  It only has AOC, none of the other expansions.   As far as the lag goes, 500 pop will always lag but it should not cause you a problem in the early game.  I would suggest trying again, it is possible that steam was just slow the day you tried to play?  I do not have much problem with lag in HD as long as pings are good and it is 3v3 or less with 200 pop. Also, if you are playing giant or Ludakris map it will lag.  [–] Migtuga [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 3 years ago (2 children) I ' ll give it a try then, thank you for your input. Do you know if they ' ll ever  " fix "  this issue? [–] norther_ 2 points 3 points 4 points 3 years ago (1 child) It ' s been a problem since original release more than 2 years ago. Pretty safe to say it ' s never gonna get fixed. [–] Migtuga [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 3 years ago (0 children) Well, thats a shame. They could at least add LAN though. [–] [deleted] 0 points 1 point 2 points 3 years ago (0 children) Also African Kingdoms isn ' t available on Voobly. Posts are automatically archived after 6 months.
