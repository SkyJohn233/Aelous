horse piss beer ruth e. hendricks photography ruth e. hendricks photography there- i put it right in the title horse piss beer- so there are no surprises about the photo of the day i try to keep things family friendly on the blog but this is about family my son mark is on business in kentucky and sent me this on the phone tonight he s near lexington i love when my family sends me a photo and says for the blog and the other reason i m posting- my dad always told us that beer tasted like horse piss i think that was to make us not want to drink it now he was born in 1912 in farmersville illinois and grew up on a farm that included horses but i doubt he actually tasted the urine from any horse my parents didn t drink but my father s father surely did and that is why my dad did not so maybe he knew what he was talking about the taste was like the scent one of the reviews of the beer said it smells like tomatoes this is not an endorsement for drinking this golden colored brew i went and read a few reviews and am not seeking a sample but their website states horse piss beer is dedicated to helping others a percentage of the sales of the beer and merchandise will be donated to help disabled jockeys and adoption programs for our equine friends my father and his warnings about the taste of beer made me feel my dad was sending me a message with mark s photo seriously and so i share it with you and a photo i took in a backyard at a birthday party almost two weeks ago thanks bj and t enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email join 4,957 other subscribers email address sign me up
