Xbox 5 5 User Rating: 5 out of 5 Thank You XBOX!!!!!!!!! Xbox 5 5 User Rating: 5 out of 5 Memories are priceless! Xbox 4 5 User Rating: 4 out of 5 One of my favorite games when i first got my Xbox 360 glad to see it on Xbox one üëç Xbox 5 5 User Rating: 5 out of 5 Who else craves that nostalgia? :) Xbox 5 5 User Rating: 5 out of 5 Fantastic game, and still holds up so well. Grateful to see it on back-compat. Xbox 5 5 User Rating: 5 out of 5 This is how these open world gang games should be made. This still looks great even after all these years. 5*  Xbox 5 5 User Rating: 5 out of 5 I got this game in 2006, got 100% completion, but can &# x27;t use my save because of lost DLC. I don &# x27;t see anything in my Ready to Install or on the See in Microsoft Store. Really upsetting but still an AMAZING game. I guess I &# x27;ll start over üòí Still highly recommended. 5 stars easy. My problem is with Xbox, not the game. This game is beautiful. Definitely got killed when SR3 and 4 got released. Hope this helps anyone, even if you got the free packs, you wont be able to use your saves unfortunatelyUPDATE: THEY ADDED DLC TO THE MARKET...For anyone that knows how hard this is, I just did every activity up to level 8  &  completed it before doing the first stronghold (third mission). Was going to do a 100% run again, but I got my completion save and now a save with 43 hours on it with everything done except the campaign. IF YOU NEED HELP, HMU! I &# x27;m 100%ing this game twice now. I already did SR2 and SR3, so 4 is next, R.I.P. Xbox 4 5 User Rating: 4 out of 5 When SR3 was offered on Games with Gold, I gave it a try.  I liked it enough that I bought the first two games.  Since then, I &# x27;ve logged more hours in SR than SR3, SR4 and Gat Out of Hell combined (ditto for SR2).This game has (IMO) the best story/campaign out of all the games.  My only complaint is some stupidity with the driving controls (which was fixed in SR2) that made the last Rollerz mission extremely frustrating, and the inability to fine aim (which was also fixed in SR2).  Well, that and the lack of multiplayer co-op in the campaign (which was ALSO also fixed in SR2).  If the driving controls had been done better, and the ability to actually aim your weapons had been included, I &# x27;d gladly give this game 5 stars.It &# x27;s got drama, comedy, action and intrigue.  It &# x27;s got a silent protagonist as well as truly memorable supporting characters and villains who deliver some of the best (and most quotable) dialogue I &# x27;ve heard in a video game, done by some really talented actors. Xbox 5 5 User Rating: 5 out of 5 The story was good even though you have a silent protagonist. The multiplayer had a variety of game modes that kept you from playing the sequels. I hope people are still playing this after 12 years.
