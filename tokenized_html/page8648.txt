everything 🙄 – z4k187 4 points 5 points 6 points 1 year ago 0 children the studio doesn t decide the number of episodes how many times does this have to be repeated here in this sub – lostinthevoid_

sadly i think they will focus on that – _kingcrimson_ 3 points 4 points 5 points 1 year ago 0 children funnily enough they rush the action scenes too – hasnain1720 10 points 11 points 12 points 1 year ago 0 children can t say im surprised lol – dixwins 10 points 11 points 12 points 1 year ago 0 children well maybe this would work if they had 40 mins allocated per episode – wintersoldier16 16 points 17 points 18 points 1 year ago 0 children well that effectively killed any hype i had for the anime urgh – bradythenarwhal 6 points 7 points 8 points 1 year ago 0 children feelsbadman – proteusxiii 5 points 6 points 7 points 1 year ago 1 child tf the opening makes it seem like they re planning on covering up to the tsukiyama arc just how much are they going to cut to be able to that – masteradventzero s 4 points 5 points 6 points 1 year ago 0 children seeing that it s adapting 5 volumes ..a lot of content not surprisingly – sezyfazes 5 points 6 points 7 points 1 year ago 1 child i

points 1 year ago 0 children this isn t surprising whatsoever in fact doesn t even feel like news – adri0907 12 points 13 points 14 points 1 year ago 1 child they haven t understood yet that more than twelve episodes are required to adapt well all the stuff and emotions tokyo ghoul re provides it looks obvious isn t it tokyo ghoul re anime could be a real masterpiece and pierrot studio will surely ruin it – naijaboy18 8 points 9 points 10 points 1 year ago 0 children and once again people don t realize that it s the tv networks and manga publishers such as shueisha are the ones that decide whether it s 12 or 24 episodes unless it s an original in-house anime studios don t have as much say as people think – wahab12 9 points 10 points 11 points 1 year ago 0 children im crying rn – phat_retard445 11 points 12 points 13 points 1 year ago 2 children chap 125 animated is all i want – masteradventzero s 3 points 4 points 5 points 1 year ago 1 child i doubt they ll do that – marinprofesorpreda 20 points 21 points 22 points 1 year ago 0 children i doubt they ll do that i ll complain on the internet if they don t – marinprofesorpreda 8 points 9 points 10 points 1 year ago 4 children i don t get why that s disappointing as long as they translate every panel into video and it only takes them 12 episodes and they don t miss anything important what s the deal assuming they can get everything in more episodes would just mean filler do you want to see kaneki boil potatoes for a whole episode i don t. – megumin7 4 points 5 points 6 points 1 year ago 0 children judging from the opening they will be adapting 50+ chapters that s way too much for 12 episodes because they can t fit all the important details of these chapters into 12 episodes plus it will be pretty rushed – masteradventzero s 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago 0 children i would pay to see that – n1ghtw1ng7 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago 1 child it s not possible to fit all the important things into a 21 minuet per episode 12 episode long series the whole thing will have a runtime of roughly 4 hours and 20 minuets – marinprofesorpreda 5 points 6 points 7 points 1 year ago 0 children you forget the manga isn t all talk battle scenes go much faster in video than in manga and there s a lot of battle – dokkkanyeaze 3 points 4 points 5 points 1 year ago 0 children oh – immainlyherefortg 2 points 3 points 4 points 1 year ago 0 children it baffels me how some are suprised about this – edgelord09 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago 0 children not surprised wasn t even a bit hyped when they announced the anime oh well atleast it will promote tokyo ghoul to a wider audience – xgameboyy 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago 0 children – kirito_alsufi 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago 0 children i don t think so i mean really this will barley touch the important things on the manga – oneeyedking_ 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago 2 children they could have announced this on april fools – masteradventzero s 2 points 3 points 4 points 1 year ago 1 child they probably thought let s screw them here and now muhahahaha – oneeyedking_ 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago 0 children after watching the first ep they totally thought that – lpopo4lyfe 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago 0 children well the disappointment begins tokyo ghoul will never have a proper anime studio pierrot gets the last laugh when is tokyo ghoul root re coming 😐 – newsnotice 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago 1 child the opening showed stuff pretty later in the manga rip – masteradventzero s 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago 0 children try explaining that to anime only viewers – lionelnaff x1f370 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago 3 children they re probably stopping at reaper sasaki or before his reveal i think – nobushiakira 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago 2 children hope not that should at least be 24 eps – lionelnaff x1f370 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago 1 child it s in chapter 70 ish when reaper was revealed no if they re going 6 chapters an episode then we ll reach it – nobushiakira 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago 0 children

pleasebebetterthanseason2 pleasebebettertha – majora-98 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago 0 children that s not very hard to accomplish – oredaoree 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago 0 children i don t get the disappointment are people thinking this is going to have an original ending and end re with one cour the first episode just came out lol they are probably not organized enough to do more than one cour at once and are playing it safe there are a lot of factors at play such as budget sponsors and working out tv schedules i don t remember people being this antsy over the episode count when tg season 1 aired – anduinhellscream 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago 3 children and then garbage like bnha and blaxk clover get 1-2chap/ episode and actual good manga cant get proper adaptations – masteradventzero s 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago 2 children dude my hero academia was awesome – anduinhellscream 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago 1 child ye no – masteradventzero s 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 year ago 0 children hard slap in the face boi – fujinr4ijin 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago 0 children so it s likely it will rush through the story take a different path or wont even scratch the surface – hydrabubble 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago 0 children tbh i m fine with how the whole first episode played out they wanted to get people hooked on the anime and they couldn t really do that until the fight with serpent it would have been kinda lame if they ended the first episode on the candy ghoul and i see people saying things like oh man re s anime is gon na be rushed as fuck we saw a certain fight in the op when a lot of anime have things in the first opening not covered in the first arc season for example fma b steins gate guilty crown eureka 7 etc i ll hold out hope till they get to the fight in the the op then ill be mildly upset but i will still probably enjoy it for what it is unless they litterally take turns throwing up on it like they did with the animation in the shachi fight in root a – dgb_ 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 year ago 0 children why god why god do i got ta suffer posts are automatically
