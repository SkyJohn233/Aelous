effort everyone is an asset – susan cooper the social media scene is constantly changing brand new apps and features seem to pop up overnight and it s a mad dash to get on these platforms and start adding and tagging your friends and family but before you know it some of these sites are all but forgotten.in 2010 the popular image-sharing platform instagram was created though many doubted its long-term popularity instagram quickly took center stage as the latest social media craze it was so well-received in fact that the social-media-giant facebook bought the site for a mere 1 billion dollars just two years after instagram took off surely facebook saw the potential of the platform as a means to connect and engage with the world and with that transaction it became clear that instagram was here to stay businesses are now capitalizing on the widespread reach of the application and since the creation of the instagram business profile in 2016 there are now over 25 million business accounts on instagram to date in the eight short years since instagram was founded it gathered millions upon millions of users and as of june 2018 the site reached an amazing 1 billion monthly users with 500 million daily active users this puts instagram in second place behind facebook s 1.47 billion daily active users and right ahead of the declining snapchat with 191 million daily active users with all of the hype around instagram it only was a matter of time before advertisers began to take notice businesses took to instagram to do more than just promote their products they started engaging and interacting with their customers on a person to person level this changed the game for marketers across the industry not only were they able to advertise their business on social media—customers would actually seek them out nearly 80 of instagrammers say they have willingly followed a business account many of them follow multiple accounts and look at branded content every day since the instagram business profile was created in 2016 over 25 million businesses are active on the site they are liking commenting sharing and posting alongside of their customers even though these business profiles can do virtually anything a personal profile can with the sheer volume of content on instagram it is almost impossible to make their company s voice stand out instagram s algorithms are constantly shifting and with the latest algorithm update engagement is the new focal point if you want your content seen by large audiences so all of those likes comments and shares are what you ll need in order to get your brand in front of consumers as the importance of engagement becomes impossible to ignore businesses are choosing to buy instagram followers this choice instantly expands their audience and boosts their engagement rates instagram favors popular profiles in order to stand out as a business you need to have a heavy following the good news is followers lead to more followers if you make the choice to buy followers for instagram your site immediately is exposed to a much wider audience that is likely to follow you too even if another similar business page has the same level of engagement as yours if you have more followers instagram will rank your page much higher in searches this helps your page stand out amongst the rest and in turn people start flocking to your page if you have a strong following on one social media site it is likely that your popularity will spill over onto other platforms as well as we already said facebook owns instagram and it is entirely possible that the company will absorb other social networks in the future as well most platforms already work seamlessly together making it easy to share and send posts to many different sites the more followers you have on instagram the more likely it will be that your audience will share your posts on other platforms and send your posts to their friends across all networks scientists and psychologists have spent decades studying human behavior and time and time again they conclude that people look to their friends and peers to learn how to behave this idea even has a name it s called social proof when it comes to social media this rings true as well we care about knowing the latest trends and being the first to post that funny gif in a group chat not only do we care about knowing what s popular we care about looking popular ourselves consider this when you re browsing your instagram or facebook feed and you see a post that has been up for a day with very few likes and comments on it you will likely conclude that the post and the user is unpopular it is exactly the same for businesses if you are continually posting pictures that don t get a lot of engagement the followers you do have won t think that your business is very likeable or legitimate and may even unfollow you no one wants to be associated with something that is unpopular but buying instagram followers is a quick and easy fix for that problem social media is not just a tool for staying connected it has become a tool for rating and commenting about businesses having a lot of followers is the equivalent to a bunch of positive reviews on your yelp or trip advisor pages it goes back to the idea of social proof that we were talking about if a customer sees a lot of people follow and engage with your business they will think that it is a good idea to follow and engage with your business too but a low follower count can end the customer s journey before it really even gets started keep your potential clients interested by boosting your ratings and buying instagram followers today s consumer is much savvier than previous generations and desires trustworthy high-quality products they want to see that a business knows what it s doing has proven experience in its industry and that it s legitimate whether you re a small business or a budding social media influencer the more followers you have the more legit you will appear if you re constantly posting about how you have the best burger in town but have a measly 300 followers your customers aren t going to believe you no matter how big and juicy that double bacon cheese burger looks in that nofilter post if you don t have followers people will assume your restaurant isn t any good it s a marketer s best-kept secret you wouldn t think twice about paying for an ad to run in a magazine or on a website when you buy followers on instagram you are essentially doing the same thing you re buying ad space you re buying the opportunity to be seen by countless potential customers and you re buying the chance to be right in the palm of their hand that s better than ad space in a magazine because social media is much more personally connected to your customers think of buying followers like any other marketing expense you likely already pay to promote posts on either facebook or instagram nowadays you really do have to pay to play sure boosting a post on these sites may get you some extra likes and follows but it is unlikely that your profile will gain a significant following overnight the reality is you will be stuck paying out over and over again to only minimally tip the follower scale you could spend the same amount of money you would to boost a single post on purchasing instagram followers and experience significant results right before your eyes social media without question is a full-time job paying someone to manage your social media accounts can get pricey according to sprout social s blog the average social media manager makes well over 50,000 a year depending on experience level they can make nearly 70,000 a year—plus benefits many new businesses don t have the money or resources to employ a full-time social media manager but they re stuck with the fact that growing a healthy social media following takes time when you buy instagram
