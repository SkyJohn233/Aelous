space designer logic irs are installed bâ€¦ apple community looks like no one s replied in a while to start the conversation again simply ask a new question howdy i 'm using logic pro x 10.2 i can t load my logic space designer irs on the space designer interface via the drop down menu ie i can load irs one-by-one manually by clicking the ir button and trawling through my macbook library etc and doing it that way but obviously this is not coolâ€¦ this is where my space designer logic irs downloaded to by default users/garethebbs/music/audio music apps/plug-in settings/space designer 2 users/garethebbs/music/audio music apps/impulse responses in the logic effects manual it states all impulse responses that ship with logic pro are installed in the /library/audio/impulse responses/apple folder deconvolution files have an .sdir file extension. so i have copied the ir folders in there also i don t have this folder below i do n't think it ever existed on my macbook pro but some people have mentioned they have their logic irs in there library application support logic impulse responses so i set up this folder and copied the irs in there to try but nothing happened so i deleted it again to return my computer to original settings i also tried copying them into library application support logic plug-in settings space designer but this didn t do anything eitherâ€¦so i deleted them back out the only irs that are actually working properly ie they are actually showing in the dropdown space designer window see pic are some lexicon 480l irs which i downloaded and as per the instructions from the 3rd party website i put them into /users/garethebbs/music/audio music apps/plug-in settings/space designer /users/garethebbs/music/audio music apps/impulse responses the logic irs are in there tooâ€¦but obviously they do not appear with the lexicons in the dropdown menu i 've also tried installing other lexicons pcm90 with no success tried all possible locations just very frustrated at this pointâ€¦any help would be greatly appreciated hope my post isn t too confusingâ€¦i m pretty confused myself at this stageâ€¦ thanks gar pic this is what i get when i click the dropdown bar as mentioned above no logic irs just third party lexicons macbook pro with retina display os x yosemite 10.10.4 posted on jan 23 2016 5:19 am loading page content page content loaded jan 23 2016 8:06 am in response to denalihighway in response to denalihighway this is correct note this is the system library not the user library which is where i am guessing you have been looking go to finder 's menu bar.. choose go and then go to folder option.. now paste the following into there and press return /library/audio/impulse responses/apple you should find all the responses there the user folder users/ user name /music/audio music apps/impulse responses is for presets you save yourself via the dropdown menu in the plugin itself plus any 3rd party presets.. that might get installed there.. jan 23 2016 8:06 am jan 23 2016 8:12 am in response to the art of sound in response to the art of sound as i said having the irs is not the problem i have the irs they are in that folder you have described above as well as other locations as described and i did as you said and copy-pasted the link in etc just to double check see pic below i can load them one by one if i really want to they are on the computer seemingly in the correct location s my problem is the irs do not show up in the dropdown menu at the sd interface see pic above jan 23 2016 8:12 am jan 23 2016 8:23 am in response to denalihighway in response to denalihighway ok.. you are talking about presets not the sdir files themselves the built in presets are found in the system library as follows /library/application support/logic/plug-in settings/space designer in my case.. with my system drive named server hd they are here jan 23 2016 8:23 am jan 23 2016 9:04 am in response to the art of sound in response to the art of sound ahhh ok looks like someone has finally pointed me the right direction ðŸ™‚ sorry it seems like i should have been labelling what was missing the presets and not just irs like i had said so this is my version of that location macintosh hd /library/application support/logic/plug-in settings/space designer and lo and behold practically blank i guess i got ta get my hands on those pst files and get them in there i 'm new to logic and macs btw too it probably shows jan 23 2016 9:04 am jan 23 2016 9:17 am in response to denalihighway in response to denalihighway no problem welcome to the wonderful though sometimes mysterious world of apple ðŸ™‚ anyhow the question is.. why did n't they get installed as normal try this download the excellent find any file from here http //apps.tempel.org/findanyfile/ and then use that to search your system drive for the following word.. opulent that should bring up a file called 06.5s opulent ballroom.pst wherever that is.. is where the rest of your presets are .. if its not there then use the logic pro x menu item logic pro x sound library and check via the sound library manager that all content including reverbs has been installed if it say it has then use reinstall sound library to reinstall all the content that should have been automatically downloaded including the missing presets into the correct locations note this command will download and install all the content again which is about 60gb but it seems it might be worth it as who knows whatever you are missing .. or.. rather than playing safe or if you have slow internet or limited download capacities.. open the sound library manager via the same menu option and reselect and download the essential content the reverb content and the legacy logic pro 2 and gb content by clicking on the check boxes.. it will ask if you want to download all again or just what has n't been installed.. select all and see if thats enough to fix your problem jan 23 2016

2016 1:16 am mar 26 2016 8:51 pm in response to denalihighway in response to denalihighway hey guys so i 'm actually having the exact same problem except i 'm not even seeing anything in the dropdown other than the default ir files i have gone though all of the steps listed above and i 've copied my own ir folder to hd library audio impulse responses apple hd users joeconstantino music audio music apps plug-in settings space designer hd library application support logic plug-in settings space designer i am having the same issue where i can load them individually but not via the menu or even see them in the menu any and all help would be very appreciated thank you best joe mar 26 2016 8:51 pm mar 26 2016 8:53 pm in response to denalihighway in response to denalihighway i should mention â€“ my ir files are from the bricasti m7 set highly recommended .. they are wav files they worked great in altiverb and as i mentioned they work when i load them individually in space designer but they 're not showing up at all in the dropdown menu thank you again mar 26 2016 8:53 pm mar 26 2016 9:11 pm in response to jconstantino in response to jconstantino for actual ir files put the folder which contains your irs in if you don t yet have the impulse responses folder in that location create it spelled exactly as shown above upper case/space etc note pay attention to the tilde at the beginning of the path ..indicating this folder in a user folder and not a system one for further guidance see the following http //logic-pro-expert.com/logic-pro-blog/2014/02/20/lexicon-480l-free-impulse- responses-for-space-designer.html .vvdz6â€¦ however in sd via the drop down menu.. those are not ir files you are accessing or seeing.. those are pst preset files you need to create a user preset for any given ir file for it to appear in the drop down menu again see the example zip file provided in the web article i linked to above and you will see what i mean mar 26 2016 9:11 pm question q space designer logic irs are installed but still not appearing in dropdown menu on space designer interface more less
