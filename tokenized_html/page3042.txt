nott 18 with her son willow 13 months and abreia reighard 17 with her daughter zuhraya 2 were able to complete the alternative school s program and will be graduating this sunday it seems a small miracle that abreia reighard is graduating today from the bridger alternative program at bozeman high school reighard came to bozeman as a 15-year-old kicked out of butte high and four months pregnant thanks to her own hard work and determination and the supportive bridger teachers she was able to raise her daughter zuhraya hold down jobs at local plumbing and photography businesses and complete high school while fighting cervical cancer now in remission today she will be one of bridger s graduation speakers i really didn t think i would graduate because of all the stress and trauma reighard 17 said friday somehow i pulled it off because i was in bridger i m really like proud of myself i m really grateful how things worked out. this is the 19th year for the bridger alternative program which was created to help teenage moms and teens at risk of dropping out to succeed and graduate bridger has 32 graduates and about 21 are expected to walk during today s noon graduation ceremony at willson auditorium students have the option of attending bridger s ceremony the larger bozeman high ceremony on sunday or both mike ruyle assistant principal in charge of bridger says the program is vibrant and thriving despite undergoing major changes two years ago it was forced to make a controversial move from its longtime home at willson school to the southeast wing of bozeman high as a budget-cutting measure last year only 13 students graduated this school year bridger adopted a completely new performance-based education program instead of earning credits by sitting in class 180 days a year and scraping by with a c or d bridger students now must earn credit by showing proficiency in the skills and knowledge standards required for each class students can work at their own pace but have to perform at an a or b level if their work isn t up to snuff they get an incomplete and have to keep at it it s been a tough year in many ways ruyle said because the program was new for both students and teachers halfway through the school year 85 percent of the students had incompletes. kids got discouraged ruyle said he got phone calls from upset parents saying what do you mean if he gets a c it s not good enough but then around february he said it clicked for kids and they started to rocket through. one girl finished two years of math in one year four students finished early i think we ve had phenomenal results in engagement and student achievement ruyle said it s a great system and we re only going to get better. this year s graduates are truly trailblazers ruyle said i ve never been prouder of kids. bridger taught at least one class to more than 150 students this year we re serving more kids at a higher level ruyle said today s second graduation speaker is lyn americanhorse jr. 18 who came to bridger at age 15 from the northern cheyenne reservation there he used to skip class to smoke or drink and he got in trouble with the law for assault coming from a community of 1,000 people to much larger bozeman was a rough transition at bridger americanhorse said he found teachers and counselors who believed in him and bonded with bridger students we re all one big family he said in his sophomore year he was doing math at a fifth-grade level and english at fourth-grade he said at my lowest i never thought i would graduate from high school. bridger staff visited the northern cheyenne reservation in february and americanhorse came to speak to educators there about the performance-based system without it he said i wouldn t have graduated. people in the audience had tears in their eyes ruyle said now the reservation school is looking into adopting the system two more young mothers graduating today are santina morrison and rose nott both 18 i failed a lot of classes my freshman year morrison said because she was hanging out with the wrong crowd and skipping school thanks to bridger she was able to catch up on missed schooling have her baby ava now 3 months old and still graduate on time one english teacher perri sherrill even came to her home to help when she found out she was pregnant with ava morrison said i wanted to go to college to give her a better life â€¦ she s a really big motivator for me. now she plans to move to denver attend community college and study to become a nurse i just hope we can continue this program morrison said of bridger to help kids pursue their dreams. nott mother of 13-month-old son willow said she moved here from billings and was just going to drop out but bridger teachers worked with her and helped her graduate she now plans to attend the gallatin college at montana state university the performance-based system is better because you can choose topics you want to study nott said but it s also harder you have to put more effort into it i think it s a cool system. having a high school diploma will be good when her son is in high school nott said it s a good role model for him to stay in school. jan benham an english teacher at bridger since 1993 said the new performance-based program is successful we re still at the dinosaur stage she said it s really educationally good really sound. one of the major changes is that bridger is no longer an island unto itself an isolated community because of budget cuts it no longer has its own full-time administrator secretary counselor or teachers bridger teachers also teach regular bozeman high classes people have tried hard in difficult times to keep it going to keep the spirit and keep serving kids benham said i definitely think it serves kids. gail
