seismic performance of reduced web section moment connections springerlink this service is more advanced with javascript available learn more at http //activatejavascript.org advertisement international journal of steel structures june 2017 volume 17 issue 2 pp 413â€“425 cite as seismic behavior of beam-to-column connections can be improved by shifting the location of inelasticity away from the column s face such connections can be achieved by reducing the flange area at a specific distance from the beam-column connection called reduced beam section rbs or by reducing web area by introducing a perforation into the web called reduced web section rws this paper presents a parametric study that is carried out on the effect of the perforation size perforation location and the beam span length in the rws connections using finite element modeling next an interaction formula is derived for design purposes and a step by step design method is developed finally a frame is analyzed to verify the reliability of the proposed design process and assess the impact of the rws connections on the behavior of special moment frames the study concludes that rws connections can effectively improve seismic performance of special moment frames causing plastic hinges to form around the perforation away from the column s face advertisement over 10 million scientific documents at your fingertips 2019 springer nature switzerland ag part of springer nature not logged in google search crawler 3000811494 66.249.75.102 your privacy strictly necessary cookies performance cookies functional cookies targeting cookies more information active always active we use cookies to personalise content and ads to provide social media features and to analyse our traffic we also share information about your use of our site with our social media advertising and analytics partners in accordance with our privacy statement you can manage your preferences in manage cookies
