expediency 14 singleton makes the decision after considering to let the native die that they might find the man useful to them during the arduous march through lands teeming with leopards elephants crocodiles and snakes the travellers avoid catastrophe because of their modern weaponry and their european belief in reason rather than in magic the marchers meet an english merchant who has been

a dutch settlement where they divide the spoils and immediately go their separate ways 15 once singleton has spent his fortune in england he sets out again this time for the west indies where by his

there are chases and sea battles in which singleton proves himself an able courageous and imaginative leader from the indies the scene shifts to the east african coast and madagascar where the pirates
