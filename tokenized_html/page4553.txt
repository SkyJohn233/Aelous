seven the breakup notice me noona yandere kim taehyung in her small apartment name was pacing around mindlessly she was subliminally biting one finger nail at a time due to her excessive anxiety just an hour and a half ago she woke up with a headache swollen eyes and in sweat additionally her stomach was sore in hunger lately name was feeling extremely emotionally drained which was affecting the quality of her sleep she slept for eight hours but her body felt more exhausted and it felt as if she had not slept at all she had eaten some fruit for breakfast in hopes that a light healthy and fulfilling breakfast would help it did not she felt full but the pain of hunger was replaced with the sensation of needing to throw up her anxiety was too overwhelming name walked towards her small dressing mirror unit which was the only one she could afford as a struggling university student she roughly swatted the hair strands that loomed over her face to one side before picking up a natural shade of lipstick and applying it lightly to distract herself from her anxiety just as she finished doing so her phone rang loudly it was an expected call however prior to its ringing name s room was silent as a result the phone s sudden loudness made her wince name grabbed her phone and slid the green icon to accept the call she brought it up to her ears h-hey she stuttered as a greeting right away she could imagine mina furrowing her eyebrows and vicki frowning in concern for her hey name mina greeted softly over the phone her voice was gentle because presently name was vulnerable this was her first relationship and soon name was going to put an end to it it just her luck that her first boyfriend had to be an anomalous personality mina thought that if she said the wrong thing or spoke in even a slightly different tone name would break are you ready vicki enquired from the other side of the phone her voice sounded slightly static and muffled i-i think so name stammered and her lips formed a forced smile in response as if she was talking to her friends in person however her balant lie was obvious and her friends heard her nervousness in her voice on the other line they frowned name it ll be fine everything will work out remember our plan you need to convince taehyung to meet you in a public place then texts us the location pick a busy place so when we ll be watching to make sure nothing goes wrong he won t spot us everything will be fine girl don t worry we ll be with you every step of the way mina said reassuringly name s uneasiness did not cease however mina s words offered her comfort it was in moments like these that reminded name about how amazing and supportive her friends were she was grateful for their existence and made a mental note to treat them to some cheap ice coffee after all this mess would be dealt with thanks you guys i appreciate your support a lot i ll text you soon name said alright mina and vicki responded simultaneously i ll see you soon hopefully name said see ya they replied and name was about to end the call however before she could vicki screeched which made name s eyes widen in panic what what is it what happened i heard a scream are you guys okay name asked panic laced in her voice her heart was pounding loudly against her rib-cage we forgot to tell you we love you name no matter what happens we ll always be there for you vicki said and instantly name could imagine her grinning slyly for a few moments she felt too startled to form a response then she sweat-dropped before she ended up smiling i love you guys too now i m going to hang up before you give me a real heart-attack name said and as her friends mumbled a last see you she ended the call name tapped various spots on the screen of her phone until she opened her thread of messages for taehyung there were no new texts from him name bit her lip in disappointment and nervousness she felt disappointed because with how he showed his love she expected taehyung to have had texted her eventually but that was also completely egotistical and unfair since she was the cause of the tension between them she had not even tried to make it up to him now she was going to break up with him because he was too overwhelming that sounded like utter bullshit and a part of name was whispering toxicity in her ears you made it all up nothing happened taehyung was never horrible to you you re the horrible one it s all your fault name it s all your fault your pathetic and you can t even be honest you just used taehyung as an object to make yourself feel like you were worth someone s time but you re not you re worthless a coward and that s why you re taking the easy way out again running away from everything everytime name shut her eyes tightly her lips quivered she needed to counter her thoughts and reassure herself the way her friends had it s not my fault it s not my fault i m not imagining anything it happened and i was hurt i need to get out of this she repeated those words like a mantra in her head with shaky fingers she managed to compose and send a text to taehyung her text read hey are you free i was wondering if we could meet up at east meadow mall she exhaled deeply name was not expecting taehyung to reply or agree to meet up at such a public place after all he always set up their meetings in very private places however it seemed as if with all her bad luck some good luck finally existed for her because his response was instant taehyung sure *** the mall was not as busy as name had hoped for but it was still bustling with life the loudness from everyone s spoken words footsteps and other various causes were part of the background because name and taehyung were sitting in the food court they inhaled aroma of all sorts of different foods which made name feel hungrier her stomach grumbled out loud which made her cheeks heat up in embarrassment she coughed awkwardly before she started to unwrap her burger that was settled on a tray before her we should eat she said avoiding taehyung s gaze she kept her eyes locked on her food and bit into it as name continued to eat taehyung was staring intensely at her his eyes were narrowed and his lips were pressed in a thin line i m not hungry taehyung said as he leaned his elbows on the table and settled his chin against the back of his hands at his voice name froze like a prey caught in the line of sight of its predator name s eyes shifted to taehyung s instantly she was hypnotized by his coffee-coloured eyes she was unable to breath especially when she saw taehyung s eyes examine her up and down his eyes lingered on her lips for a few seconds too long before they moved back to her eyes momentarily he adjusted the watch on his wrist before he sat up and leaned back against the chair s back support the corner of his lips were twitched upwards in a smirk you look nice he complimented nonchalantly the pink on name s cheeks darkened into a shade of red i don t want to be here she thought as she murmured a low thanks. then to avoid having to speak anymore name took a big bite from her burger taehyung continued to watch her a few minutes passed before he sighed exaggeratedly is this your of making it up to me he said and shook his head in disappointment mid-bite name stilled she furrowed her eyebrows in confusion what name asked in disbelief taehyung raised an eyebrow aren t you making it up to me you know for all the awful things you ve done recently you need to step up your game name -noona this is disappointing taehyung started frowning if you really want to make it up to me i can think of other ways for you to do it he finished and a sly smile appeared on his face as one of his hands reached out towards hers as soon as their fingers touched on instinct name snatched her hand away from taehyung i m not making up for anything name stated bluntly and she stared at taehyung with wide eyes i already apologized for that you were the one who ignored me she finished as she scanned the food court behind taehyung nervously in hopes to spot her friends she did not recognize anyone sweat started to form on the back of her neck taehyung looked at name with a penetrating stare truthfully she was talking to him however she was looking for someone else if she was on a date with him and talking to him then her attention should only be on him but it wasn t his lovely noona was searching for someone else where are mina and vicki name thought frantically when she failed to spot them her fingers trembled as she felt taehyung digging daggers in her anxious form she was going to break up with him and she desperately needed to know that her friends were there for her like they promised they would be are you looking for someone taehyung asked stoically his question caused name to snap her eyes towards him and she looked like a deer caught in headlights name almost couldn t speak w-what she stuttered forcefully as she stared deeply in taehyung s eyes which were filled with suspicion for a moment he pressed his lips in a thin line in agitation his nose wrinkled in anger however he inhaled and exhaled deeply in order to keep himself calm i said are you looking for someone as in you re not paying your full attention to me like you re suppose to who are you waiting for taehyung said through gritted teeth name was at a loss of words she opened her mouth like a fish out of water but no words left her mouth she couldn t think she felt timorous her shoulders were tensed and it was starting to be overwhelming she would have given into her anxiety if it was not for mina and vicki entering her sights both of the females were dressed in large black hoodies which covered their body and hung over their faces so it would be difficult to identify them they were wearing large black glasses that covered almost more than half of their faces as they waved to signal name of their presence the h/c female visibly relaxed and breathed out in relief her shoulders relaxed visibly and she almost smiled but she did not when her eyes landed on taehyung he was looking at her with a mixture of fury and scepticism written on his face she inwardly winced as she gulped she needed to get this done and over with and in order to do so she mentally prepared herself shakingly she intertwined her fingers together and settled them on top of the table before her she clenched her hands until they turned white as taehyung watched her every move i-i was just trying to build the courage to do this name started and taehyung narrowed her eyes at her his gaze was piercing and it felt like he was staring right in her soul name felt exposed because the way his eyes were fixated onto her was as if taehyung knew of what she was going to do but that was impossible right i-i wasn t waiting for anyone else i just needed to talk to you name said you re a liar my noona oh what did you need to talk about taehyung asked with a raised eyebrow name gulped as she fiddled with her fingers this was it this was wanted she wanted to do she was sure of it i-i want to break up name said the spoken words were ones she had prepared to speak multiple times other than the stutter in the beginning she spoke them well she was certain that this was what she wanted the response she received was not the one she expected okay taehyung said and shrugged his shoulders name s eyebrows crinkled in confusion she doubted her reality and thought that taehyung s response was a figment of her imagination after all taehyung loved her and there was no way that he just agreed to her preposition so simply right what name said in disbelief to her question taehyung shrugged once more let s break up that s what you asked right there s no point for us to keep dating if you obviously aren t happy well i wouldn t really say we dated since we didn t even kiss… not that i m holding that against you actually thank you instead of leading me on and wasting my time you ended it soon so thanks taehyung said and smiled name gasped aren t you going to fight me for it name asked mindlessly you want me to fight you even though you broke up with me isn t that a bit too narcissist taehyung replied and raised an eyebrow the implication of her own words finally registered in name s mind her cheeks turned crimson in embarrassment i-i didn t mean to say that name stammered in a poor attempt to defend herself and reserve any dignity she may have had left taehyung chuckled i m just joking you re adorable when you become so flustered taehyung complimented tilting his head and giving her a small smile the hue of red spread further across name s cheeks she felt beyond awkward so she covered her face with her hands right after the sound of a chair squeaking against the surface of the floor was heard which made her look up taehyung had stood up as he picked up a few of his things i ll be leaving now taehyung said as his eyes were focused on name who was staring at him with doe eyes name s chest felt tight okay she said in a low tone don t go i ll see you around taehyung said and watched her with an intense gaze see you name replied her voice sounding oddly high-pitched don t leave me her thoughts echoed taehyung s gaze lingered on her for a few seconds before he gave her one last wave and walked away as name watched him leave and the distance between them increased her heart felt oddly strained she was certain that this is what she needed and this breakup was for the best but then why did it feel so wrong her gaze was casted downwards on the table in front of her she did not notice when taehyung was completely out of her sights name felt nothing until she felt two pairs of arms wrap around her in a comforting gesture without her permission a few tears prickled the corner of her eyes and began to roll down her cheeks oh name mina began softly as she patted name s hair vicki was frowning while she looked at name in pity everything will be okay vicki reassured as name returned their hugs and wept silently the grieving group of friends were too focused in the moment to notice the pair of coffee-coloured eyes which glared at them murderously from a distance a/n hello i hope you liked the chapter it would be great if you could leave some feedback thanks
