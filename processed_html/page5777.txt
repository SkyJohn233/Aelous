Chinese characters of Empress Wu - Wikipedia The  Chinese characters of Empress Wu , or the  Zetian characters  ( Chinese : 則天文字 ;  pinyin : Zétiān wénzì ), are  Chinese characters  introduced by  Empress Wu Zetian , the only  empress regnant  in the  history of China , in order to demonstrate her power. The characters were not created by the Empress herself, but were suggested by an official named  Zong Qinke , the son of one of her cousins, in December, 689 AD. The number of characters varies between 12, 17, 19, or 30. Her subjects were forced to use them during her reign, but they fell into disuse immediately after her death, so they help to determine dates of printed materials. A few of the surviving characters are preserved in the written histories of Wu Zetian, and a few have found themselves incorporated into modern-day computer standards, classified as either variant or dialect-specific characters.  The form of the characters varies depending on where they are printed. For instance Empress Wu's own name  照 zhào  was replaced with  瞾 , but is erroneously [ citation needed ]  thought to be  曌 , and looking in the  Kangxi Dictionary , one finds the description of the former, having two  目  ("eye") characters, being the proper character, rather than  明 míng  ("bright"). Wu was China's only empress, and she exercised her power by introducing many reforms. In addition to changing the way people dressed, she wanted to change the words people used. Empress Wu's written reforms resulted in new characters, which were not created from scratch, but borrowed elements of older characters. When the Wu dynasty ended, the original words were recovered as people eventually forgot how to write the introduced characters. Some [ which? ]  of the characters ended up being preserved in other countries. [ which? ] Anecdotes about the reign of Empress Wu can be read in the  Old Book of Tang .
