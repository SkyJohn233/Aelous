results differed because mice used in our study were subjected to forced exercise from the age of 4 weeks until time of blood sampling 8 weeks and 14 weeks and sacrifice 16 weeks we examined the gene expression of these three biomarkers in exercised mdx and nonexercised mdx mice no significant differences in gene expression were observed between the exercised and nonexercised group for any of the biomarkers we did however observe that inter mouse variation was higher in the exercised mdx group compared to the mdx and exercised wt it has been suggested that the beneficial or deleterious effect of exercise on dystrophic muscles depends on the age of the animal at the start of exercise the severity of pathology the intensity and the duration and type of training 21 x 21 carter g.t. abresch

mmp-9 levels were significantly higher in older nonambulant patients compared to the younger ambulant patients suggesting that there is an increase in mmp-9 levels with disease progression results of the longitudinal study supported this observation as levels of mmp-9 increased with age for individual patients while this study reports on both mmp-9 and timp-1 levels in serum of dmd patients gene

nonambulant and ambulant patients the correlation between mmp-9 levels and duration of corticosteroid therapy needs further analysis the patient cohort in our study was limited by the number of patients who were steroid naïve and for patients that were on corticosteroid therapy age and duration of treatment was confounded making it difficult to discriminate between disease progression due to age and effects of steroid treatment from the limited studies available on mmp-9 levels and corticosteroid therapy one study on serum levels of patients with graves ophthalmology and another on gene

mmp-9 was further strengthened by the results of the linear mixed-effects analysis in the longitudinal dmd cohort as there was a significant and positive linear relationship between mmp-9 levels and age i.e disease progression and the duration of steroid treatment did not contribute significantly to this relationship thus based on our findings and information available from the above mentioned literature we suggest that elevated mmp-9 levels are due to disease progression rather than the effect of corticosteroid treatment although we observed timp-1 levels to be significantly higher in dmd compared to controls there was no significant difference in levels between ambulant and nonambulant groups or a significant correlation with age however due to the recent findings that plasma timp-1

as a consequence of the continued inflammatory response in dmd patients even after substantial muscle degeneration effective therapy should reduce the degeneration-induced inflammatory response future studies have to confirm whether mmp-9 and timp-1 indeed decrease after dystrophin restoration and therefore are useful as biomarkers to monitor therapeutic responses due to their role in inflammation
