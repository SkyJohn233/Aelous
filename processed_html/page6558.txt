MuseScore Example Manager sqeezes image | MuseScore I tried the MuseScore Example Manager and did not get the expected results. I'm using MuseScore 2.0.2 portable, LibreOffice is V 5.0.4.2 installed locally, Example Manager 2.0.0. I import an .MSCZ file, apply rightclick - Format Image, on the tab "Type" I set "Width" as required. Save and reopen, the MSCZ is included as expected. Then I try to cut out just a part of the score: rightclick - Format Image, on the tab "Crop" I select "Keep scale" and enter just a value into "Bottom" to remove the lower part of the score and keep the upper part. As long as the document stays open, it looks as expected, see attachment BlackIsBlack_1.png. Now I save the file and reopen it again: The imported score is still there, the size is as before, but it does not show the cut-out part. Instead there's the whole score page, squeezed to the height I have set, see BlackIsBlack_2.png Is there something wrong with my workflow? What's the intended way to use Example Manager? Is there some explanation or manual how to use it? I wanted to write all the score parts I need into one .MSCZ file, import it several times and cut out the snippets that I need. Should I better use separate MSCZ files for every snippet and avoid cropping in LibreOffice? I'm not quite following what you are doing - in what oprogram are you trying to cut a portion of the image?  From LibreOffice?  If so, then whatever issue you are seeing is a LbreOffice issues.  The "MuseScore Example Manager" inserts the iage for you, but once it is inserted, it is done with its job.  Anything else you do with that image is just LibreOffice doing whatever it would normally do. I'm also not understand your question about how you are / why you are using the example manager in the first place.  It almost sounds like you are trying to use LibreOffice to assemble parts for your score rather than simply using File / Parts.  Are you aware MuseScore can do that automatically? The intended use for the Example Manager is just to be able to insert short musical examples into a text document, like if you are writing a textbook.  So you'd create each example as a separate score containing just that example, and use the Example Manager to insert them into your LibreOffice document. Reply In reply to  I ' m not quite following what  by  Marc Sabatella Thank you for your quick and helpful reply. I was able to fix it. The essential hint was "whatever issue you are seeing is a LibreOffice issues. The "MuseScore Example Manager" inserts the image for you, but once it is inserted, it is done with its job." MSEM inserts the image as a link. This is the correct way to do it. If I manually insert an image with the "Link" checkbox set, I get the same result as by using MSEM. Then I cut out a part of the image with Libre Office Writer's "Crop" function. I rightclick the image and call "Format Image". I select the "Crop" tab and set Keep scale = ON, Crop - Bottom: 18,5 cm The crop function calculates Image Size - Height: 7,22 cm which is the remaining rest of the image's A4 size. And now the difference that makes it work or not: If I save as  .DOC  and reopen, the Crop - Bottom value is lost and reset to 0 cm. Just Image Size - Height is kept and the image is squeezed to the height of 7,22 cm as I reported in my previous post. If I save as  .ODT  and reopen, both Crop - Bottom and Image Size - Height are kept and everything is fine. Reply In reply to  I ' m not quite following what  by  Marc Sabatella Why I'm doing this: I sometimes reduce scores to a one page cheat sheet containg just a few measures of written music, some chords, parts of lyrics lines, ..., whatever is helpful for me to memorize a song. The attached examples were created with WinWord, the score snippets are exported as graphics out of Finale. Switching now to LibreOffice and MuseScore I think that your Example Manager will be a real help, especially in case the score snippets need editing. Thank you very much for making and providing it. Reply In reply to  I ' m not quite following what  by  Marc Sabatella I have some trouble updating the inserted .PNG. Ctrl+Leftclick on the picture opens MuseScore correctly. I make a change in the .MSCZ, close MuseScore and save the changes. In the (still open) .ODT file I select the image and click the MSEM icon. MuseScore is opened in the background and updates the .PNG. Then the updated .PNG is shown, but with the original size, cropping and resizing is lost. Libre Office hangs and I close the .ODT discarding changes. When I try reopen the .ODT it it takes very very long to load. Reply In reply to  I have some trouble updating  by  SqueezeBoxer Yeah, I wouldn't expect the re-inserted links to keep the editing you've done - it's a new image.  Basically, the expectation is that you create the score in MuseScore *already* reduced to just the measures you want.  That's kind of the point - so you don't *have* to do any cropping or resizing manually.  Create the example in MuseScore exactly the way you want it, and it gets inserted that way.  It handles the cropping of excess white space from the marigns, so you don't have to worry about that. Reply Do you still have an unanswered question?  Please log in first  to post your question.
