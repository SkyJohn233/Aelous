In recent months, I started getting monthly CLIs of $300, then it became $400 (which I am guessing is due to my much higher FICO scores). I was declined last month for CLIs on both cards, which stood at $5200 and $4800 respectively . Today was the monthly day to check for CLIs again. I did the usual routine, and I was given $2000 CLIs for each card, bringing them to $7200 (Overstock) and $6800 (Wayfair). This was a pleasant surprise, but I'm wondering if my recent scores had something to do with it. I have made recent purchases on both card, but for small amounts. Anyway, it's a nice way to start the weekend! Scores: EX: 724, TU: 734, EQ: 717. I only wish they would start using Fico09 since those are more than 30 points higher each. Nice indeed! Way to go That is interesting. I didn't see the hp option on either of my accounts, but maybe that's because I was too busy typing my income into that field. due to your post i went on my wayfair and put in a request myself and recieved $800 increase myself After reading this thread, I decided to try my luck with my HSN card. Ive always gotten $250 or $300. Today, BAM $2k. Approval was so fast, that I know they didnt HP me.
