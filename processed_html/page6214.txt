Man jailed for unprovoked sectarian hammer attack - The Irish News  A man who brutally beat a Catholic with a hammer because he moved into a loyalist area has been jailed for four years.   Paul mcGarrigle (42) admitted a series of charges including attempted grievous bodily harm with intent following the sectarian attack on December 22 2012.   Derry Crown Court was told that his victim had recently moved into a new property with two friends in the city's Waterside and was holding a housewarming party. At around 2am a group of men arrived outside the house at Bond Street and used a hammer to gain entry.   They then made sectarian comments with the defendant saying "You Fenian b*****d. He's a Fenian living in Bond Street."   The victim stood up and was punched by mcGarrigle, falling to the ground. When he tried to get up he was then struck with a hammer on the head.   While on the ground the man was also subjected to kicks and punches and bottles were thrown at him.   The victim suffered a laceration to his head and bruising on his body and was said to be fearful and has left the area. At interview, mcGarrigle - of Foyle Crescent in newbuildings near Derry - told police that he had been at the house but denied having a hammer.   He said he did remember punching someone and then "kicking the lining out of him".   Sentencing him to four years in jail followed by four on licence, Judge Philip Babington said there were a number of aggravating factors in the case including the fact a weapon had been used and the victim was deliberately targeted for sectarian reasons.   "This is an appalling case in which a young man was badly beaten in his own home for no other reason than the defendant considered he was of the wrong religion to be living in that particular area," he said.   Describing it as "a completely unprovoked sectarian attack", the judge added: "It is fortunate for the defendant that the injured party was not more seriously hurt.   "It is also clear that by the time the defendant had finished with the injured party he was lying unconscious in his own front room." Meanwhile, at Derry magistrate's Court yesterday, mcGarrigle was also sentenced in connection with another case.   The court was told that on June 28 last year, police were called to Foyle Crescent and when they arrived they found a woman in the street with her three children.   The woman had a bloody nose and was in her bare feet and the children had no coats on them.   She told police that mcGarrigle had assaulted her and then pushed her and the children out into the street. After hearing from a defence lawyer that the 42-year-old had just received a heavy sentence in the Crown Court, Judge Barney mcElholm sentenced him to five months.
