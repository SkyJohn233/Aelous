degree of chemical inertness gold coatings also produce some of the most efficient infrared reflectors it is also used to produce the reflective surfaces of x-ray optics deposited by way of vacuum vapor deposition gold is being used for mirror coatings in the james webb space telescope gold also is used as a dye to create some of the most intense colors of red glass gold is one of the most ductile elements there is drawn into a wire that is one micron in diameter twenty ounces of gold will encircle the earth a single ounce can be stretched to 1250 miles long as aside from its high

very highest reliability i.e. satellite grade integrated circuits use gold wire bonds the high density of gold makes it very resistant to electromigration -related failures the malleability of gold enables smiths to create some of the most amazing jewelry the following image is of a masterwork from the gold of ancestors exhibit at the ayala museum in manila it is a world-class display of artifacts that demonstrate how the philippines had a high-functioning artistic culture long before any spanish colonization anyone traveling to manila can not afford to miss this treasure trove watch all eight parts of the video and you will be amazed a mere twenty grams of gold can be hammered into a sheet that will spread over six square meters gold can be wrought so thin that light will pass through it it also comes in many colors according to how it is alloyed 7,370 views 1,257 views 6,212 views 1,332 views 22,066 views yes gold has many scientific purposes that provide value gold is a very good electrical and thermal conductor it is very ductile and it does not oxidize corrode or tarnish these properties make it extremely useful in electronics and you can find gold in every computer and cellular phone on the market today from wire bonding au is used in the aerospace industry due to its reflectivity in the infrared frequencies thus providing thermal protection to critical components it is even used as a lubricant and again its non-corrosive properties make it ideal for contacts in electrical-m yes gold has many scientific purposes that provide value gold is a very good
