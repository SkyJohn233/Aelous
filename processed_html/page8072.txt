I am relatively new and inexperienced in the world of C#. Therefore, this question probably warrants a simlpe answer! However, I am attempting to develop a basic windows forms application which loops through a folder on a server and returns its results in a textbox. The problem that I have is that I have managed to output to the text box although System.String[] is repeated as opposed to the contents of the folder! Any help would be greatly appreciated; Your foreach needs to show the  file , but you are showing the array                                 Click here to upload your image                                 (max 2 MiB) Cancel and add another image You can also provide a  link from the web .
