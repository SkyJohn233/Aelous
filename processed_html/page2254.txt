Hardware is not so important, the important thing is the speed of the network.I found the HTTP download speed is pretty good from your test IP.So I'm thinking about whether this VPS can be used as a VPN server. You know, VPN server is important to the Chinese. I happen to be a blogger, so I want to test the network performance of this VPS. If it is still good, I think you will get some Chinese customers. So do you have any plans for replenishment? @RIYAD  does France OpenVZ VPS come with ipv6 subnet? @MadLifer  can do 4G Ram at Serbia atm . @tenpera  sorry , IPv6 is not available .
