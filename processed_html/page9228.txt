Learning to teach | The BMJ Intended for healthcare professionals   I was very interested to read Philippa Jackson's experiences. Something that I, and most of us, have experienced from early SHO days and, for me, led to much time in medical education.    Doctors have this time-honoured requisite to teach their followers, but not all want to. Those that do require educational training - but at what time should this begin? With such a crowded curriculum, limited time and resources, it is difficult to start early in one's career but there is a strong case for such training to be made available from SHO level onwards and mandatory for those involved in training doctors and medical students once they have reached higher levels in their speciality.     The Colleges and regions have made a good effort in this area but unfortunately the necessary levels are not being reached. Competing interests: None declared Competing interests:            No competing interests   Jackson’s article (1), highlighting the difficulties in teaching from the junior doctor’s perspective, certainly made for an interesting read. Perhaps ironic then that this reply comes from a student (especially one located round the corner at Birmingham Medical School!). I would like to respond to the queries raised by Jackson regarding practical ways of improving one’s teaching and the necessity of formal teacher training within medical education.   We can all recall personal examples of outstanding medical teaching that we have received in a variety of different clinical settings; from the patient’s bedside on a ward round to standing next to the surgeon in theatre, and from the outpatient clinic to primary care. So, as Jackson mentions, one could utilise the knowledge gained from these past experiences to guide us in our own teaching roles (1).   However, applying educational theory in the clinical arena is often easier said than done. Outlined below are some practical tips that may assist the newly qualified junior doctor in helping his students get the most out of their teaching session:   •Time devoted to clinical educational activity in hospitals is often variable or even absent, ranging from 0 – 25% of students’ time spent on the wards (2). So junior doctors would greatly improve the learning experiences of their students simply by trying to find more time to teach them. Realistically, however, not all the material may be covered in a time-constraint teaching session, so providing a summary handout or pointing to areas of further reading would be useful.   •Failure to utilise the assets of the clinical environment is commonplace. Many doctors revert towards didactic impartment of factual knowledge best left in the lecture theatre or seminar room, thereby losing the clinical context for teaching skills of history taking and examination. This is reflected in a study on teaching rounds, where only 11% of the time was spent at the patient’s bedside, the rest of the time being spent in the conference room or discussing in hallways (3). This is particularly surprising when bedside teaching and medical clerking are considered the most valuable teaching methods amongst both students and practicing doctors (4).   •Interruptions on the ward (e.g. being bleeped when on-call, restricted times for patients at mealtimes and during visiting hours) should be taken into account so as to minimise the disruption to bedside teaching arrangements.   •Be prepared to be opportunistic in clinical teaching, since cases never occur in a logical order.   •Set clear learning goals. Discuss objectives with learners to avoid covering topics they have already met; especially since medical students, even within the same medical school, will have had completely different learning experiences (5). This also enables learners to point out areas of weakness and to help them focus on the salient points of the lesson. At the end, review the aims, clarify any misunderstandings and summarise the key information.   •The motivation of learners can be difficult to maintain at times. Simple ways of achieving this include varying the teaching stimulus (e.g. mixing up the teaching of practical skills with recall of medical knowledge) and utilising tasks that are more engaging and interactive (e.g. bedside detective work and games for teaching physical examination (6)). Moreover, it has been shown that one of the features of good clinical teaching is enabling the student to be an active participant (7); so a good teacher would involve the students on the ward round by getting them to write in the patient notes, take a patient’s blood and getting them to listen to the heart sounds before the consultant does.   •A good teacher would frequently ask relevant open questions, avoid answering his own questions, and question the answers of his students (8).   •Giving personal feedback is an important factor in student satisfaction (9). So spend time supervising their physical examinations and reviewing their histories.   Medicine is different to other professions, in that teaching, whether it be to students, fellow doctors or other healthcare professionals, is an expectation. Furthermore, the General Medical Council state that those involved in teaching should “develop the skills, attitudes and practices of a competent teacher” (10). However, few doctors have had any formal training in educational method, though many express an interest in receiving it (11). Thus, there is a need for recognised training on how to teach within the medical curriculum. This has been acknowledged in recent years with some medical schools offering Special Study Modules in teaching, as well as assessing medical students on a given teaching performance to peers; therefore helping them to be more confident in teaching when they qualify. Postgraduate qualifications in medical education and teacher training courses also exist for those wishing to further their skills; however, only 6% of actively teaching doctors have ever attended masters or other short courses on teaching (12).    Patient-centred medicine to student-centred teaching seems a simple enough transition to make, but many find it a daunting prospect. So adequate training in educational methods should be in place for anyone who takes a keen interest in their teaching roles. However, being a good clinical teacher often goes beyond the theoretical teaching methods, and is characterised by being enthusiastic, inspiring and supportive (13).   References:   (1) Jackson P.

Her account represents many junior doctor’s difficulties with teaching (which included myself).  We go from being ‘learners’ as medical students straight to teachers when we get our MBBS.  Most of us had very didactic ‘product model’ of teaching (2) which sees knowledge residing in the teacher, teacher as expert and puts the learner in the passive role.  How do junior doctors then teach medical students when they themselves are still early in their training and learning on the job?  It is obvious to all that their knowledge can never be the same as a senior clinician.   The answer is two-fold – one to have a more collaborative way of teaching which sees ‘education as a process’ (2) where the teacher promotes the learner to gain the knowledge themselves and ideally puts the teacher role as facilitator.  This encourages the learner to take more responsibility for their learning and to be more involved.  Secondly being a doctor is not just about learning set knowledge and skills but is about professional practice (3) which focuses on attitudes, values and beliefs. This wider view of medical education aids the junior doctor’s role as teacher where one can role model being a professional which includes understanding individual patient context when making clinical decisions, how one’s own perceptions and attitude affect clinical judgment and how to adapt what’s learnt in the textbook to clinical practice.     This in itself is not easy and requires experience and training which goes back to the question the author asks about the necessity of formal training.  I believe that some formal training in learning how to teach is important.  Most deaneries I would imagine offer some learning to teach programme which I would encourage junior doctors to attend.  This would start the journey on learning more skills and tools on how to teach as a doctor with more confidence.  This arguably would be a minimal requirement and if one is enthusiastic could then be followed up by a postgraduate qualification.       Teaching is a fundamental part of being a doctor and the GMC is quite clear about the role of doctors as teachers and states as “doctors we have a professional obligation to contribute to the education and training” (4). It goes on to say we are responsible for the acquisition of these skills.   One wouldn’t expect a junior doctor to carry out a procedure without training, and I believe the same argument could and should be said of teaching.  We are don’t forget teaching the doctors of the future.       References   1.Jackson, P. Learning to Teach.
