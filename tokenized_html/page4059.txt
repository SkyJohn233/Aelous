t won the world series since 1988 the dodgers and red sox have met once before in the world series back in 1916 with boston beating brooklyn behind a big game from pitcher babe ruth kenley jansen tossed 1 1/3 scoreless innings before yielding to kershaw in the ninth the three-time cy young award winner pitching on two days of rest after starting game 5 finished off the brewers by striking out mike moustakas in a perfect ninth kershaw s teammates mobbed the lefty near the mound after the final out and the celebration was just beginning for the dodgers i m just so proud of our guys for enduring this roller coaster of a season manager dave roberts said what a surge for a team that was 10 games under .500 on may 16 the dodgers have talked about having unfinished business after losing game 7 of the world series last year to the houston astros now they ve made baseball s final series of the year in back-to-back seasons for the first time since 1977-78 i know how lucky i am to be a part of it two years in a row bellinger said with their 23rd pennant the dodgers have matched the rival giants for most among nl teams the brewers had their chances against rookie starter walker buehler a 24-year-old right-hander who navigated through trouble over 4 2/3 innings he allowed six hits including a home run in the first by yelich that made it 1-0 yelich looked like he would hurt the dodgers again in the fifth with lorenzo cain on second with two outs the nl mvp candidate hit a high hard liner to left that seemed destined to fall in for a double running at full speed to his left taylor extended his glove high in the air just as the ball settled into the mitt to end the inning they made the plays they made the pitches when they had to make to win yelich said after hader the dodgers waited for lights-out lefty josh hader to leave the game to get their bats going again brewers manager craig counsell brought in hader in the third after starter jhoulys chacin allowed a two-run homer to bellinger in the second for a 2-1 lead for the dodgers hader tossed three shutout innings striking out four before being pulled after 31 pitches milwaukee s vaunted bullpen then scuffled in the sixth puig s three-run shot off reliever jeremy jeffress quieted the breathless screaming brewers fans at miller park puig had been hitless in his previous five at-bats against jeffress striking out each time power packed the excitable puig raised both arms as he rounded second wiggling his fingers skyward to mimic the brewers trademark celebration move manny machado the object of nonstop boos from milwaukee fans obliged with the same gesture as he watched from the dugout steps bellinger raised his right arm and pointed to his biceps as he rounded third after his homer the mighty dodgers who hit an nl-best 235 homers outslugged the brewers who were second in the league with 218 what a catch taylor said that it was so loud in the outfield that trying to communicate with bellinger in centre while tracking yelich s liner in the gap in the fifth was difficult it was about reacting at that point taylor said a lefty hits it in the gap it kind of tails you really don t know how much that ball is going to tail so really it s just a reaction play he said looking forward the loss ended a remarkable year for the brewers a late surge led by yelich lifted milwaukee from 5 1/2 games out of the nl central lead on aug. 28 to one win short of the franchise s second world series appearance they took us on an amazing journey counsell said about his team it was a magical run an american league team in 1982 the brewers lost the series in seven games that year to the st. louis cardinals game 7 against the dodgers was the first at home for the franchise coming 36 years to the day after losing the seventh game to the cardinals in the series same result on saturday with yelich and first baseman jesus aguilar emerging as offensive cornerstones along with a deep well of young pitching in the majors the brewers figure to contend again in 2019 they ll have to dethrone the dodgers we were right there jeffress said i think the biggest thing we take from this is we have all the pieces next year we just have to put it together better than we did today 8 c light rain feels like 7 c we encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and
