ranking was calculated alum xa0 i like the studying atmosphere and the rigor this is a very ambitious school the one thing i wish they would improve is their mental health awareness i also wish that more teachers/counselors could promote identity outside of academic success such as success as an artist a chef and/or just a housewife even read 410 reviews junior xa0 when i came to northview i couldn t speak english very well but they have a special class for esol student and there are some benefits for them for example in the history classes we have a teacher that help us to understand the chapter better and explains everything that we don t understand in general all the teachers are nice and they explains everything to us slowly so that we can understand also the counselor helps me a lot she told me about the graduation requirement and how i can get to the good colleges also northview has a lot of clubs i personally join to the chess club and they registered us for the tournaments northview gave us each chromebook which make our job a lot easier we don t have to carry a lot of book with ourselves and all the books are available online at the end i love going to school when my is school is northview read 583 reviews sophomore xa0 i am currently a sophomore here although the academics are extremely challenging especially for taking all honors classes i know i x2019 m actually learning something in life new school is cool academics and athletics are great and it is nice to know we go to one of the hardest schools/best schools in the state and even top in the country usaworldreport 2018 ranked us 160 out of 17000 high schools in the country read 479 reviews senior xa0 alpharetta high school is a place with lots of diversity and strengths in all areas of

read 444 reviews senior xa0 lambert is a great high school if you stay with the right crowd being involved in clubs and the different pathways such as business engineering healthcare i x2019 m with that one etc is great the opportunities that are provided are great i x2019 ll be interning at s hospital next year so as long as you stay with the right people it x2019 s a great school read 531 reviews senior xa0 i like chattahoochee high school s cultural environment our school is know for being the school of heart in our area though we do have lots of competition specifically in academics we have the most school spirit out of all the schools in our area and are taught compassion and kindness everyone in our school is expected to respect one another and show friendship and stellar character one thing i would like to see change in our school however is the resources we are given to excel in academics read 525 reviews senior xa0 south forsyth high school is amazing with their students and education teachers and staff care so much about the students and there are many teachers that any students can ask help for and they will always be there for you south is very diverse and everyone is treated equally with care and we all support each other in any help one thing i absolutely love about south is the many opportunities and experience students get to have we have amazing field trips if you re in deca for example going of out state and also for foreign language there are a lot of amazing field trips like going to paris or spain the one thing i would change about south is the school spirit i believe that school spirit should be expressed in every event and not only football there should be school spirit in pep rallys soccer games basketball games baseball/softball games plays etc overall i m lucking enough to attend south forsyth high school and get the best high school experience read 542 reviews junior xa0 north gwinnett high school is a place where i feel safe and free to be myself i strongly believe that i am getting the best education that i can possibly get here at north simply because the teachers here are committed to helping their student to not just simply pass/graduate high school but to make a difference in their students x2019 lives for the better one thing that i love about this school is the amount of diversity here there are people of all sorts of racial mixes unique ethnicities and the best part is that they all come from different backgrounds that somehow bring people closer together too however i gave nghs four stars only because not everywhere is a perfect place and that things may happen out of the convenience of other people at the school the large amount of school spirit here at nghs is phenomenal in which everyone participates and supports each other which is what being a true nghs bulldog means read 809 reviews alum xa0 i loved how engaging the staff and students are and there really is something there for everyone they don t focus on sports like many other school do and they provide many activities and extracurriculars there they have amazing debate math lacrosse volleyball and golf teams they also have wonderful clubs for people who enjoy languages art theater music science and other things overall it was amazing and i really enjoyed my time there read 732 reviews senior xa0 overall my hs expirence was very good here i went to jchs for all 4 years of hs and the environment was very conducive to learning and accelerating your studies i was able to take very challenging classes that most schools don x2019 t offer most of the teachers were great and very helpful if you put in effort towards the classes the school sets up students to succeed in classes however the school could improve in its personalization to the students since the school is very large one on one advice and attention from teachers administrators and councilors is very limited read 390 reviews niche user xa0 the teachers at the school are mostly good and very professional they connect with the students very well and a lot offer help to the students the school is overall clean organized and looks nice the school is relatively new and very progressive the administration of the school try to improve the way kids learn and support them in getting through high school there are a lot of different clubs the school offers ap classes honors classes student may sign up to be a mentor in a class to help out teachers and students school also tries their best to focus on athletics and encourage physical exercise and health however the food at the cafeteria is mostly not a very good quality however i think it is an issue in a lot of schools the school also offers a lot of different unique classes such as british literature latin on all levels even a movie class for those interested in directing or filming overall the school has a lot of good qualities but could improve read 134 reviews senior xa0 milton is a great school filled with academically excelling students and teachers/administrators who actually care for your well-being the sports and arts are terrific the cirque program is ranked at the top in the nation and many of our sports are state champions or ranked at the top of the state there are numerous club at school so you will definitely be able to find what you enjoy if not it is easy to start your own club too however the school culture absolutely sucks with a plethora of stuck-up materialistic children feeding off their parents wealth along with this around 50 of these students do drugs or vape blatantly in front of teachers in lower level classes read 435 reviews senior xa0 brookwood is different from any other school i ve heard compared to the gwinnett district what i love about this school is the endless opportunities they offer they provide many clubs and academics especially the aps they work every year to improve their school for the comfort of students the school has shown off their records and not afraid to show their trophy display which is kind of obnoxious but impressive to say the least additionally administration can be both professional and friendly they do what s best for students while befriends them at the same time brookwood is also known for their football the students here have crazy spirit i ve never seen anything like it the stadiums would be packed on those friday nights people would skip doing their homework or any other activity just to attend their games the support is unreal here go broncos read 1,006 reviews alum xa0 mcintosh was an incredible preparation for the realistic amount of work-load and real-world experiences that college will bring the rigorous courses provided were indeed a plus the opportunities available to partake in multiple types of dual-enrollment and ap courses were great i would highly recommend this school in all honesty for realistic exceptions of life in college and superb academics read 369 reviews senior xa0 opportunity diversity inclusion and rigorous academics describe chamblee charter high school since 9th grade i have strived to compete with classmates form varying backgrounds and claim my place in bulldog history in additional to competition our teachers promote inclusion and collaboration thorough my experiences i know that one day i will become a self-sufficient productive member of society the only change i would make about my school would be to provide more access to students who are not able to attend due to the attendance lottery all students deserve an opportunity for great teaching and learning read 543 reviews senior xa0 roswell has been a great school overall the three biggest problems are drug use poor restrooms despite the renovation and low levels of club participation in recent years the students have started vaping in bathrooms throughout the school day there aren t enough female cafeteria monitors so admin has decided to just lock the cafeteria bathrooms completely speaking of bathrooms a few of the female restrooms don t have trashcans in them so the bathrooms have gotten just as disgusting as they were before the renovation in just a few months clubs also usually just fizzle out after a couple of meetings students aren t interested or just don t care despite these issues the school is generally a great place with helpful teachers awesome athletic teams and arts programs and lots of encouragement from faculty and staff to improve the school read 448 reviews junior xa0 over my two years i have completed in buford high school i have not encountered a single thing i did not simply love so far all of my teachers have treated me with upmost respect and have been there to help me in any area that i need not only are the academics amazing but i am involved in high school baseball and the athletics department are to die for as they say at buford x201c triple a excellence academics atheletics and arts x201d until i reached my freshman year i did not understand how accurate this statement was overall i have loved my experiences at buford high school so far and can x2019 t wait to see what the future has to offer read 230 reviews senior xa0 lassiter high school is a wonderful school there are copious amounts of opportunities for students of all kind whether one has a learning disability special needs or the just the average student lassiter caters to all student needs from pep rallies to every club you can think of lassiter has it lol languages of lassiter is a club for all students to learn and engulf themselves into different cultures through food this is just one of many inclusive clubs they offer gay-straight-alliance club deca nhs and more the faculty does a great job of helping students with different learning styles and offering help/study sessions read 492 reviews senior xa0 i love the culture at peachtree ridge high school it is extremely diversified compared to other schools in the county and there is a niche for every student our ap teachers prepare us well for exams as well as honors teachers with block scheduling we receive extra class time that others schools don t. thus we are better prepared for exams furthermore block scheduling allows students to focus only on four classes at a time as opposed to seven or eight i feel extremely safe at peachtree ridge the doors are locked at all times although our sports and food could be improved i m grateful that safety is always our administrators first priority although i m interested in the english pathway peachtree ridge offers an excellent stem pathway which features engineering i am honored be a student at such an innovative school read 820 reviews senior xa0 i am currently a senior at savannah arts and i love it i transferred in after freshman year and it was a super smooth and easy process all the teachers are amazing and super helpful the administration and counselors provide the best resources and help to make sure you succeed although a visual and performing arts school savannah arts is very academically challenging but provides a healthy competitive environment for its students the students are extremely progressive forward thinking and open minded savannah arts instills skills and lessons into it students that will help them throughout your life i am sad to leave but extremely excited to use what i learned here in my college career read 573 reviews senior xa0 decatur high school is a tight-knit community of hard-working students teachers administrators and staff everyone has their different interests passions and talents and they are all welcomed respected and encouraged at dhs the school s science olympiad team for example is an amazing opportunity for students interested in stem to learn more about fascinating real-world topics relating to stem dhs also offers a variety of quirky clubs from larping club to birdwatching club to telenovela club read 298 reviews senior xa0 davidson fine arts is a school where one can discover themselves within their studies their teachers and any of the various talents one possesses i x2019 ve attended davidson since the 6th grade and i am now a senior throughout my entire davidson life i can say that the staff and administration have our best interest they x2019 re constantly motivating us and improving the learning environments the school itself is a home to me because in every area of the school i have a confidant their academics are rigorous yet intriguing the teaching techniques in which each teacher has is what makes it such a unique and fulfilling experience there x2019 s no other school like davidson because at davidson everyone has a role and no matter one x2019 s individual goal the overall goal to achieve at the end of each day is the bettering of one another read 355 reviews alum xa0 dekalb school of the arts taught me how to plan effectively and utilize time management properly since dekalb school of the arts also has a unique arts program it forces you to have to learn how to balance both the high academic workload of a high-school and the devotion to practicing an artistic craft so overall i think dekalb school of the arts does prepare students well for life after high-school by requiring students to develop skills like patience discipline adaption communication skills and time management but one thing that dekalb school of the arts fails at is strengthening students academic weaknesses since the school is not as big as majority of the high schools in the state there should be more time put into personally helping out each student individually and helping them fill in the academic holes that have been left from previous school experience even though the school is an arts school there should be equal effort put into academics as well read 164 reviews senior xa0 parkview high school is an extremely preparing facility objectively one of the overall best high schools in the state of georgia a very large facility a relatively welcoming staff and plenty of different school cultures to get involved with most schools don x2019 t give you this feeling of wholesomeness that parkview does the grand scale of what it has to offer for its students make the surrounding schools pale in comparison.go view read 667 reviews senior xa0 wheeler high school is an outstanding school the teachers at wheeler high school are excellent they make sure no student is left behind in class and offer many different types of tutoring sessions.the students are all very uplifting to one another and wish success to all their peers the schools diversity teaches other students how to respect each others cultures race and religions the school even offers international night where the students get to try things from all over the world wheeler high school isn t like another school which is why i believe every student graduates with a knowledge on just about everything and is ready for the real world ahead of them read 422 reviews junior xa0 i love the sense of community and small class sizes town meetings every monday morning are really fun there s lots of time to do work like during conference and x-block advisories are a great way to make friends and talk to the same group of people for all four years freshman retreat is very fun the academics are challenging but if you re a motivated student it s very valuable read 68 reviews senior xa0 having been in public schools throughout middle school quarry lane has been a stellar eye-opening high school experience for me it has given me the opportunities to push myself academically and grow among intellectuals who also want to be successful individuals in their communities the faculty and teachers are really supportive from helping understand concepts in class to just being nice people to talk to about things outside of school such as movies music sports etc the smaller grade sizes have also allowed for lots of independent clubs to flourish students who are passionate about their goals can achieve almost anything they set their minds to at quarry lane thanks to the open minded and generous community here at quarry lane i have been able to explore numerous leadership positions in clubs while also building a solid educational foundation to prepare for college read 111 reviews
