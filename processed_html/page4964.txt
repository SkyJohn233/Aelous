Helpfully on time  It was a good flight My last business trip was atrocious with Delta; this experience has been great so far! On time, safe flight.  Smooth flight  All went well. No issues. Stanley Internstional Airport in Newburgh, NY should be awarded for its friendly and stress-free atmosphere! Everyone at the airport from the rental car employees to th e TSA staff to the airline personnel are so friendly, easygoing, and accomodating! These attitudes are often hard to find while traveling - one more reason why Stanley International is one of my favorite airports! Was missing free snacks Personnel in St. Thomas not especially friendly. Airport facility very sub standard. Not up to Delta excellent standard at other airports.  Thanks for your fine service.  The movie made the time fly by.
