Dragonlance - Krynn Reborn | The Neverwinter Vault   Some repeating dialogue after quest completion, but well put together otherwise.  The story, however, is pretty basic, like a beginner's quest. I like that story and scripting but on other hand it seems that the dialogs are not fulfillent with quest-line. I've already killed an elemental mage in Cave, got reward and on another conversation the Aasomeone tries to give me this quest again. Another thing are druids and their altar. I've grabbed the gobln head (which in fact was a hobgoblin neverthless) and gave it to druid's leader. Unfortunatelly it doesn't end the quest with forest purification. Finally I'm not able to pass the south bridge AreaTransition. It does nothing. I think it took me an half an hour to finish the story (20 minutes exactly). I like that the henchman has an inventory. My henchmans doesn't and I don't know why.
