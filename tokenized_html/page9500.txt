bbc stoke staffordshire entertainment northern soul show messages archive 2009 you are in stoke staffordshire entertainment music northern soul northern soul show messages archive 2009 you made your feelings known about mary fox 's soul show during the first half of 2009 and in such numbers that we have had to create extra archive pages we loved all the comments so much that we wrapped them up for posterity this is an archive of course but if you want to contribute to the current comments board just click on the 'northern soul link to the right on this page *** april 2009 october 2009 but it reads backwards so oldest comments at bottom of page mac mcnulty from chiang mai twiggy you ask a question re kev roberts being in a groups on top of the pops there was one person who i believe played keyboards in a group on totp 's i think it was chris king mary if you get a chance how about playing not me baby by the shilouettes for all those people working in the far flung corner 's of the world.cheers twiggy to potteries pecker i agree with you totally we do have a click locally who think this music is just for themselves to be honest with you i did n't see most who now regularly go onto the messaggeboard at any soul nites until marys show was aired on local radio stoke some 6 years ago they say they did that and this what gets me they turn up with boxes of pressings and think they have got original records in their cases i told one of um recently virtually every record in his collection was a pressing he laughed because he thought i was pulling his plonker.this weeks guest was very good with his selections proving you did n't have to go any big club to know the stuff one thing i must say is he stayed on for to long he got an hour which i think was not fair because hes already getting alot of airtime doing other things the scene i knew was all about humble kids nobody from the media wanted to listen to northern soul way back in time now we have experts from here and far telling us about their experiences with this music.soul-on-trent they say i dunna feel any soul when i go local nights so i pick the ones i go to but to be honest something always seems missing cravat soul now is all i want to talk about where the bloody record dealers who dj on our scene and hog it can play politics with themselves i guess airplay of a true original 45 which is rare will push up its value like the guest on this weeks show said you buy an antique because you love it and want it and you most probably wo n't make a bean on it i guess its a different story with record dealer dj 's who hog the scene ya getting to be a sad lot between yourselves ya ruined the scene once and alot of the donkey work was done by others so pecker a little togetherness you say no chance they onna worth it adrian mcintosh cant wait 4 you r northen soul tunes tonight known as soul stomper eric what a star mary just listened to the 23/10/09 show.please get e.k.back asap we really

artist and title thanks for your help broadway- boogie-woogie de stijl hi mary.b/stoke/ soul .some good sound s on ya show by-eck .a good listen .i was surfin ya station found a music subculture that has zest .good stuff b/stoke .regard s piet mondrian aka sqare-dutch with balsam rob cadiz late friday night two classics to start the show on a good foot ive been sliding around my various houses depending on point in life your talking about to mitch ryder the detoit wheels since i was an 11 year old boy god it never gets old in my ignorance pre-internet i suppose for years i thought mitch ryder was a black soul singer it just goes to show that blue eyed soul if done well can be easily as good as the soul i generally think of black detroit chicargo etc etc and love cherish and buy mary 's style suits the show perfectly in my opinion laid back sounding and importantly open to all and any requests ive listened to nearly all the soul shows i can find on the internet and some very good ones of course in amongst them and some play as good music but none of the shows has the same feel to it and thats largely down to the broadcasting style of mary goldie has said it many times on this board the guests and the sheer variation of soul styles played sticking to a roughly 70 out and out northern and mixing up the other 30 it works .and of course the well informed msgb folk ive met talked to so many bulshi***** s over the years that its a real pleasure to communicate with people who love soul and generally care about other folk at least to a point which is normal as the family outweighs everything else if your lucky time for a large tinto de verano back in a few mins ..ahhhh thats better now where was i oh yeah anyone going to the dec 28th alldayer at the riverside near southport featuring the one the only wheel legend mr pete roberts .i cant believe this venue is happening less than a mile from the house of my folks..and im home at xmas..what a result the isleys have got to be one of the best bands ive ever had the pleasure of listening to no wonder your wriggling in your chair mary .oh how i wish i 'd seen them live .anyone got any isleys live experiences to share i think ronald isley is in jail to this day on tax evasion offences lets hope he 's still getting his royalities and his life is made better by his genius at least affording him a decent trickle of cash until he 's a free man another few uears if im not mistaken i dont watch coronation street great that soul was featured on the show .is someone in the production team a soul fan .but i admit i used to love it when ever ive lived in the uk its more humorous than its rivals .we all grew up with it .. i 've even got a really good reggae track of the theme tune on tape somewhere in my parents loft .its a comforting song for me hows about playing johnny howard the chase is on a funky stormer of a song that can not fail to get you movin you can get this track in ian edwards cin cd the best few quid you 'll spend in a long time cheers rob david case please tell phil sawyer from ormskirk dave case 's email is jjbarnes googlemail.com and i would love to hear from him david william bell hi

maryplease could you play looking for love by kirk franklin or smile by neo for my other half phil please wish him a happy birthday for thursday n tell him i love him loads.we always listen in whilst we get redy to go out.thanx mary ktf x twiggy to the soul police listen the days of old have gone except it theres no torch nomore no wigan casino and no mecca ya keeping the youngsters away from the scene yes some kids are picking up on bits and bobs on the music score but i just wonder is this because of the pushy parent thing i know many who once had a name on the scene and they dunna want to loose that thing it was a pair of old decks i brought off a local dealer and i was stitched up good time anyway my alba surround system knocked spots off the old disco decks cravat soul is the way forward for me and i wunna let people like you grind me down i would love to meet you but i guess you will be hiding behind somebody its easy for people like you not to face the facts the sound system in the kingshall needs up dating most who went the last kingshall allnighter we attended not working like some who keep making that excuse the old kingshall soul nites kingspin had at most a couple of hundred in them the music played then way back was similar but not the same there was alot of stuff spun that later was played at wigan to be honest even for the diehards some records have been overplayed.the wheel is a place where you must go and listen to tunes that were made for that building the arches and sound system work very well ya brought drugs into the argument let me tell you this my friend if you get hooked on the wrong stuff its a downhill path in life the bali hi will always be my favourite soul nite or club call it what ever alot of my friends who were into soul music had problems with the stuff some onna with us nomore but travelled everwhere when the soul scene had its finest hour i 'll leave it on this one the main reason you dunna want people to hear other stuff is because it will mean you wunna have the say nomore i wunna let somebody who hides behind a pack of hyenea 's try to grind me down you have got no chance of that but at least you say you are local and you finally have started to tell us who you really are and been up to over the years i call you jealous but envyist is perhaps the word that fits better i have a very good selection of tunes and will always move on a bit with the stuff until it starts to bore me keep going to listen to the one trick ponies my moneys staying in my pocket.oh one last one i went trentham and pete schofield got the place packed out until they messed it all up like the know alls like you do dave ktf to martin track your after could be joi cardwell 'let it go i 've only got it on a soul in the sun cd

love it goldiexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx grrrhhhh twiggy so the soul police are at work here goodnite all or is that evening all i know about the difficulty bird brain with the music system thats why i 'm saying it read in to what i 'm saying yes i do know about the drugs thing ya get that in every music scene anna you been watching the tele recently its in the eyes yes sadly my dog and my missis makes me watch the x-facter digital technology is the way forward and ya wunna stop it if the people who run the kingshall and i do n't mean mr roberts ya pillack i mean the lease holders put a half decent system meaning surround system in it would be magical now it would n't take me long to guess whos on the other end of this message but it sounds like a nice little earner to you the disco system as gone never had one problem what so ever filling a pub but it inner about me its about the music my dear some are stuck in time trying to bring something back what they will never be able to surely you must have heard some of the bad vinyl that some have duplicated and sent in to mary the sound quality is lost yes i 'm afraid to say it i must have been issed when i went wigan but travelling ai n't my thing the pub you mentioned in the 80 's was as long as the kingshall not quite as wide and queues formed outside for miles and got no desire to repeat well a couple of hundred yards no never been the wheel or the ritz wigan trentham or even the mecca sorry i did visit the mecca twice infact these times have gone except it ya like a randy old dog who thinks hes got one last jump in himself.my ears are still ringing because the sound system was to loud now't wrong with the djs i asked mr roberts once was he the one playing a piano once on top of the pops in a group called shakatak or something like that he said it wan na him but someone else who knows him said it was i would love to know whos telling me the truth because from that day to this i have always said the guy wan na playing the instrument best of luck to anybody whos trying to make a quid or two but £15.00 quid each to get in and listen to muffled music just inner going to happen again for me i want quality thanks by the way i have never touched a drug only the amber nectar i guess its me outta touch with everything ya got ta take this and that have ya i do n't think so.not interested in going where the incrowd goes one last thing about the scene before any clubs we all know soul music was emerging so what makes them the experts i know people who have vasts amount of soul records and never been a soul nite and that includes any of the clubs but he would leave alot of the experts years behind with his knowledge he as got ya will always get the banter i 'm trying to improve the scene perhaps get a few more ladys interested in turning up i have spent thousands on finding other stuff to hear i was never going to except that artists i loved growing up were one trick ponies so i found the stuff that suits me i have got cd 's now 30 years old so work it out for yourself me or the great pretenders who anna got really any interest in soul music its just another way of promoting their egos and a way of earning a quick buck whats the point in releasing soul compilation cd 's of other stuff the artists have recorded only to find out if it wan na on a 45 then ya conna play it sounds two faced to me we must be allowed to listen or have the chance to decide now whats wrong with that.evening all see ya at the kingshall ozzy sue from stafford hi ian good choices listened in the sun dould you keep me a cd please i will get in touch on my return have a great night i will be thinking of u all x petesco www.the soulguy.com mick oliver i just played supertime on my october show..go to www.the soulguy.com scroll down the page to the october shows ,you cant miss mine ,i 'm the one sitting on the toilet with my laptop ,i kid you not..there are 60 odd shows in the archive plus loads of soulful info ,and pictures galore.plus join in the debate is there another generation left in northern soul ..over 100 posts so far www.the soulguy.com..thankyou..petesco..k a t b now..x.. eve ninnall twiggy bin an all-nighter at the kings recently bin anywhere recently the kings is a big venue with difficult acoustics for recorded music anybody who has been involved with promoting gigs at large venues not specifically designed for it knows that but you with your expertise at playing music in sum back-street pub in newcastle in '1980sumthin in ya brain packin em in yeh rite lol wud know all about it let 's face it you never went the wheel never went the torch and according to you were so p***8d you could n't remember going to wigan but you appear on photographs outside you were there ha i know people who were 'chemically wasted at wigan but can too this day remember bein there so its easy to put the countrys leading all-nighter on at the kings so easy to critise thats why hundreds of people travel to it from all over ask kev roberts about the risks and difficulties involved and do n't knock him cus he is a soul man love him or hate him you do n't go anywhere and blame it on a multitude of things dj 's venues music blah blah i seem to remember a number of people offering you the chance to spin at gigs on this very site but we all still wait perhaps a problem with ya famous twin-deck tape player huh get off ya pc and get out more and stop relying on info you obviously get from some older family member cuz brother you were n't there when you say you was look forward to seein you at a northern soul gig soon saturday nights are out cuz you watch x factor and then admit it on this site i go to loads of events locally around stoke and around the country and i know you but i never see you cravat movement my a**e why all the interest in stoke well if you dunna know the answer to that it confirms it you wan na there and guess what surprise suprise ya still ai n't and people on the site reply to you as if you know stuff the only problem the northern soul scene has ever had is people like you and with modern technology you are now able to voice your 'ramblings to a wider audience rob cadiz can anyone tell me if there is a twisted wheel sunday session on jan 3rd 2010 or indeed any wheel night within a few days of the above date i have to be back in spain on jan 6th rob mik oliver hi mary went to see dancing in the street last week absolutely brilliant to all soulies who havent yet seen it you dont know what youre missing.hey have you managed to locate super

life in canada on the 19th october.we attend the soul venues mainly together so i will miss his great dancing and company.one of his all time favourites is time will pass you by -dobbie gray.if you could play this for him it would be a nice farewel present twiggy to rufus i think it would take a hundred life times to know all the stuff soul recordings at least identify yourself but hey met your kinds throughout my life there are hundreds of sites where you can obtain soul records my problem with some are this they are to pricey or asking to much for a record that they may have purchased out of a soul pack for peanuts what i canna get a mate would most probably have thats how mates work mary eloise laws what can i say absolute killer tune more cravat soul and i 'm a happy bunny port vale

dancin to the orginal in 1971 well we like it anyway.carnt get my hands on that magicians 45 anywhere 'deadends everywhere anybody out there help me out pretty please another item i picked up on my recent visit to the uk.been after it for a while.long after the night is all over by irma thomas.great version of the jr classic.when you get space please give it a spin.good number to close the show one week well back to the murcians they smell a bit 'goaty i will have to 'hose them down they are all busy getting the grapes in for next years vino tinto.ktf jinksy and the murcians rufus not leaking to twiggyyou have now proved to me that you should have been a comedian instead because when it comes to northern soul or where to get records or cds even djin just like the television advert we all know you know jack mr fool ryan hall tunstall next sat torch reunion 350 tickets all sold out all the regulars from all over the country who went to the torch and supported the djs venue will meet again pity that the george hotel burslem has to be put on the same night and hide under a charity night yet again talk about polotics talk about sour grapes rob cadiz jinksy john shaft great arrangement and wa wa guitar but i prefer ih 's vocals funkier even though the lyrics are far clearer in the sd version nice bit of variety for the show good choice mate rob rob cadiz the four pros just another girl is a storming track that has me dancing in the kitchen bathroom living room and just about anywhere you could swing a rat a simply brilliant track .as with loads of the the other ones on the cin cd ive had the cin cd on my cd player all week and its superb ..nice one mr edwards good luck with the whole cin thing a great effort mate a special thanks to all the djs and soul fans listed on the cd for their selections and the great gesture of giving up their time for free time for a long long long g t. rob sylvia dean a great show this week.. and to jinksy in mercia.. a debate ensued in our household i hated the remix of the isaac hayes track joe liked the sammy davis remix but personally i always believe.. that if a song is good first time around as is the passion which comes through on the original shaft tune .why remix .. why re-invent the wheel as it were. but now there is a debate ktf xxx martin and jackie the sdj tune brilliant piece of music by isaac but this version is wrong wrong wrong but good on ya for giving it a spin do n't know until we try it great show loved ruby andrews can you play she l come runnin back mel britt for me love you for ever if you do guy hi mary love the show been listenin on the net for about 18 months now keep up the good work dave and ruth in rugeley hi mary and to all our brothers and sisters out in the world of northern

northern soul rare motown night at wolverley memorial hall on shatterford rd wolverley nr kidderminster on saturday 7th november now in it s second year large wooden sprung dancefloor great atmosphere loads of free parking 8.30pm 1.30am £4 otd ta shaun adrian mcintosh love yur show.i live in bangor north wales and have loved n soul all my life.i am 46yrs young haha please can u give me a mention ps missed kings hall allnighter on sat had 2work xx little anthony wsp message for ian edwards.the soul police are all primed and listening in mate see you at cin ian alford anyone help please was there a instrumental track called the horse i 've got a track king of the horse but i seem to remember the horse for some reason .cheers k.t.f.. twiggy to rufus leaking hey my mate my roof inner leaking if the kingshall ever mastered the sound system there would be no competion of anywhere holding a soul nite that could match it fantastic dancefloor which is massive unlike some places where you can get 6 on the dancefloor and say its packed theres a bit of tongue and cheek there somewhere but so what hey 3 of my heros those comedians dunna tell me theres anybody about now that could lace any of their boots up the cravat soul movement will be the future of soul music as far as i 'm concerned tunes will be played what the pecking order merchants dunna want you to play um you know the score on that one the youngsters love quality tunes and they soon pick up on um what is the cravat soul scene its where theres no music politics within soul music where finer selections will filter in with the northern stuff perhaps a better dress code because i think some soul nites are losing the dress code thing one thing i dunna like when i go a soul nite is hearing what seems to be one long record that trys to go faster than the hundred mile an hour stuff meaning one keeps putting the same kind of beaty tune after another not giving the dancers anytime to relax and chill out a bit some soul nites when you look at the dancers they dance to every tune virtually come on they all onna that good the tunes let me say this alot who dj on the northern scene would n't know the northern scene locally in stoke so why all the interest in stoke what i 'm trying to say most of the tunes that get spun locally were n't the tunes i grew up listening too and most of the spinners were spinning the tunes in stafford or mecca and wigan it slowly died a death the scene did big cheifs grew up and were getting married and virtually left the scene feeling empty all that knowledge of the stuff did n't do um any good until the recent revival what i 'm trying to say they just picked up where they left the scene some 30 years previously because they smelt the coffee and some are just draining the scene dry bleeding every penny they can get without letting the scene breathe and progress a bit for me this music deserves to be heard on better sound systems i think the days of blasting the stuff out on 2 bloody big speakers and base bins have gone a nice surround system should be fitted in most places after all they charge you a arm and a leg to hire a venue if you play an old 45 to loundly on a disco system it sounds muffled and you can hardly make out what the record is thats my gripe now whats the point in ramming people in a place and ya conna hear the stuff because of the muffyiness the sound quality is lost because of the volume of people in the venue who ever runs the kingshall venue in stoke should take note put a better system in the house its a great venue joan alzheimer 's charity night stop press 2 thanks to the support and generousity of warrior clothing there will be an opportunity to take home some classy and/or retro soulie/mod gear in return for a donation to the cause do

goldie u can do it mate just 7 little days its sunday wheel time 11 th oct 3pm -8pm a lady godiva on de door yipeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee todays track at the twisted wheel by chubby goldstein xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx grrrhhh twiggy this weeks guest showed um how its done for me he even admitted these are not perhaps his favs but showed the class with his selections he even told us about his love of his life hey i know what he ment when he said she did me a favour he showed passion nick as finally come out of the early 60 's with a little progressiveness but soon tended to go back i feel the sick bucket is being passed around to freely at soul nites when it comes to dj 's for me you just conna turn up with a box of records like some are doing and call themselves northern soul djs especially when some dunna even except there was a northern soul scene sorry to say there was so what is a northern soul dj this i asked myself it left me thinking that he would or she would be no older than say 55ish even that just might be to old because the proper northern scene was kicking in around 1968 and only lasting till wigan closed its doors what is a northern tune in my opinion its done by any singer or groups from any back ground and if it touches you then thats soul enough and as very uptempo beat to it the hundred mile an hour stuff a soul dj is a completely different animal for me he started years before in another scene from the northern scene maybe the blues scene there was a motown scene and a stax scene or let me put it another way people who liked one or the other infact many other labels you can say had their own identity atlantic philly stuck out a mile from other stuff in the soul movement what gets me is this what do they mean by the classics when they play say about a few hundred tunes between themselves when there are many many thousands of records to be played that could easily fill any dancefloor one that comes to mind is tears by gloria shannon to use as an example there will be no tears from me when it all starts to go wrong seen it all happen before the saturation point and the monopoly thing as to stop so other styles can come through i 'm not putting my name forward but some ought to take a long hard look in the mirror do they love themselves indeed they do let the world have a listen to the great underground tunes we know are there because i feel these little get togethers for only the few onna doing the music any favours and we all are getting older i dunna know anybody whos getting younger and if anybody does let me know i hope a new scene happens and i would call it the cravat soul scene or progressive soul scene where you can play any record from any period from the soul movement thing i know i will get my ears bashed but hey i have had my thousand laughs any chance mary playing a thousand laughs by the great eloise laws dave in rugeley hi mary how you doing we look forward to your show every week we would like to say hi to roy sandra karl and tom we all had a great night last saturday up the peartree club in the capable hands of vic sutton played some cracking records as

enjoyed the show last week the r b tracks included plus that supremes track could you please play a memory from wigan casino love desire by patrice holloway ..cheers tony rob cadiz happy birthday for last week el twigg hombre rob rob cadiz enjoyed the ian levine produced track waterfall and if nobody would have told me it was a il creation i would have been singing its praises as the soul-o-meter had my foot tappin a good pace so fair play to mr levine on this ocasion it sounded like it had a far less tinny computerised sound to it it seemed to have that all important more authentic musician generated beat to it i might be wide of the mark but thats what it sounded like to my ears homer banks 60 minutes is an all time classic love it interesting stat that 50 of the playlist if listener generated thats what keeps the show so fresh its that variety of tastes from popular to rare that gives the show its edge and it really works enjoyed jeff´s guests first track definitely had a catchy very danceable rnb/ska beat to it love that rnb stuff the guest really did treat us to something a bit different and highly enjoyable it was he talked a lot of sense too about breaking new sounds could you please play fred hughes-dont let me down a crackin piece of soul from the arkansas born but vee-jay and brunswick artist rob keith haylett i have been in australia since 1992 and used to go to al the alnighters in the seventies and thought northern soul had died how wrong could i be love the sounds last week i have a request could you play you ready now by frankie vallie or fever by the prophets much appreciated and will keep listening francis t thanks mary for playing hit and run for me last week.my mate david yeats seems to have a way with words i am surprised he did not ask for run for cover by the dells.heard you did a tribute to my long standing friend chris savory a very sad loss.francis t brian smith from south manchester to geoff/jeff studio guest on friday 18 september barry tasker was not an original dj at the twisted wheel club in the 1960 's but he was a well known face there he dj 's at the wheel now because he is a good personal friend of pete roberts barry tasker is a good soul dj and without doubt got an excellent pedigree and went on to dj at the pendulum soul club in manchester when the wheel closed its doors in 71 in fact barry tasker is one of the guest dj 's on at the wheel allnighter this friday night mary could i take the oppertunity to thank and take my hat off to pete roberts for reopening the wheel and making the 1000 's of people who have passed through the wheel over the last 9 years so very happy regards brian poison-'ivy manchester hi mary.please don t change the 'intro'track of your show 'all for you earl-van-dyke it s a track

the summer of 69 those were the best days of my life it was the the big 6 week school holiday long hot sunny days starting going to small local discos mini skirts maxi coats fluffy belly jumpers that showed your midriff fred perry t shirts levie jeans shrinking in the bath white plastic boots that you pulled up like socks and yes i had a pvc coat mine was green got into my first gang and we would be together all of us every day and night through the holidays boys yes real boys as well as girls the lads had chopper style bikes which we would beg a a ride on before they progressed onto scooters and they all wore parkas that we would beg for them to let us wear but it was all about the music these older lads got me into soul music and motown that has stayed with me for ever all the songs you played in your feature bought smiles to my face we would each carry round with us our own 45 's in a plastic bag like a trophy and hang out at various freinds houses and unbeknown to our parents who were out at work we would play our very scratched 45 's i had a danset record player oohh so very cool didnt have much money for buying records so would beg or borrow a lot of them i always remember my best freind buying my cheri amour stevie wonder i was so jelous as it was my favorite and still is we would hang out in the sun down at the local cut canal and the lads would go swimming and we would watch it dont bear thinking about now does it if ever me mother had known and we go to chasewater fair in brownhills west midlands on the waltzers and get the lads to whiz us round whilst the sounds of motown was bellowing out the music from that time was the best ever and it still is i made a lot of friends at that time many are still best freinds today if you can mary would you play my cherei amour stevie wonder or soul sister brown sugar sam and dave which was one i did manage to buy for all of my friends from that time sylvia dean i should also have said that ben astle also played an excellent couple of sessions at wellingborough ktf xx sylvia dean just back from the wellingborough alldayer an excellent day which ended in sadness with the loss of a soulie.but the day was great for the music.some really good sessions and none more so than kieth minshull keith played nothing different but he played classic wheel torch wigan sounds .but the art.. and the art of a good dj like keith.. is ..to get the combinations right and keith did this so very well.the floor was filled and people danced and danced.. others sat around and listened.. the atmosphere was tangible this to me is what a good soul session is all about.. thanks keith and thanks kev bourne for a really good alldayer.ktf mike derek whalleywherever i lay my hat was written by marvin gaye barrett strong and norman whitefield and first recorded by marvin gaye in 1962 then released in 1963 on the album stubborn kinda fellow.in 1966 it was recorded by the temptations but not released later to be done in 1969 then by paul young in 1983.as far as i 'm aware marv johnson did'nt record it but with our music you never know.hope that helps goldie talkin double dutch pete s back from holland yipeeeeeeeeeeeeeee straight in to wheel mode ..sundays session will be 2 rooms at de home of soul the twisted wheel manchester oh my god2 of de best friday sunday cant wait goldie in double heaven todays tracks laughing boy mary wells hold on i m comin sam dave yipeeeeeeeeee grrhhrrhhxxxxxxxxx andy scoffin crewe summer of 69 what a landmark for me bought my first motown lp the four tops greatest hits they are dancing at a garden party on the cover .i was 10 at the time and it was a few months on before i saved up for another soul album.all my school mates liked rock and i was the only soul fan so struggled to get my records heard at parties etc still have that album as it holds such great memories steve amison a big thank you from the outer circle scooter club the foxley soul club to everyone who attended the charity do last friday at milton bowling club on the night we raised £328.50p for the heroes ex-servicemans charity thanks to everyone who supported the event to all the dj 's who all gave the time for free to don his staff at the bowling club for the use of their facilities we 've got another event planned for december this year at this cracking venue with the details to follow later ktf amo rob cadiz hey mary great to have you back as i stated in my last mail thanks for playing keep on keeping on any request is a good request and i love nf porter 's song of the same name that you played but the track i wanted was a different one by the vibrations sorry for the confusion rob cadiz welcome back mary thanks for playing my request great job nick as usual loved that full-length red mack your wearing on the web site enjoyed the show but im afraid i have to say that super girl graham bonney was quite possibly the worst record ive ever heard on the show im all for a bit of variety and i know that soul takes many forms but i couldnt see past a rating of b league pop song im sure some people will disagree but my soul-o-meter tells me complete duffer nevertheless some of the other music was superb including nevertheless always loved the erma the fascinations track and sharon jones the dapkings are pure class i hope i get to see them live one day interesting to hear russ winstanley i had the pleasure of going to wigan casino wigan pier a few years later when the scene had moved on along with lots of other local venues got to get to one of the wigan anniversary nights the isleys track never fails to make the hair on the back of my neck stand up .all on its own fantastically good classic stuff that will never fade in my opinion is there any chance of playing the originals tear it on down a truly wonderful piece of music to my ears and gives me some many cool memories of friends and times gone by cant wait for some cooler weather here even the wind is hot at the moment its like a hairdryer i can hardly keep the ice-cubes frozen at the moment time for another tinto de verano rob benny sherman burnage mary wheres -me -shirt derek whalley thanks all for trying like twiggy say 's time and other things clowd the mind and i think i have forgotten more than i can remember clearly now.i think i got the year right though.hate this ageing thing.still hoping i clear this one up because after playing the marvin version again it is not the same as i can recall in my mind.dekka vinny to derek whalley without doing any homework marvin gaye and then paul young recorded wherever i lay my hat hope this helps atb tony heinemann nantwich hi mary request for the twisted wheel gang sam cooke got the whole world shaking cheers tony tony foster if anyone wants to add a flyer to my website www.northernsoul45.co.uk please email me email address as on the website twiggy to ian alford there are a couple of cds out there by marv johnson with alot of his stuff on not to sure about if he did where ever i lay my hat but as i say i do remeber another version i know the temptations did where ever i lay my hat it might have been their version i heard all those years ago time can play tricks on your mind to ob i remember you saying you were at the battle of cobridge lights my brother lived just down the road from the lights and i just ca n't remember the lights being there at that time thou it was about the same time i was fighting for my life in hospital with burst appendix it was maybe the medication i was on that as muffled this period of my life i always thought the lights at cobridge came much later than 1969ish i do remember people hurrying around to get a part of mods and rockers fighting in the movie tommy and one of my close mates to this day gets stand in parts on tv shows its those bloody lights how did i miss um i know for a fact i did n't have a scooter yet i still wish i had my pride and joy along with all the other bikes i had they are going for stupid money now i have to admitt this my francis barnet was my favourite and i just could n't understand why mods and rockers wanted to knock seven bells of shit out of each other as a young emerging skinhead who had respect for others like a lot of my skinhead friends did it was the northern soul tunes that my friends all were after ok a bit of ska and raggee but a new beat was emerging the hundred mile an hour beat i was lucky to get 60 outta my scooter but my sooped up nsu was like a bloody rocket looking back in time it was susuki and yammaha bikes like that that ruined our motorbike industry i guess progress is a good thing but it can cause saddness looking back are we moving at far to fast a pace of life is this the reason why some of the youngsters look lost with todays pace to get there well before they have learned to walk too many pressures are put on young kids and lets face it if good enough what chance have they got of being a success when there are no oppertunities for them you only have to look at football our kids are priced out of a chance because of these stupid football managers who think buying success is the way forward i have to say this as a young skinhead money was never my god and all us young skinheads shared alot of things together the music was the thing that always kept us buzzing what i do feel is we live in a society where silverspooned people are getting in all the right placements weither its football or media or what ever you only have to listen to some of the arrogance of some on tele who for me want bringing down a peg or two with all these quango knutters ruining our society my mate as just lost his job and he went for a job pushing a bloody trolley at the hospital the first thing he was asked wheres you nvq because without it you wunna get a job my god whats up with this country you need a ucking degree to push a trolley now sorry about the language ob but its the pits

with you about reach out for me roy 's version will always be my favourite dionne made other stuff nobody else could touch regarding the way a song is sung i do n't know roys heartache hurry on by but if its anything like let the music play i know i will like it barbara lewis i do have a cd by her from years gone by and my sources have let me have this and that by barbara what can i say bret absolute classic singers who would turn anybodys ears you know what bret my mother is 84 bloody years old and shes just got into the last 50 of stoke-on-trents got talent i told my mum why do it mum why do you have to prove you can sing at your age my mums reply do n't take my dream away this is for the old uns i said mum you have n't got the looks and the false things between your chest and mum you anna got any botox in your lips how can ya win it my mum shut me up by saying its not about the winning and yes i know it most probably will be a fix but thats why you conna take my dream away to be honest my mum sings alot like vera lynne which is not my cup of tea but to be honest bret it would be nice if somebody won it because they can sing because of something that comes from the vocal cords and not something that comes from a glossy mag my mums idol was ela fitzgerald and it was my mother all those years ago who put me onto ela fitzgeralds get ready long before any dj from any radio station or from any pub or club playlists can she win it no chance.we have very simular tastes bret brett twiggy – no need to request mary nick to play those tracks i mentioned o.c smith s i m glad i feel in love with you and robert john s since i felt this way because you ve already done it hopefully they ll pick it up and play them from the mesbo if we can only have 1 played then it 's a no contest o.c smith everytime brett twiggy – i m a big fan of roy hamilton and his version of reach out for me is in my opinion even better than dionne warwick s also heartache hurry on by and let the music play are worth a listen as for barbara lewis of the tracks that i have the ones i rate from her include how can i tell you i remember the feeling love makes the world go round don t forget about me sho nuff you made me a woman and last but by no means least someday we re gon na love again goldie like an inferno yipeeeee its nearly mary fox time then love trap de footie club port vale ..

young dancers wunna let us down they say they managed to get some old footage of the girls wheelettes from when they were 16 ish it would be nice to see the girls spinning and doing the motown steps my god the early 70 's were hard but this music lifted a lot of youngsters spirits i think we had about 10 harsh winters one after another while soul music was emerging during our coming of age of realising boy meets girl thing and what a lovely era we had listening to artists that could sing goldie over de moon pete s house sorted de car but now dey are off to lytham by de sea ..nick marshal

great cover is by gerald levert saidly gerald passed away at such a young age and gerald levert did some awesome stuff talking of white singers doing the soul stuff to be honest i did n't or wo n't except that soul music is done by any colour better souls in the person thats why we have a saul and call it soul music the music reaches us all differently do n't know if you have heard robert johns when the party is over it puts shivers down my spine and some of the lyrics were wrote by someone who must have been hurting inside i do n't want you having a good time without me and robert bends

white people singing soul but joan osborn really nails whats become a fantastic version i love the way she hangs on to the note.on the topic in general i think white people can sing the uptempo 'motown type numbers up to a point as these tracks are almost about the instrumantal as much as the vocal after all chris clarke gives frank wilson a run for his money on 'do i love you im not so sure about singing southern soul though i couldnt see tom jones even in his prime replacing otis redding o.v.wright or a james carr.you only have to listen to hear the moody blues murder bessie banks 'go now to prove the point.any chance possibly of hearing o.v wright and 'ill take care of you many thanks mick crowe sussex soulie andrew sc hello folks can i plug a gig that is coming soon to the crewe alex gresty road club on sunday september 27th 2009 we are having an all dayer 12:00 noon till 10:00 pm why well a good friend to many of us on the local scene and known to many twisted wheel goer 's and soul in the sun triper 's dave griffths griff was struck down last year by an awful debilitating illness at one point many of us thought we may lose him but slowly over the last 12 months griff with the 24/7 love and care of his brilliant lady carole and a few incredible doctors and nurses has made a remarkable recovery he is still a long way off but every time any of us see or speak with him he always goes on about how he as missed the wheel or bridlington or s in the s. so we have decided to throw a party for him we are calling the day for one day only the wheel comes to griff i will be putting a few flyers round at the wheel and other gigs we are asking for £5 fiver for a ticket the dj list is looking fairly healthy with some class people coming forward i am taking e mail requests so if you are interested then a.norburn btinternet.com or text me on 07725 674056.griff promises to come along for a couple of hours or more and will bring his camera thanks to mary/nick for allowing this plug ktf you all ps griff does have a favorite charity where all proceeds will go twiggy hi mary top draw joan osbornes version of what becomes of the broken hearted blast out gerald leverts version of reach out for me just to wake the anoraks up i did n't see or get the point of this weeks guest entitled to his guest spot but i just wonder how would he have know the emerging northern soul scene when in america hob knobbing then to top it off comes back to all places stoke and gets a fully aquipped radio station to boot the northern scene was about humble kids who had now't but the tunes who worshipped artistes who nobody else seemed to want to know are n't some just in the right place at the right time all the bloody time i have to say what i feel and i think far to many now are taking the iss outta us true fans of soul music for instance why do we need to go on holiday to listen to soul music when its taken us 30 or so years to get it back on some of our radio stations in this country i know i will be be blasted for being out spoken but far to many who did n't do alot or involved with the scene by that i mean attending soul nites are getting recognition they dunna deserve this scene did n't die in the 70 's alot in the back ground worked hard trying to preach the un-preachable to the mainstream who have been bombarded with very average pop music for decades not blowing mr minshulls trumpet here but along with others he never quit the scene or picked up from when the heyday finished for alot soul fans keep the faith they say hey ya can lead a horse to water but ya conna make him drink it gripe over goldie madly in love football season starts soon.but who cares its de wheel fixtures i -is interested in a hat trick of soul sizzlers at de home of soul sunday 9th august with special guest keith minsul 3-9 a fiver on de door..friday 28th with guest barry tasker 9pm till 2-15am a fiver on de door ..extra extra sunday 30th

shaker nick marshall me a fiver de turnstile cant wait yipeeeeeeeeee ..thou art peter upon this rock i build my church amen .thou art peter roberts upon this old plumbing heating warehouse i build our soul scene yipeeeeeeeee goldie mil xxxxxxxxxx grrrhhhrrrhhh mike linda re goldie yes mate what a night again at the best soul club in the country everyone had such a good time how do pete john keep the standards of that place so high it 's just awsome a lot of truth was spoken in your post as allways the wheel and it 's patrons along with all soulies do so much for charities and good causes they should all be proud in my opinion soul should be a religion purely because of the pleasure it brings and the good it 's people do for others every week some event is raising money for some worthy charity fantastic anyway see you all at the twisted wheel on sunday for another brilliant afternoon john shaft by sammy davis jr can you dig it hello there nick looking forward to your time of sitting in for mary while she is away.by the sounds of some of her tracks played last week .we think she needs a break to regenerate.i feel 'naughty now for saying this.mary will probally 'sort me on her return etc but overall the show was ok no there was a time by james brown again though it 's got to be a better track than barry white etc although i like alot of the early bbbw stuff though any chance you could play the above on next weeks show .its a great version of the sadly departed i h classic.bit dissapointed nobody else has come up with anymore beatles covers by our well known 'soul gods etc.there is some great 'stuff out there you know perhaps they are all away on there hols at the moment another one that comes to mind is a frankie v version of that sw track we can work it out that mary played the other week.think it was on wb circa 1976 i first heard the sd jr track at disco in palma while on hol with the 'rose whilst we were still young and free and could stay awake after 11.00pm in the 1970 's and spent many many years trying to get hold of a copy.because i did not know at the time that the track was s d jr.it 's probally 'disco but we like it anyway.i have even another version of shaft it 's on the island label but i can not remember the name i think they were a group not an artist and i think it was an pure instro of the track.anybody out there get me out of my 'senior moment please i alford thanks for your help .i will check those items out.that label is a good un i think i have some northern tracks on this label .but i will have to check it out.back in the uk i do have some of trojan chartbusters lp 's that were around at the same time as the motown chartbuster lp 's in the 1970 's but it 's not bb.that was much much early when my daughter finally 'produces and if and when i can get back to the uk .i am sure i have a list somewhere in my very young handwriting of some of the bb 45 's i had before i gave them away what a fool i was ktf

chartbusters volumes 1-6 on august 10th not blue beat but some good stuff on there mate ..ktf herman allan from sheffield hi everybody firstly i would like too wish everyone on the board a most sincere apology for the lack of postings on my part to the board with my next series of articles ie.the one 's highlighting cheap but great records for investment purposes or buying for pleasure and profit unfortunately due to a number of increased family committments i just have n't had the time and am not likely to have any time available for this endevoir in the medium to long term.is n't life a bitch and throws everything at you especially when you yourself could do with a rest.i was only joking with the wife just over a month ago if they ever wanted to make a new reallity tv show about a family who attract bad luck they need look no further than us.most people would probably have a run of bad luck followed by a run of good luck not me and mine at timesit makes you feel like rolling over and saying that 's enough i ca n't take anymore but i in my way turn for solace in my soul music and manage to carry on i wish i had problems like keith foskett from oswestry i would be skipping and dancing and jumping for joy no offence keith what has happened to not only those i love in the last month but to those of my extended family that have had what they have had to cope with if related would probably not be believed or fully taken in by any one hearing it i will not detail all the gory details suffice to say i do n't want or need any more months like this for those who are interested i will try to continue with the articles at a later date and if i can not get to any of the planned visits to venues for later in the year again except my humble apologies to russ winstanley thanks mate for your e mail it lifted me out of a deep black hole the world needs more great humans like this guy.i will get back to you shortly when i can find a odd ten minutes to thank you.hoping to catch up again soon .yours as always herman allan from sheffield jinksy to arthur once again thanks for your help.i do have one or two trojan cd's.one is a four cd collection.they are all reggae motown covers.interesting some are good some are not you must be staying somewhere near san javier near the other airport on the coast is that correct there 's not much soul going on there to my knowledge it 's full of tourists while you are there check out the inner and outer mar its amazing and there is alot of good 'sailing there if you are interested in that sort of thing there is a so called 'soul and 'scooter club in an inland city place called orihuela but they are all 'kids .they think they know alot but they do not the best place i know is up in benidorm .but it 's like blackpool on sunny day .so i do n't go there very often.i stay on 'top of my hill like the 'frenchman in south pacific here in murcia and listen to mf etc.my daughter got taken into tameside general today 30/07/09 with high blood pressure but it was a false alarm and she is back at home now with the rose 'waiting for junior.anything can happen in the next 10 days remember the old thunderbirds saying .there are plenty of seats on ej and monarch etc.everybody is staying in the uk this year to enjoy your 'bbq summer it 's been 36 oc today and 23oc at night so do n't forget to bring your sun cream etc best part of the day is 5.00am when it is just right for a stroll etc.hope you have a great time over here.i will see if a can remember a few of those bb 45 's i once had but it 's along

soul show i did my first disco with them in 1972 sadly a year later geoff died and in 1974 nick moved to london i took over the disco i changed the name slightly to 'the 45 roadshow this is devon a name i still use our theme tune was and still is 'the sharpees do the 45'.there is a version of 'do the 45 by ryan shaw that has been around for a while and played on radio 2 but to quote dobie gray a lot of guys try to imitate us but the original is still the greatest .the sharpees do the 45 though the sharpees hailed from st. louis where this song was recorded it was released on chicago 's one-derful label the group consisted of herbert reeves vernon guy and stacy johnson and they were originally backing singers for benny sharp hence their name do the 45 was based on junior walker 's shotgun and features rousing sax from oliver sain on one of your shows please could you play it thanks and keep playing the only music pete suzie everett just a brief note to say thanks to all those that came to our recent 'birthday bash at lowton and made it a night to remember.also very many thanks to those who contributed to the alzhiemers collection due to your generosity we have sent cheques

aldridge brownhills willenhall darlaston area etc and we sampled the soul scene as well fitting it in between the catacoombs in wolves and what is regarded by many as the heart of soul soul on trent torch and top rank to name but a few when the all nighters started at the torch and then top rank when the torch closed monopolised our social life .we went to places like the royal the george hotel known as the femina for a while ther spiders web in station street and there were even some do 's at baron 's court in walsall wood misspent youth eh be great to have a chat will look out for you at

wold love to play or hear some of the more recent stuff so we can get this pop crap outta the mainstream and the way to do it in my opinion is to mix abit of the newer stuff with the older stuff thats heaven to me some soul nites are struggling some say its because theres to much competion my personal veiws competion is great and if nights are failing then they must have the wrong djs spinning the stuff thats how i see it and hey lol i have been collecting this stuff for 45 years old and new.the wheel is good for many reasons one i must say is because the people there are so welcoming unlike some places you attend.to mike and linda i know you were n't on about nick i have said the wheel is one of the best soul nites going its up to the lads to keep it that way and i know what goldie as got when it comes to records and i dunna mean the mexican incident goldie to jinsky pete smith as far as i know is n't on the messageboard type in raresoulman and that may lead you to pete he deals in all types of soul raggee and ska so he could be the man to help you get those tracks you are after.hope that helps goldie mad as a bowl of tadpoles hi kev the lovely gloria teresa xx etccant wait

.could you play green door wynder-k-frog for a guy called little hank on ya show please he might be being booked soon for his determination g/show regards ella-c manc sue from stafford sorry mary i forgot to say any chanc you could play it for steve and i thanks x sue from stafford a big thanks to every on who posted replys to my quest for monkey shine but it wasnt harlem shuffel good tune though mary yes it was major lance and monkey time i really must get a battery for this hearing aid ha ha the last time i heard this song was last year whilst sitting in a bar on an american cruise ship it was being played on a background music tape i couldnt believe it ive been trying to place it ever since thanks thanks thanks x sue from stafford hi ray and lydia i have to say im not a true staffordian i emigrated from the west midlands a small place called walsall wood was where i spent my youth but when i passed my driving test i was off in the big wide world and used to go to the top of the world it felt like i was travelling to the other side of the world back then i think it was tuesdsays and thursdays i used to go it would have been about about 1973 saw the driffters live there also i remember i used to park on where the council offices are now and would allways have a wimpy from the stand on there that would still be open when we all turned out still used to go when it changed names to cindarella rockafellas oh happy days sue x bill jane from meir had a great sunday afternoon at the twisted wheel mike linda ref twiggy hi you seem to have miss understood my message my reference was not to nick as i think nick is a great dj and from what little i know of him a gentleman my comments were with regard to another dj who was a guest on mary 's show and he dj 'd at whitby which we attended and thoroughly enjoyed the main room the point i was trying to make was i know of a lot of people who went to brid and had a cracking time soulies should be allowed to form their own opinion without dj 's pulling other events down trying to influence opinion we just do n't need the politics there is plenty of room on this scene for all types of soul music to be enjoyed by all at different venues oh just for the record twiggy i 'm a massive lover of oldies and my favourite place is the wheel where i love to hear the classic 's and soul from the 60 's i just think it 's wrong to hear dj 's rubishing other events publically regards mike linda jinksy to twiggy does pete smith use this mb thanks everybody for your help.looks like there is a 'gap in the market for the old blue beat stuff i can just remember some of it being played at the orginal 'wheel but not many tracks.anybody else out there remember any bb tracks at the old tw mary one for next week 's show.a orginal 'wheel classic.there was a time by the one and only godfather of soul the late great jb.i saw this guy live in the late 60 's and the 'drop beat was born etc what a mover on stage .there will never be another one like him i have this track on 45 on polydor also on king and think if i am not mistaken it was a b side had to go out with a 'feather cut girl that i did not really like in the end to get my hands on this one still she looked the part on the back of my old sx 200 there was a time when i could actually ride a scooter.got on one of these new jap scooters that are all over spain kids can have them at 14 here and nearly killed myself.i looked and moved like jb when it threw me off keeping on with my search for bb stuff.where 's nick m is he on hols not seen anything from him for ages keep on keeping on and ktfjinksy and those murcians.ps nick when mf is away and you are sitting in.if you remember ages ago you discussed some beatles covers by soul artists etc.any chance of a feature of this on your shows.if so can you start with we can work it out by sw one for ob too from anna with the big boobies but not a fallen madonna looks a bit like madonna on a bad day hang on in there by j. bristol or should that be bristol 's mr knowitall see u talkin crap again twiggy lol mick oliver hi mary how are you .just re-itterating my request from the other week havent heard for ages somebody s been sleeping in my bed think it was by 100 proof aged in soul still havent forgot my super time request though haveyouxxxxxx ray and lydia hi sue from stafford think it 's bob and earl 's harlem shuffle do the monkey shine is in the chorous line by the way sue how long have you lived in stafford ray comes from stafford originally lived in burton manor and went to rising brook secondary school are you from the rugby club white lion staffordshire yeoman top of the world sheppards bushes riverside club era love to know all the best ray and lydia goldie captain dstw/pslc happy birthday to jock belated sue pete everett ..request first i look at the purse contours jocks all time fave a wheel classic yipeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee goldiexxxxxxxxxxxxx ian edwards hi rob cadiz yes mate i believe we have cd for cin and i do know the track concerned and will put it on for you mate ecky to sue from stafford this might be the record yea yea yea do the harlem shuffle ohhhhaa do the monkey shine bob and earl harlem shuffle – i used to have the record on the sue label unless of course you mean monkey time by major lance soulong for now ecky twiggy to mike and linda i have been on the recieving end of many jealous tongue but its all about opinions believe you me the dj who you are talking about knows his stuff old and new it gets a bit sad though someone plays a record because of its rareity and value but not its quality i think nick does this now and again loads of djs do it on the scene its a pecking order thing mine is bigger or better than yours kind of thing what some have to do is realise what they once had they anna got now they once were hip in their younger days but to be honest most of um would send me to sleep with some of their selections alot of soul djs go for the same chessy records and it amases me why do they torture progressive soul lovers with their egos again if they want to play or spin the classics thats alright with me whats not alright with me for example is when some blantantly go out to stop progressive up and coming soul djs and thats happening alot around stoke if they dunna know it or anna got it because of say the click they work within then it conna be any good if you catch my drift those dunna last to long in any local give me a nice jackie wilson tune then say drop in a nice howard hewett number hes disco some would say howard hewett is my reply do you know his stuff howards been about for a long time i wait now to see what big fish takes the bait.mary fish ai n't bit'in by lamont dozier great tune for proper lovers of soul music to jinsky pete smith would be your man to get the stuff your are after keith beardmore hello sue from staffordmonkey shine was an instrumental by bill blacks combo perhaps

to now lets hear 'em looks like i might have finally re-ignighted my brothers love of soul with the last wigan casino reunion blackburn st georges and blackpool weekender all attended and loved got to keep sending him the cds for his very early dark morning drives to market with his cattle one of the few times he gets any time to listen to his boyhood passion northern soul and therefore fuel his new-found interest and give ourselves endless areas for discussion and hanging out time and of course dancing to the finest soul sounds around cheers rob malc falle brittany 15/07/09 jinksy-as far as i know none of the 1950/1960 bluebeat record series has ever been re-issued on cd with the exception of prince busters greatest hits al capone 10 commandments etc which were released on the fab label in 1998 this cd still shows as being available on the internet the good news is most of the other good 1960 's reggae bluebeat ska call it what you will we used to dance to back in the day has been released in a series of trojan label box sets most of which are still available on the internet and are not expensive i recomend the trojan tjetd 010 box set with 3 cd 's released in 2003 this contains the skatalites guns of navarone max romeo jimmy cliff desmond decker various artists all good 1960 's stuff which you will know but have a browse on the internet at all the trojan box sets they do root sets through to the mod and skinhead era 's and they will give you a complete tracklisting for each box set i have even got their x rated box set so if anyone wants all the verses to lloyd charmers bang bang lulu get in touch hope this helps with the search if you have any problems jinksy come back to me ktf fizza bev for all the soul in the sunners hi everyone as most of you may have heard on marys show last friday myself bev reported in from tenerife with the news that the jungle bar was up for sale and the fort was under some sought of construction just to prove my findings go to the www.outercirlesc.co.uk home page/ news board to view some of the photos we took we hope these photos will clear things up for you all .fizza bev herman allan from sheffield to jinksy and the murcians.well i wish i could tell you that the items you require are easy to aquire on cd but unforunately not a lot of the 400+ reputed 45 singles that came from the blue beat record label have found their way onto that format and as such the surviving 45 's that do come available unless i am less informed than others can be had on e bay for upwards from between £600 to £800 each.there are some cd 's which feature prince buster but most of these cover other tracks from later on in his career.does it have to be work from this particular label by the way a full list of the 45rpm titles from this label appear on the website www.georgwa.demon.co.uk/bluebeat.htm if not and you require just ska/reggae or work from a particular artist associated with blue beat then go to one of the file share websites such as the pirate bay although i should n't really suggest this as it is not encouraged and can be deemed slightly illegal key in the particular artist or genre and you may find a match or go to amazon or even goldsoul if you wish to buy legit copies and conduct the same search there incidentally if you use the given listing web-page for the label given above and key in the a particular artist off the list you may find what you are looking for.sorry i could n't be of more help but this is not really my type of musicso any expertise on the subject is very limited as a result yours as always k.t.f.herman allan from sheffield mike linda well pete got ta say there is no need to thank all us punters because the way yourself john jock and nick entertained us was just amazing the place rocked all afternoon it 's us who owe you guys the thanks i 've said it many times but how you take such fantastic tracks and raise them to another level is awsome but that 's the wheel for ya eh got ta correct you on a point though pete probably the best soul club no it 's definitely the best soul club in the uk would like to say to anyone who is yet to try this amazing place youv e just got ta do it but you wo n't be going just once take it from me i would also like to add to the point made by andrew sc we were also at whitby and had a great time but was also dissapointed by a certain dj who guested on the show the other week pulling bridlington and there dj 's down during his set we really do n't want or need this he would do well to take a leaf out of pete roberts book and in pete 's words you decide i.e the punters mary would there be any chance of playing for linda and me lonliness made me realise the temptations please looking forward to the show on friday mike linda twiggy to jinsky pretty sure i saw some blue beat stuff on soul brothers list from a few years ago it is n't really stuff i know to much about nick or herman maybe your best hope on this one chris savory blue beathave a look on musicstack they often have a good selection of cds there you could try trojan records but their shop is being revamped at the moment chris steph andy pete you can 'blow ya own trumpet it was again awesome guest jocks great we was all a knackered from a late one in blackpool at the tower ballroom on sat night but those old legs hardly stopped on sat and again at the wheel on sunday no back-drops anymore ha chris w rob cadiz hey ian edwards will the cin night be issuing another charity cd if so put me down for a copy and is there any chance of the track you requested on this show a long time back and then bought at a 'do not long after i commented on it asking if it could be included on the last cin cd but i was too late the track list had been finalised and you answered my messagei cant remember the name maybe john something it would be great if you could remember the name for me and even better if its on the cd cheers mate nice to see you back on the board

of paint has been ordered to paint the boat and a team of joiners are working around the clock i wish i had taken some photos of the boat in the mornings when i got up it looked like the rolling

from his crew look out for goldies uncut version of shameless the captain log i cant wait for ob 's record to come out soon i know some of you have down loaded it from radio shows and i know some attachments of the record have been sent out and not by me but remember that the dean parrish record is still only a rough demo at the moment and will be fantastic when its finished and i will be breaking my own wheel policy and will be playing the record at the wheel and hopefully we will have dean parrish singing the record live on stage at the wheel soon so please when the record comes out

use for our soul nights is indeed up for sale it has been for the past 6 years it has not closed down willie the owner is on holiday and has shut it for 3 weeks there is very little or no chance of it being sold as tenerife is suffering it 's worst period for many years manhattans and other soul bars in the area have indeed closed down as for the fort they are at the moment refurbishing it and doing some structual work because of the new night club that has opened above the fort the floors need to be strengthened and that is what is happening at the moment as always people love to knock soul in the sun because of it 's success and for some reason love to start stupid rumours if anyone has any doubts or questions they can get information at the website www.soulinthesun.com both about our winter trip to lanzarote in november and our spring trip to tenerife in april 2010.can i also thank everyone who supported our recent charity soul night at nantwich civic hall in aid of cancer

starts here -track 2 i have chosen comes from the legendary barbara acklin love makes a woman /come and see me baby which was released on brunswick 55379 in 1968 the brunswick label originally was a new york-based label but under the wings of producer and legendary a r man carl davis in chicago the company produced a large body of chicago style soul in 1966 when the late great r b singer jackie wilson started recording in chicago with this label wilson s biggest hit with davis was your love keeps lifting me higher and higher other brunswick artists included the chi-lites oh girl the artistics i m gon na miss you her barbara acklin love makes a woman tyrone davis turn back the hands of time and gene chandler the girl don t care brunswick was eventually acquired by carl davis and the offices of the company moved to the famous record row south michigan avenue and is worth £20 of anybody s money both sides have provided hours of dancing pleasure over the years other labels carry both tracks and among these who also released in 1968 include mca 1102 at £10 and the one for the collectors out there again from 1968 on the coral label released in italy for £30.rating 4/5 i hope you out there enjoyed this post.as always k.t.f.herman allan from sheffield herman allan from sheffield hi mary well here are the first two of my choices as investment records for the future please give me feedback on your thoughts about what i have written about the records chosen by myself as if no one posts anything this could possibly be the last post i will post on the subject.the post is approx 660 words long and as a result i will post in two parts with the first record i have chosen followed by the second.part 1 follows shotrly here begins the first of a series of posts that will try to extract the maximum of northern soul for the minimum cash layout hence the posts titles herman s guide to budget northern soul each list will i hope be informative and will only continue as long as you out there give me feedback no feedback no more lists the choice is yours each list will i hope help everyone in the long run make some money for the minimum outlay and highlight items of interest which although are cheap are nevertheless great northern soul tunes so here goes nothing .the first track for your consideration comes from none other than gene chandler originally released in britain in 1965 on stateside :425 nothing can stop me /the big lie a copy of this track on this label for those of you with the money to pay for it will cost you £75 but two other copies can be had of the song both are available at dealers of quality soul records and this quintessential slab of raw gritty bass driven chicago soul add to that the truly magnificent voice of mr. chandler this is one which will i feel will appreciate with time although some of those found on the import constellation label suffer from diminished sound quality so buyers beware constellation records of chicago was formed in or around august 1963 by ewart abner bill bunky sheppard and art sheridan abner had lost his job at vee-jay records and with him from vee-jay went producer bill bunky sheppard plus two vee-jay recording artistes that were personally under contract to abner these were mr. gene chandler and dee clark mr. chandler did well out of his move to constellation cutting huge national hits for the next three years notably just be true and nothing can stop me while dee clark got only local hits notably warm summer breezes and heartbreak another constellation artist was holly maxwell whose records for the label included the awesome £150 beat ballad only when your lonely constellation 162 also from 1965.a copy on rare white demo nothing can stop me the big lie constellation 149 dj can be had for £ 30 whereas a stock copy will cost you a mere £20.the third copy of this track will also cost you £20 and is the copy which is becoming more collectable because of the label and its connection to the legendary dave godin who released it on his soul city label soul city102 in 1969 a must for uk label collectors this on its original outing on stateside was a firm favourite at both the original twisted wheel and sheffield s peter stringfellows mojo club was also a firm favourite on the east coast at cleethorpes.rating 5/5.part 2 follows shortly keith beardmore hello sue from

can you play wade in the water ramsey lewis..or washed ashore the platters for all on board and who have shown us all what good friendship is all about xxx herman allan from sheffield to chris savoury.part 2 starts here -the company would eventually morph through to the present day and become the sony corporation therfore the link with stax probably stems from the link-up post atlantic split after the buy back from gulf and western and the ill-fated link with cbs in the early 70's.other notable things about arc was its canadian arm which produced some excellent northern soul tracks including the eddie spencer -if this is love i d rather be lonely you re so good to me baby arc 1206 can of course the arc saga is further complicated by the existence of another company within the cbs network of companies but as this was a revival of a company originally from 1904/08 called the american record company by columbia records and as this did n't start until 1979 and masterminded by maurice white of the r b group earth wind and fire who re-launched the american recording company arc a columbia records distributed label whose artist roster included deniece williams and the emotions another link with the stax record label i hope this clarified the situation a little more chris yours as always herman allan from sheffield herman allan from sheffield i will post this in two parts part -to chris savoury i said at the time of my last post about arc i said that i did n't know of the company but looking through my notes i found that i did have info on the company arc or american record corporation is often known as arc records and was a new york based record label formed originally by merging a number of label into a larger unit regal records cameo records banner records american pathe records and the parent company of emmerson records the scranton button company the new company started trading from 1776 broadway in manhattan new york city and continued to trade and buy up other struggling labels during the depression years in america thus getting cheap access to labels back catalogues in 1931 they became involved with warner bros through a leasing deal involving brunswick records and vocalion records and all associated companies to arc in 1932 arc started the 3 records for a dollar deal selling an unprecedented 6 million units for its time a phenomenal figure outselling the mighty rca who were prompted to create the legendary bluebird label to try and gain supremacy in the market once more.arc as a company bought out the mighty columbia back catalogue in 1934 including okeh records also to keep their competitive edge in the market place the company introduced 2 tier pricing structures another innovation at the time producing and selling records brunswick at 75c and oriole romeo melotone vocalion banner and perfect at 35c.although many labels were made and bought and ended on the parent companies wim the remains of what was left were eventually sold to cbs for 700,000 dollars in 1938 reviving columbia records as a result as it 's flagship abel followed by okeh records as its subsidiary label as a result brunswick and vocalion reverted to warner bros because of anti-trust issues and their rites assigned as a result to decca records part 2 follows shortly andrew happy birthday ob from the north of scotland great

fishin is goin well ps goldie give us a ring please herman allan from sheffield hi mary i have been thinking in my case something which can be highly dangerous.talk of prices of records recently has prompted me to go back and look through my posts and i 've noted that i intended to post many moons ago a series of articles highlighting cheap northern soul records which could be had if people wished to collect them on a budget of say priced between £10 and £30 pounds which over the next say 20 years will probably double in price this could be a large list as i will list them at approximately 20 a week.i think that you will be suprised by the bargains which can be had out there for a small weekly outlay each one posted will be rated and priced and stated if original copy or not.i will be back later on in the week with the first list of 20 .yours as always k.t.f.herman allan from sheffield sue from stafford it was a real shock to hear the news about michael jackson he was just brilliant and his music will live on for ever i just feel its so sad a man who had so much talent seamed so unhappy and troubled r.i.p michael how about playing one of the early motown tunes mary x twiggy to ob happy birthday from us all this end have a good time to jinsky i have never had any problem with the site but i do remember on a couple of occassions not being let on to it great site for bargains but you do have to be careful because of computor virus 's the website again is finylvinyl.gemm i think there is another site and its got nothing to do with the canadian website i 'm sure that tune you after is on one of the british soul compilations on goldmine.hope that helps i 'll have a look when got more time petesco..mon 29/06.. theres a man i know ,who has graced gods wonderful earth for nigh on 56 years now..a man of steel granite like determination ,the will to move mountains.he loves his family he loves his friends he loves god ,even though some would falter at that ,when presented with this predicament.he thinks more about others than himself ,and worries himself sick some times.he 's a deep thinker ,a lover of the arts ,literature ,poetry ,and his greatest love music.to me he reflects everything that is great about life with the calmness in troubled times to match a saint.he has now had a song published based on one of his beautiful poems ,and is as proud as any man could be..when he first played it to me ,he said not bad is it pete for a raggedy-arsed lad from tunstall .lol.well i 'll tell you this it isnt bad its bloody brilliant son 'scuse the language mary .well my dear raggedy-arsed lad from tunstall you are an inspiration ,not just to me but to all the soul family a shining example in a sometimes bleak and soul-less world..the name of this great man ,i salute and wish a happy birthday to my dear friend john o'brien god bless you my beautiful brother.sco xxxxxxxxxxxxxx herman allan from sheffield hi mary my last post was cut off and some important point lost therefore i have decided to continue the post with a few amendments and an added postscript -as i said you as a presenter put out a programme which has to be researched either by yourself and this research capacity is paid for by the bbc in my opinion not enough but you still get paid as so does nick when he appears as your standin etc.you are held in high esteem amongst the soul fraternity and therefore get paid to do what you love in my case it is just that love of the music any info of mine is just that love for my kind of music and a desire to share my limited knowledge with other who perhaps want small snippets of such a vast reservoir of info on such a complex subject i respect those people who have made a living or still make a living but as ginger taylors records showed when played on the show whether a record costs 25 quid as the billy butler track did or 800 quid for the timi yuro track or four grand plus for the j.d.bryant track on shrine you need money.the nearest i come to the latter is a a track on a cd by goldmine a northern soul of shrine that 's another reason why i dislike the title expert because of the lack of resourse for reference on my part.and chris i bow to your knowledge but again i would n't pay £200 quid for the record i as i 've said i have no info on the label mentioned by yourself perhaps others can help you but many small local independent labels as with the motown empire were used as a testing ground by stax before being placed on the main labels a good example of this was a cover of ask the lonely by .i could make out that i know everything and am a font of all info to do with northern soul but thats not the case as was proved i still learn new things on a daily basis.i despite the contrary indications am only a human being as could be said of michael jackson who although a musician with great talent that bordered on genious but like all humans was not immune to all the frailties that being a human encompasses and in the long run it was not why or how he died that counts but the fact that he left a legacy of music for we other humans to enjoy.lastly i hope everything went well at the foxley on sunday for ob and family and was so sorry for not being there because i could n't arrange cover for me to attend because of other family holidays and commitments.your as always herman allan from sheffield paddy shevlin brighton hi mary thanks as ever for starting the weekends for us all in the best possible way.could i ask that you give a mech for our site at www.soul-survivors.co.uk we 've got a social network site there now so people can put faces to the names we 've also got hundreds of tunes videos blogs etc. and promotors are free to announce their events.in just a few weeks we 've got people on from all over the world the power of t'internet anyhow it would be great to welcome a few of your listeners and you of course just tell them to click on 'the family and way you go.love to all especially ob chris savory to alan herman hi alan i have one rexcord in my collection by linden hill on arch 1302 used to be love/remone written by hill and steve cropper and produced by nick charles and cropper it says distributed by stax records at the bottom keep the info coming have a good week andy scoffin crewe regarding michael jackson 's music legacy of the motown era skywriter was a good but very under rated track and his version of love is here now your gone b side of the annoying rockin robin was also a great track.i would n't object to either being played mary there are of course many many more.r.i.p mj a big part of motown 's history and the music world in general theresa happy birthday for monday ob i missed the show on friday night we were doing a school disco wish i was on that boat trip with you have a fab fab time love and best wishes theresa and adj xxx jinksy to twiggy and ob we are thinking of you out twiggy i have tried to register on that website.but my computer is telling me there is a security problem with this site so beware .have you had any problems ob have a great time on your trip.we the murcians have read your message and what can we say.you have great courage.anna one of the spanish murcians wants to just hold you and give you a big hug she is 5ft nothing but a real lovely lady and helps us

listen live.a little to much 43 'neat last night .so i have the funk bros drum section in my head this pm some great birthday dedications to you on the mf show 26/06/09.moving on .yesterday i received a parcel sent from my daughter back in the uk.she sends me some of the local newspapers and a bottle of bovril etc a welcome 'red cross'package from 'back home .it also contained my fathers day 'pressie a 4x cd called 101 northern soul anthems must be going around the uk at the moment.so that will keep me busy for a few days.it was posted in enough time but the good old spanish correo have been sat on it for over a week and i have to go and rescue my mail from the po at my local 'big town in abanila thanks vix only 6 weeks to go now until the new baby arrives and we will be old 'gramps yet again.i could not help noticing in one of the local stockport papers that.if you remeber at the begining of the year i asked mary to play a record for marine danny winters a stockport lad who was killed in action in afghanistan has had his name added to the local marple war memorial the home town of my wife the 'rose and quite right too.but believe it or not the local stockport council spelt afghanistan in stone wrongly without an h.who are these people only in the uk my daughter went to the local marple carnival on 20/06/09 and noticed that it has now been corrected sorry everybody to go on about these none music subjects.but things like this really annoy me and make me feel like mr angry do you all remember 'him from the steve wright show in the 80 's he and the great late brian clough are some of my all time heroes so ob as you sail off into the sunset on your cruise with your motley crew beware of the 'spanish armada coming the other way mary perhaps you could play something for the 'swabs on hms shameless by the armada orchestra they had a few 45 's out on contempo in the 70 's any will do.think james j on bass has just joined the funk bros drum section now in my head.time for a 'dip in the 'pool and cool down.it 's 38oc here today that 's dammed hot have you still got the 'heatwave out there in the uk ktf jinksy and the murcians struggling on in the

show the wonder of the internet ready made soul at your fingertips trev fr tod tell ginger i remember him and his blue blazer with the lancashire rose on his breast pocket when he was 16 as far as being too old he 's 2 years younger than me i 'm in florida now and listen every friday mick oliver michael jackson just pure raw talent.a man who really emerged through his own natural uniqueness.went see him at wembley in 87 on the bad tour and having seen plenty of shows before and since still ranks as the most phenominal show and performance i have ever seen in my life mick oliver ay up mary ows tricks just going to deviate from super time wots that thank gudness did i hear you say ha ha recently thought about a song i havent heard for ages somebody s been sleeping in my bed i think it was by 100 proof aged in soul herman allan from sheffield hi mary sorry if i upset anyone i truelly am sorry.as i explained i had had a bad day.no excuse i know but what more can i say with regards to rob in cadiz i 'm confused myself rob i explained to you i had n't got the album you enquired about on cd only on lp i told you the album number in previous posts contact such as goldsoul or go onto the site given by twiggy to see if you could still find a copy somewhere in the world most things advertised are either on e bay or affliated companies to the site to see if you could get a copy of the album i have n't got the facility of putting my records onto my computer i have approx 300 albums which are in mp3 format on my computer and another say 300 on cd which i could convert back to mp3 but most of my records both lp and 45 's are separate to those the nine cd stax series mentioned which was in fact one of three sets of nine issued ie.27 albums i have as i said only 9 of these in my collection i do n't have the other 18 volumes and as such is therefore incomplete and as a reference tool is i feel of no use without the others in the series but considering there must be something in the region of 4 to 5 thousand different compilations and individual artists albums out there my small collection only scratches the surface thats mainly the reason why i dislike being called an expert i would descibe myself as mildly knowledge-able and thats on a good day i 'm not ego driven despite what i think you may have read into that post as what was said in the second if you look back in the archive you will find what was said is correct and as regards to ian levine perhaps i was slightly hard but i was putting forward my take on his situation i could bask in the kudos but again that 's not me i 'm a total and utter 100 realist.the point about going on mary 's programme as suggested by chris savoury i think was a valid observation on my part perhaps i did n't explain myself with enough cander or clarity the stax main label including the original satellite releases up to the dissolution of the distribution rites and due to small print clauses in the contract the susequent loss of the back catalog of releases up to and including those made up to 1968 as a result of this in 1968 atlantic got the sole rites to the re-release of these without having to pay for them this included 142 singles and 35 albums.after 1968 and the susequent sale to gulf and western and the buying back of the label and the ill fated tie up with cbs records which did n't actually work out especially when the distribution company failed to promote stax releases both by stax and subsiuary labels rather than its own releases revenues as a result fell to a point that banckruptcy was forced upon the comnpany.another 255 stax 45 's releases and 126 albums followed from that label of which six were untitled and unreleased.volt as the main second stax label had 60 ,45 's and 7 albums released before and 145 ,45 's and 29 albums after the atlantic distribution deal of which 4 wre unreased and untitled.these plus those released by other sister labels create a vast number of items to consider when the makeup of a programme on the stax record company would or could be made i believe that with such a wealth of material 60 or 70 hours of music from this label would indeed again only scratch the surface even after cutting all available material one hour would barely be enough to get a full feel of the nature of the label to do it any justice at all 2 to 3 hours would be the bare minimum i feel and to be representative of all people who listen to the programme all persons views need to be consistered i as a private individual have not got the resourses or the time available to do this and also i believe enough expertese or experience to do such a programme if made justice.this was my point about being an expert and why i mentioned the money aspect also and forgive me mary when i say this as its not a personal side swipe at you or any one else you as the presenter and an employee of the bbc do your own research i assume or use t tim northampton michael jackson superstar.sad loss and i concur with jules allen gold coast aus.we will miss him but the one good thing about music is that it lasts forever.ktf nivk marshall hi jinksy i 've got that 's not

im confused make your mind up will you one minute your sounding like an inspiration to people with heart felt words of encouragement and reasonably friendly informed but genuine comments the next minute you sound like a totally unnecessarily defensive grumpy and bitter old geezer i understand that you 've had it tough .so have a lot of us in different parts of our lives just because a person doesnt talk too much about personal things on a soul message board doesnt mean everything has been hunky dory all their life so your not the only one with some genuine hardships occuring in their lives i only saw positive comments about you and your posts but not over the top in their appreciation of your knowledge and posts or overly sentimental either in their content but given with a sense of comaraderie and mutual interest in our beloved music no more no less maybe there is a bit of ego coming into play judging by some of your recent posts please dont be offended by these comments im merely calling it as i see it exactly the same way you do cant figure you out at all i apologise to all readers about this particular post as it isnt even really about music just thought i needed to be said rob sue from stafford best whishes to all on the h.m.s shamless have a brill time and a have a few bevies for me but dont end up wadeing in the water or phoning rescue me and dont end up being washed ashore have a great time love and best wishes sue and steve from stafford x herman allan from sheffield hi mary this will be a sort of part 2 to my post on the board about the stax label it will include other details of label within the group not mentioned before i 'm sorry but i forgot to also mention another couple of labels associated with the stax label which were run via stax the first is that of partee records which specialised in releasing comedy records for artists such as richard pryor bill cosby and moms mabley but as it was n't a music label that was why i ignored it and not mentioned it with the others previously quoted one other label attached to stax carried the gospel message and gave political black leaders such as the reverend jesse jackson an outlet to preach the doctrine of racial equality to a wider audience this was named and known as respect a few inspiring sould sounds also appeared on this label notably by artsts such as barbara and joe and john kasandra as well as the fiestas.other smaller labels included ardent could you have mistaken this label for the arch chris a label invisaged by john fry of ardent recording studio and al bell of stax to try to capture some of the rock market in 1971 artists on this label included cargo big star and hot dogs but notable soul artists also appeared on the labe including sam dees.gospel truth was the first name for the shortened truth label and was primaraly a gospel label rance allen group was a group from the main stax label to regularly appear on it as well as church related groups such as sons of truth the gospel artistics marion gaines singers the st. james gospel choir the enterprise label carried isaac hayes notably his hot buttered soul album barbara lewis little sonny and david porter.hip artists included the goodees.koko label revolved around the work of one artist luther ingram but other artists who appeared on the label included little dooley and tommy tate and reality .the last label was called we produce and included work by the temprees sain lee and ernie hines.again i hope this helps somebody out there yours as always herman allan from sheffield twiggy hi jinsky it must have been snapped up recently but it definitely was their a few days ago i have done it myself many times on this site seen some absolute bargains in numbers then they get a little air play and the next thing they have gone it happened with the dells monster i 'd rather be with you it was there loads of copies 45 going for a few dollars after it was released on a dells cd there were no copies left cheapies thsat is the site is a fantastic site and it said its canadian there were some copies of odds and ends love makes the world go round going cheap but for me the monster is on the other side yesterday my love absolute stormer sorry you did n't get the recotd but as i say pretty sure its on a compilation but which one i dunna know i 'll have a look through some of my stuff if not nick might know hope it helps you herman allan from sheffield hi mary sorry about the last post file it under .i suppose it was just one of those days.now lets get down to last weeks show.the |third degree version of mercy was highlighted by myself in march to nick marshall when you were away the b side instrumentalis n't bad either i could hear some kim weston like influences when i first heard it on a rival programme and thought it was a long lost version pre dating duffy i later learned not so.i also brought duffy to your attention 3 months before mercy was released although her other releases have n't reached those dizzy heights ian levine for all his faults has had it rough of late losing a long time partner in any circumstances is hard but ian seems to be forgetting that we punters are product driven if his product is not selling then go back to basics in the seventies when he first went into record production he used other labels to release single records on vinyl he produced some great music which continued till his collaboration with ex motown stars in the early 1990 's after that he became a figment of his own imagination living in his and basking in his own ego generated life.he began to think that he knew better than anyone else my suggestion to ian would be go to the wheel on a sunday afternoon session and dance with the people listen to the sounds not play or comment just listen soak up the atmosphere and then go away and write music that people will want to hear over and over again until he finds that spark again he might as well not make the music .turning out bland ineffectual diatribe time after time after time will only send you to the bankruptcy court so think on i suppose you all think what an opinionated so and so a right b*****d but what changes that 's who i am i would have thought that you would have worked that out about me all the time i 've been writing posts on the board if you do n't like it bite me anyway mary that 's the story of my life by major lance if you can squeeze it in to your fantastic show and you and everyone else will if they take the blinkers off see where i 'm coming from.yours as always k.t.f.herman

again twiggyonce again many thnaks for your help.had alook at that site is it from canada can not find the above.has it gone jinksy herman allan from sheffield hi mary do you ever have those days when nothing you do can or say will make it better.this happened today so no glib posturing or witty repartee.straight john bull john ob you are a hero enough said.today i turned 56 got the usual cards and a tamla cd would rather have had a record or two to dad from motown and set about my days tasks.have you ever tried to get on with your daily routine and no matter what you do something keeps holding you back well that 's how it 's been today i do wish people would stop saying i 'm an expert on this subject ie northern soul now my aquaintance russ winstanley theres an expert nick marshall and even mary you 're an expert because you all make a living out of the subject this is what you do no matter how much i know about the subject it do n't make me any richer just a lot poorer.i started to write as you know a book on the subject but that got knocked in the head because of family circumstances and my mum 's stroke last year.my point is this my knowledge on this subject maybe vast but it do n't pay the bills or keep the angry wolf from the door people say to me sell your northern soul collection and make money out of it stuck like that it 's no good to anyone sitting locked in a cupboard upstairs but that 's the point amy my daughter says she 's going to fireback it anyway no matter how much it 's worth because what good is the collection without her dad to share and explain each record and what they mean to him.it 's easy for chris savoury to say go on mary 's show and talk about the music play some records as though being an expert like himself me that is that this would be the easiest thing to do but ten minutes on mary 's show would n't do justice it would take me more like 50 or 60 hours and then i 'd only have just scratched the surface incidentally chris the only arch records i 've heard of is a small label from new zealand although i suppose the brit label marble arch do n't count either labels who i associate with stax are the main label ie.stax volt enterprise fantasy chalice hip safice rhino koko and truth and the purchasing company of concord records who bought and reactivated the stax label in 2004 but if you know more than me then that makes you more of an expert on the subject do n't it.to you also the reason i never mentioned the other girl groups you highlighted was not because they were not known to me i could have mentioned them along with the emotions and also the goodees who recorded condition red/did n't know love was so good on hip8005 re-released on stax113 in the uk and he 's a rebel/goodies hip116 that 's not the point.the point is the man asked if any girl groups recorded on stax the answer to the question is yes i know i went into some depth on the subject but that 's just me enough said.oh and by the way i 'm not looking for an arguement or being picky it 's just one of those days now to rob in cadiz the answer to your question is in the negative only got it on record but the majority of the tracks can be picked up fairly cheap if you look on reputable record dealers lists.or even on e-bay.sorry i could n't be of more help to you.actually the thing which i am trully an expert in is feature films but that 's another story only kidding or am i any feedback on the questions raised in this post or comments from other contributers would be gladly recieved and answered by myself.as always k.t.f the so called expert herman allan from sheffield inner-self positive- vibe you can beat it ob that s a promise s.o.s manc ian alford o.b .your one in a million man ktf message to the soul family i have deliberated long and hard whether to make this posting but out of respect to our soul family who have helped me throughout my illness in many ways financially spiritually and respectfully i decided to post it as many of you know through our e-mailing and texting etc my brain tumour returned and unfortunately the chemotherapy did not work this time and last week i was told by my oncologist that i have 3 months to live this is not the easiest of messages to write but its nothing compared to telling my 83 year old mother and only child daniel i feel so well in myself i 'm getting a guilt complex

on this board and say that we are rooting for you to fight your way back to health and enjoy every moment you can if the pain and worry will allow it .and to say i hope you enjoy your boat trip with your good muckers and gen-u-wine soul freaks mickey rooney any sign of a track list or two or should i give up on that one her man do you have those stax albums dj frank dave godin etc on cd if so i 'd love to swap a couple of cds with you if you wanted to that is your soul knowledge has always impressed me since the a-z series of articles the only mistake you made with the second list you did was the title immediately people me included switched off with a title about going to sleep .thats the last thing i associate with northern soul i know you explained it but the damage was already done mate your knowledge and research capacity are second to none summer is here and i 'll be away in the mountains for a few weeks without being able to listen to the show but back by mid-july ..is there any chance our lorry driver mate malc would have the next three shows after june 19th recorded id be happy to pay for cds and postage in order not to miss out and do some summer catching up upon my return from the sierras of andalucia its so hot here right now that its all i can do to lift the glass to my lips and swallow my wine but i 'll persevere to keep making the trip to the cd player and back to listen to yet more sweet soul sounds that brighten every day of my and all the people on this board 's life peace love and long cool cocktails to you all cheers rob andy scoffin crewe have to say i am very disappointed with the moderation of these boards.although the code of conduct stated on here has n't been broken posts have been removed and in my case not even published.perhaps you need to add another clause to the code of conduct adding thou shall not say anything negative about the content of the show only positive comments allowed goldie captain hms shameless miss u 2 mike linda hope u can visit de boat ..1 week a bit to go sir oby dick de crew meet in hanley early sat 27th ..theh we are off rto days boat track a lot of locks by canal banks goldie yipeeeeeeeeee xxxx jinksy to twiggy and chris nice to see that i am not the only 'bod in the world that has heard showdown by the rag .i think after a few plays it does grow on you.but yep i agree with you twiggy the ab version is the 'tops but it 's nice to try new things every now and then said the actress to the bishop say no more lets leave it up to mf.if she can get hold of a copy.she may think it is worth a spin and ask for comments on the disc etc lets hope the record fairies have got their new glasses on this time twiggy you always seem to come to my assistance in times of need.do you know anywere or anybody that has a copy to sell of holly st james that 's not love think its on soul fox on 45.was it ever on a cd not got it never had it would like it on 45.however cd will do.look forward to your help on this one.ktf jinksy.i think them murcians must have got lost in ikea more heaven rob cadiz hey jinksy i have to confess ive never heard rance allen 's showdown i 'll keep an eye for it for all stax fans everywhere check out the wattstax either 1972 or 1973 collection of videos on you tube amazing stuff .and so many great names all getting down totally into the barkays .in answer to the question about stax girl bands i think the emotions had a stax outing or two if im not mistaken .and the staples are nearly a girl band i surpose computer been down for 3 days .nightmare you come to realise just how much of a big role a computer has in your life keep up the good work mary cheers rob mike linda hi mary would you please play little richard get down with it for us whenever they put this on the decks at the wheel the place erupts the atmosphere is amazing you missed another cracking afternoon at the wheel last sunday again mary you realy are gon na have to try it you know.oh and tell goldie from his post that we missed him herman allan from sheffield to ecky with regards to your question about female groups recording on the stax label.when as a precurser to stax satelite records when based in brunswick tennessee a record was issued on satelite103 – donna rae the sunbeams – whisper your love little fool which was a combination of both male and female singers 1958 followed on the stax label in 1964 by stax 150 – barbara the browns – big party you belong to her which combined barbara and her sisters followed by also in 1964 by stax 158 – barbara the browns – in my heart please be honest with me – 1964 then in 1965on stax 164 – barbara the browns – my lover i don t want trouble other notable combination of male and female artistes included the staple singers and the soul children as groups within stax.of-course the label had labels attached to it the most prominant of which was volt and unlike stax many female groups recorded for the label including the following.volt 105 deanie parker the valadors my imaginary guy until you return 1963.volt 142 the charmels please uncle sam send back my man something sweet about my baby 1967.volt 151 jeanne the darlings how can you mistreat the one you love that man of mine 1967.volt 153 the charmels i 'll gladly take you back loving material 1967.volt 155 the charmels as long as i 've got you baby come and get it 1967.volt 156 jeanne the darlings soul girl what 's gon na happen to me 1968.volt 159 jeanne the darlings what will later on be like hang me down 1968.volt 4004 the charmels lovin feeling sea shell 1968 a great version of this classic tune volt4005 jeanne the darlings it 's unbelievable how you control my soul i like what you 're doing to me 1968.volt 4015 jeanne the darlings it 's time to pay for the fun we 've had standing in the need of your love 1969.i hope this was of some use to you ecky by the way what was the record you did n't like this week lastly with regards to the rance allan version of showdown yes i agree with you it 's a great version i have two versions of it one on lp and one on a 45 the lp was purchased around 1975 and retailed at that time for £1:75 the title is stax northern disco sounds staxb3002 the album notes on the back state that stax southern disco sounds was also available on stax3003 and a lengthy dialog from dj.frank ian dewhurst explaining each track on the album track listing range from at last from the temprees to happy willian bell wade in the water little sonny to friday night johnnie taylor there 's going to be a showdown rance allen and lastly on side 1 free for all mel tim on side 2 the first track is you need a friend like mine annette thomas oh la de da the staple singers bet you i win little milton that 's the story of my life from major lance one to play this week for my birthday chains of love jimmy hughes the right track james and blumberg and finishing off with margie joseph 's medicine bend the compilation was compiled by none other than the late great dave godin and also has black and white photos of johnnie taylor rance allen the temprees and the staple singers on the back.the front cover shows a girl dancer with bobbed hair red teashirt full green skirt and rather fetching platform shoes with white leather straps how they expected her to dance in them god only knows.anyway a great album nevertheless unfortunately the 45 is no longer playable although john manship has got copies priced up at £15 on stax:2025152 or on gospel truth:1204 dj for a £10er archie bells version on atlantic 8226 from 1969 £30 is also available from mr manships.the track that twiggy mentioned by archie bell and the drells one night affair was previously never released until it appeared on the album theres going to be a showdown in 1969 appearing as track 24 penned by gamble and huff original release 1969 on atlantic sd-8226 subsequent releases for this album on cd in 2005 on atlantic/warner strategic marketing 676156 and again on herman allan from sheffield hi john ob you asked me about my take on the low points that occur in life threatening illnesses.what can i say about the whole complex that we as humans have for coping with these up and downs that are caused by these events in our life.i will tell you i am no expert in how to stem the tide of emotion that comes from the realisation that we as humans are not invincible and when you are told that you are at a point where life could end sooner rather than later the devastation and raw emotion and deep despair which ensues can at times become unimaginable especially for those not directly affected by it.when i was in my early 20 's i was told that i may never walk again without the aid of crutches as you can imagine this was a devastating blow to myself but being the person i was i always have believed in the power of positive thinking and instead of looking to the future i started to concentrate on the day to day routine which i still do to this day.i live in days not years and set tasks however small and trivial.they these tasks may seem to other people who look on them as things they take for granted in my case i see them as wonders beyond compare a breath the taste of food the mere act of putting one foot in front of the other i view as a miricle a miricle of the human condition.i am not a bible /basher in fact you could say i 'm more of a humanist in my outlook on life and as such i accept that in life there will be up and downs it 's how you yourself cope with these that make you a human i am no saint but a caring and sensitive human being who by caring for others who are worse off than me find solace in that human condition.i take each knockback in my life and always try to see the silver lining each one that comes along i use as a crossroads along the wheel of life.as i 've said to dwell on one 's condition and start to analyse the why and where-for and let the condition take away youself as a human being then it has won always show your emotion because this will show everyone that you are human you are no less of a man if you cry and be seen to cry talk to people not just your family set yourself tasks no matter how small and take each hour as an hour gained not an hour lost each time you wake in the morning another day of adventure live it that day to the full and above all laugh even when you would rather curl up in a ball and hide from the world think of the things that you love and some times hate to focus on getting through this is how i cope even in my darkest hours i know that this way is n't for everyone but if all else fails there 's always the music and as i always say k.t.f.helps.i hope my little note helps john and is of use to you.as always k.t.f.herman

his djs played the atmosphere was truly amazing what a great northern soul venue the twisted wheel is in my opinion it is up there with the best well done to pete he deserves fantastic success for all his hard work i recommend everyone to go and sample this brilliant venue ecky 16 june mary another great show apart from one record just wanted to say i thank you for playing my request last week whoops i accidentally mentioned another stax record mary anytime you want to play ecky s my name – eddie holland it s ok with me chris savory rob cadiz thanks for clearing things up – bottom line is it s all about the music and thanks for the offer of albert king tracks i feel honoured to be a sag member stax/atlantic gang very appropriate at my age i like the idea of a few shows or maybe just one hour dedicated to a label – maybe mary nick will oblige i remember buying the stax records and seeing s cropper name on lots of them but it was years later when i found out he and other musicians on stax was white one thing crossed my mind the label produced some fantastic musicians and brilliant solo artists and even some good male groups but i can t think of any female groups on stax – unlike motown p spector there must be some – can you enlighten me soulong for now ecky twiggy to jinsky you are on about showdown archie bell and the drells will always be the version for me i have got rance allen groups version somewhere on cd as you said strange version did n't this group do alot of gospel everybodys talkin is one of my favs rance and his group did archie bell and the drells did a cover of one night affair same as jerry butlers version well worth a listen and archie and his group did a great version can i find it its like looking for rocking horse muck conna understand why archies monster do n't let love get you down is n't spun more i do feel we must let other stuff get played because to many seem to dwell on how it was big believer if alot of the stuff that made it on the original scene was released today it would n't do it it was right for those times but its nice to find out that the orignal singers and groups did alot of other stuff which i personally think would do some damage to the polished wooden floors not saying that it dunna work for some places but there are entertainers and entertainers it seems now everybody wants to be a northern soul dj just wonder when the craze as died out again they go back to pop and doing quiz nights ya shoulda got that job i bloody hated slade but we all know who was playing that stuff along with sweet and mud were n't you mary only kidding mary chris savory to murcia rance allen showdown another great stax label subsiduary release a classic track murcia you have taste yes let 's hear it please mary on rag

pete and the crew at the wheel almost goes without saying but sundays session awesome see you on the canal chris steph andy murcia to cadiz hi robhave you got showdown same tune as archie bell by the rance allen group in your stax collection perhaps we should ask mf to give it a spin'.its a very unusual version of the tune.in the 1970 's one of my best friends was the polydor rep for the north west of england we left school on the same day and he was only interested in slade etc.why he got the job and not me i can never understand to this day i ended up serving my 'time as an electrician but was never out of work.so when polydor got hold of stax mojo etc i used to given all the 'rubbish soul demo discs as he called them god bless you gary h what price a merry x mas 45 by slade compared to the stuff i have stored away in my boxes i remember many years ago at a soul 'do'.being demanded to play showdown by aload of drunken female 'groupies'.so i put the rag version on and cleared the floor perhaps its time for the disc to arise from its slumber in the boxes and see the light of day again.its would be interesting to find out what the mf audience thought of this track

goldie de dreamer i had a sleep sunday day something i never do .i had this amazing dream..i dreamt i picked these 2 lads up one who lived on a duck pond the other at the dog partridge in leafy failsworth the bowden of manchester ..we travelled thru picturesque cheshire north staffs parked outsiede of a blue yelllow football stadium called love trap ..it was clean classy with a 100 rooms ..the resident dj looked like a latin romeo ..soulshaker vinnie the 2 guest djs robbo greenie were dynamically good .it must of been a dream cos peter roberts was never off de dance floor vinnie kept hurling cds thru the air ..then a gang came up from kidsgrove screamed there he is which prompted john green to go scuttling under ..yes under the stage floor ..430 local people turned up the girls looked like angels the men all looked like tom cruise..the dancing was out of this world angels of note rosemary sadie the 2 jjs jud jan ..do sexy susan from the wirral beryl the peryl from notty ash ..gillian julie chris chuff flash tim all danced chatted embraced this heavenly atmosphere.. pete roberts danced with everyone except me .. then the dream gets a bit foggy stokes finest sir john obrien enters the arena with a saintly posse in tow i get to present him with a football on behalf of dave evison stoke city fc ..robbo presented him with a twisted wheel cheque in the sum of £57million pound that must of been some charity night ..as the night drew to a close groups of angelic soulies surrounded the wheel mobile chatting hugging laughing till de early ours ..we left bound for de duck pond at 3 am we saw derby in the near distance quickly did a u turn as we made our way up the a34 two officers of the staffs force stopped us diverted us thru these twilight bzone woods 3 hrs later we arrived back at the duck pond i had never seen greeny so happy pete got out at the dog partridge after giving me a glass of vimto a bag of pork scratchings with tears in his eyes yelled what a beautiful night what great people what great music it was foggy again i was in middleton on yet another diversion when i woke up from this gorgeous dream about this scumptious soul night i had in the vale of dreams ..i was aroused from my slumber by pete roberts who phoned to ask and of course after every dream comes a night mare where i was why i had missed the wheel for the first time in years i told him i had slept in ..well pete said you missed the best wheel ever scoring 78billion million trillion out of 10 .it was de best ever never ever ever ever ever ever to be beaten .. you missed it goldie oh no i yelled did anyone ask where i was no goldie not a soul oh woe is me any way lets look to the future in 2 weeks we launch hms shameless maiden voyage 27th june that is nt a

the set from the dude in the us i enjoyed his music colin that 's his name sylvia dean good show last week mary on the note of ex-pats can i give a plug for chae in new zealand he has a cracking radio show which is on uk sunday morning 8-10 but has been known to go over another hour it was excellent this morning and what was fun is there is a live forum so comments are made as records are played chae has an impressive collection and i am sure would entertain your listeners but there are quite a few english listeners anyway go to www.northernsoul.co.nz and follow the usual links a good website to follow c mon chae down to you now to contact mary julie hey mary you deserve a medal some weeks wink wink mention no names i just wanted to tell you my soul story .when i was 4 or five this would have been 1967-1968 my older sister used to play records like 'hey girl do n't bother me tams and 'soul sister brown sugar sam dave so i was born to soul.my sister chris married john and when i was 13 i had my noerthen experiance via vinyl embeddeded into my being.although i went to school with people who went to youth clubs where 'soft northern was being played i went with them but it never compared to my deep morthern roots and although i know that youth clubs played a big part in the scene i seemed to side trackthem and have become a 'northern snob i used to go to palais all dayers in nottingham and on friday nights i went to the brit under age i 'm afraid .i was n't old enough to go to nighters and i always cursed the fact that i sould have been born two or three years later mary there are a lot of female fans like me who are not coming out and telling their story on a personal level.i would like to come on the show one day and speak up for the females on the scene northern soul talks of love most of the time and i 'm sure the blokes would not feel the way they do about the music if they did n't think about a lost or new love when they hear or dance to 'the music keep on keepin on julie pete dyson manchester .12/6/09 hi mary/nick as i have not been intouch with the mess-bo for some time i wondered if you could play a trak for your s truly clovers love potion number no.9 or the castaways liar liar .both would be great mary i m not greedy .cheer s good show pete dyson i think to herman sheffield thanx alan for your words of encouragement i know from the mesbo you 've had your share of illness ihave had many messages wishing me well and ive done well coping and being positive but a question to you is how do you cope with the bad days last week was the first time i let my head drop and felt pessimistic and thats not me im a sod at anylysing things and ive got ta get myself sorted-any ideas 56 days in hospital this year and i dont want to see another hospital in my life ok i know some might say its understandable to have a downer after whats just happened but honestly its very rare i get down.after my tumour came back and took all the feelings out of my left hand side i thought nothing else can happen but how wrong i was ihad a pulminary embolism trust me you dont wan na get one of those then to top things off i got a chest infection that put me back in ward 1 with severe hallucinations.so alan any tips bout hangin in will be appreciated im looking forward to the barge trip and once again it would be fab to see faces from the mesbo names so if you want a beer and some snappin come to see captain goldfish pete r jimlad macdonald micky rooney frank gierak and myself on sunday week we will be moored up as close to the foxley as possile ps who are the fff we come in peace bobby rhyl great show mary colorado visitor was interesting music was mixed i thought the monitors track was poor but to each their own my favourite motown track is get ready by the temptationsmy fathers favourite motown was baby i got it jimmy ruffinbobby kev bourne hi mary hope you are well could you please inform your listeners that crewe soul club now have a new website at www.soulclubcrewe.webs.comthank youkev it 's all in the game well done stoke city hello again mary/ everbody.still looking forward to hearing that de 45 on next weeks show send your record fairy to spec savers .sorry to bring the crazy subject of football onto the mb.but i just had to say well done to stoke city for last seasons fantastic finishing league finishing position.nick etc you should be really proud of them all.they play football with passion and 'guts and reflect their manager 's principles etc.he reminds me of the old fashioned managers of the 1960 's and 1970 's when i used to go to maine rd a fan now for 45 years now and city till i die week in week out and could afford the ticket prices etc keep hold of him as long as possible he is gold.he motivates his team and has kept them in the premiership.we at 'middle eastlands would swap you with our ex red put you to sleep manager guy anyday if cr is worth 80 mill but at least we will be able to watch him in the ll next season and he is a great modern player.how much would the great late george best and the best player i have ever seen in a sky blue shirt .the legend that is colin bell .what would they be worth at today 's values had to laugh when i was away in the usa.made a big effort to watch the ecl final in rome.the 'red s.c. 's thought they had already won that cup before they kicked off win it 2or 3 times in a row my backside however the great barca showed them what we have been watching all last season .what a great team they really are.lets hope 'city use some of that oil money and bring in some strikers who can hit the back of the net for next season.then we should be ok.sorry to go on so much about football as i know that this is a music mb.thanks for your understanding.feel better now i have had my 'rant'mary at the next opportunity please would you play it 's all in the game by eddie holman not the 4tops although i love their version the eh deserves a play because you never here it these days.for all the football/northern soul fans who read and listen to my 'rubbish'and here 's to next season and the coming world cup in sa 2010.ktf jinksy and those murciansps rob from cadiz we have your drink up here too.but we put some sangria in as well gives it an extra kick and puts the murcians to 'sleep at night rob cadiz mary good show yet again nice variety of stuff it made my friday night and listened to it into the early hours after getting home late from the bar eye up ecky interesting comments i thought i don t really care or often know what colour the label was of a given song but i do know quality music when i hear it and all aspects of stax and artists that have appeared on the great label have produced classic music that has stood the test of time in their different genres in my opinion although it was by no means their main area of operations i love all the bluesy stuff and have collected the likes of little milton albert king little sonny and freddie robinson for 30 years but i also love the memphis soul of all the classic stax artists issac staples eddie floyd etc etc alongside the gospel stuff and then of course stax artists moved onto the likes of atlantic hi and all the other classic soul labels that tried to compete with motown i like to hear anything from any of these great soul exponents if it gets my foot tappin im not an expert by any means but i know what i like and don t restrict myself by worrying about the colour of a label…and in the case of stax it s also a totally interesting story to boot with the racial mixes of steve cropper issac david porter donald dunn etc etc all playing integral roles in the development of the label through a set of circumstances that threw them together at stax we should take each great label in turn and pay homage….maybe start an atlantic rush of requests to appreciate their rich contribution to the soul world and then move onto okeh and then philly cameo-parkway invictus brunswick….the list would be long you re safe selecting any solid soul sound from the labels you mentioned its all good stuff loved your selection of soul finger ….always had a soft spot for it….reminds me of a couple of old mates hope that helps with the confusion you mentioned nice to hear that the sharon jones/dapkings records connection is being fruitful in terms of introducing us to some new music i was hoping it would generally i really like the stuff they are doing and the story of their label is also a fascinating one if you delve a bit deeper always enjoy a re-run of billy butler….sometimes the thought of it doesn t appeal cos it was played so much but once it starts it never fails to get you dancing and well lets be honest….you could listen to tony clarke just about all day and still be dancing how about playing wrong man by tony clarke…it s a moody cracker and i love having a groove to it cheers rob beachbrit thanks for yet another great show we listen here in the office in hollywood florida you have a few american fans who hang out in my office and generally make a nuisance of themselves it 's a great lead in to the week end as i only have an hour after your show before knocking off time mark boben hi mary im mark living in marmaris turkey expat from kidsgrove missing the oatcakes ha ha its true great show as always would you please play barbara mills queen of fools thanx from mark p.s coming in loud and clear via the internet alan how a about playing crying all night watson t browne.great tune chris savory hello ecky any stax/atlantic stuff yellow blue or even the later red volt enterprise gospel truth josie jo armstead is a classic on this label even early satellite releases you mentionm albert king i saw him at birmingham town hall absolutely mind blowing crosscut saw is a favourite cut of mine as well as the 10min+ blues power keep 'em coming ecky you are now a member of the stax/atlantic gang p.s re my last message should have read 'able to drive not dive it 's the tablets i blame ray and lydia hi mystery person writing about the monitors yep certainly have heard number one in your heart brought greetings were the monitors tml/stml if you were lucky enough to have stereo in newquay cornwall in 1971 bit slow on the uptake there released in 1969 but life was a lot slower then unless you were dancing lol what a belter of an lp with lots of semi stompers on it number one in your heart for one plus time will pass you by serve yourself a cup of happiness etc etc if you were lucky enough to get hold of since i lost you girl on vip 25039 then on the b side you also had do n't put off till tomorrow what you can do today contrary to what was promoted an a previously unreleased track on cellerfull of motown volume 1 since i lost you girl was released 1966 and by the time the punters here in gb had the opportunity to get hold of a monitors lp it was made up by a mix of tracks recorded over several years similar irresistable tammi terrell as for since i lost you girl being the best tamla motown record ever well beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it 's only thursday all the best ray and lydiax trev reynolds to pete sco thanks for the info on the luckey davis track can you tell me were i can get it vinyl cd tape or mp3 herman allan from sheffield hi mary as usual great show last week and goldie and petes contribution truelly awesome loking back over the last few weeks one of the other highlights was of course nick 's couple of weeks and his spot last week but also the track you played for twiggy by o.c.smith the wichata lineman now usually twigg 's musical choices do n't co-incide with mine but on this occasion they did hi-five twiggy for that.perhaps he would like the following the hesitations to dream the impossible dream or b.j.thomas i do n't have a mind of my own or sugar pie desanto do i make myself clear or perhaps two from baby washington on the sue label firstly that 's how heartaches are made and secondly a cver of the timi yuro classic it 'll never be over for me any of these mary or perhaps all of them over the next couple of weeks would do nudge nudge wink wink especially as my birthday is coming up shortly on the 23rd of the month june that is.lastly to john ob keep your strength up and keep fighting john i know its hard and can seem that there is no let up but always know that we are all with you in your fight and after all you 've got to keep those reprobates goldie and pete roberts in their places on this cruise of yours.yours as always k.t.f.herman allan from sheffield ecky june 10th stax chris savory and rob cadiz i m really pleased you have championed stax to be played on the show although i am a little confused maybe you can help are we talking about the old blue stax label or do you include the later yellow clicking fingers also i m not sure what i can nominate for instance i have sam dave and otis r records on stax and atlantic and other labels so don t you want to hear the atlantic ones i also have a very bluesy blue stax record – albert king – i love lucy nothing to do with the old tv prog which doesn t easily fit in the soul scene i m not criticising i love the southern soul grittiness of the old stax and atlantic labels – really soulful stuff i just wanted to add to the debate i guess i m safe suggesting the bar kays – soul finger for the next show please mary soulong for now ecky good time charlie suggested r b garnett mimms- there goes my baby lovely nick

,about £50 nowadays.. pat great show friday pete robins selections really touched the spot eric ernie snipper so funny pat chaffin-carol chester good-sound s on the soul show mary.gud guest s last week pete roberts manchester oldie liddiepool ace show .mary could you play seesaw don covay cos i m chaffin-carol .regard s p brett a couple of comments about last friday s show.firstly i thought pete 's record choices were easily the best that i 've ever heard from a guest he also went on to clarify the music policy at the wheel which i fully support because as far as i know it s the only place still operating from the original soul scene when i went to the wheel in the sixties it was primarily a mod club that played a mix of soul rnb motown and ska pete is right to stand by his policy because that is what defines the wheel and sets it apart from all the other venues i think the numbers that attend the wheel these days most of whom could not have attended in the sixties speaks volumes for that music policy secondly thanks to nick for his tribute the late koko taylor who has always been a favourite of mine i can understand why he had problems finding a track other than wang dang doodle suitable to play a track of hers that i still play regularly is called fire on what it takes – the chess years lp and would love to hear that played on the show which would be my tribute to her billy barking broadway manchester hi b/rad/stoke maryfox.as a first time listener i would like to say how much i enjoy the music on your show i would like you to ask a guy called pete robert s from manchester to do a slot on your show it may be hard to persuade him mary as the lad is re known for his shyness .could you give the lad a shout on your show mary play on broadway the drifter s for him i know he listen s to your show he is your biggest fan soulfully your s billy barking as-is with gusto manchester trevor retnolds hi can anyone tell me the artist who did the fist track that

murcians i have to agree with you about the cd battle of the bands i do n't know to much about black ivory but as you know the cd covers all or nearly all odds and ends stuff i picked mine up for 3 quid un-opened i have seen other battle of the bands cd 's but covering different tastes and styles i 'm pretty sure that if you get hold of the right specalist lists the there ai n't much that has n't been released onto a cd and whats more satisfying is they are cheap.dionne warwick as a few cheap cds out and there are some belters on um so it worth taking a chance.glad to help rob cadiz to tony hightown how can i find out about more southport soul events .especially around xmas or new year time cheers rob john green charlie waring wheel.next wheel is on sunday 14th june big up for twiggy from murcians twiggy sorry in my last posting to thank you for the info about the battle of the bands cd.managed to pick up a copy in the us for a bargin price on the sequel label.really like this item .so many thanks for your help with this matter etc.notice that the cd is 'round one are there anymore cd 's in this series well back to the 'barcos ktf jinksy and the murcians charlie waring anybody on here tell me if the wheel is on this coming sunday or the 14th the week after also best wishes to ob from myself roy and my angie pat boulton totally agree with rob cadiz the board is dominated by a few comediens.sam dees is a new sound to me but enjoyed it as i am attempting to wean myself of the old school in order to graduate from being an anorak tinto de verano sounds wonderful and i am trying to patent the stokies version as we have sun here too.mary i would love to hear my sweet potato by booker t. perfect for these summer nights my husband has just resurrected our old bang olufsen vintage state of the art circa 1972 and we are spending nughts playing the old vynl one i have enjoyed is ric tic relics lp released by motown in the 70 's with please let me in jj barnes etc etc .great show twiggy to chaz hatcher lets face it chaz you can laugh at some making themselves sound stupid i personally think some people who did n't get anywhere were or did have got something regarding talent its about opinions and what gets me is simon cowell being a judge anybody please tell me what talent as he ever had so how come he thinks hes a good judge i watched it because i was hoping just maybe there might be something up my street and there was with the clarinetist clarinets are a lot harder to play so my mate as told me who also plays the sax it would have made my day to see the guy win it but britain is becoming great at overlooking true talent i would have also loved getting midnight motion to the clarinetist or chaz how about him banging out junior walkers walk in the night or maybe riding high on love i just think the song he chose just did n't have the right thing going for it but pretty sure the guy will be a star and he did n't seem to have an ego like some in entertainment have got chaz one more point it would be nice if the bbc gave simon cowells show some competion but the luvvies who run the bbc just have n't got a bloody clue what us viewers want its up to the bbc to find something different but talent scouts are like football scouts they all have these badges and qualifications but do n't seem to have much else when recognising true potential i have had a word with mary about the bad treatment that was dished out to that young pianoist the judges told her mate to ditch her on national television on simon cowells say so the girl got dumped by her friend because her lust for stardom meant more the poor girl was heartbroken and what gets me is this she actully played the piano pretty well so i have asked mary if poss get the girl a break on her show get her to do hurt so bad or wade in the water by ramsey lewis the poor girl deserves her chance of stardom after those pillacks the judges embarrised the girl hey chaz when you go on shows as an act then nothing should divide them and what those judges did was nothing more than disgraceful and its them that should have been told to go.tele is just about as boring as it gets for me theres plenty of boring actors footballers and entertainers and are n't alot of the films made today bloody crap i play music alot or listen into shows on the radio that play soul music would love to see this film about the soul scene but alls gone quiet on that score we all should be making our own or making something to show the world that there are other ways of being entertained than watching mr cowell and an co rob cadiz great to hear you back in the hotseat mary great show in my opinion i had a little moan about the msgb but its only cos right after the show for 2or 3 days is when i love to contribute a message or two see peoples reactions to the guests songs and news in general and its frustrating to keep logging on ready for some interesting comments and keep drawing a blank for 3 or 4 days anyway nothing could put me off the show in general as it certainly is the best out there for me anyway ive been playing sam dees lonely for you baby a lot recently and have been totally captivated again by the power and emotion in the mans voice so soulful what a great soul sound could you play it please suns shining here and its time for a tinto de verano local drink of red wine and sweetened soda water with plenty of ice and a generous slice and squeese of lemon taken in pint glasses if you live in this town rob goldie captain hms shamelessdstwpslcch.spoqten sorry missed that

good to see our old shipmate ob back to his regular drinking hole aaaa arrrrhhhhh rob cadiz same messages since last thurs .losing interest fast due to lack of care updating your listeners comments probably wont see this message anyway same as the last one that justifiably complained about the time it takes to update the board im sure that mary is extremely busy and i know she has other shows but surely a radio stoke person other than our favourite dj mary can press a few buttons and update the msgb if im wrong and theres another reason more substantial then please let me know and i 'll stand corrected rob sylvia dean mary its levi stubbs day this saturday 6th june.can you play i cant help myself ..one of the all time greats in my humble opinion and just superb vocals from levi chris savory great show friday your guest was articulate well-spoken and talked a lot of sense very interesting choice of records has that set the trend for the future little anthony 's son was working in the uk and he may still be a regular visitor to these shores i have a contact number in my diary my request for a stax record this week can you play who 's making love by rufus thomas if not the newcomers keep an eye on your close friends rob cadiz that was a great stax choice i dug out my soul children albums after and had a listen to them that makes two of us who want to champion stax anyone else out there dare to have a go and join the club jerry butler wrote i stand accused along with his brother billy isaac hayes did a version as well twiggy hi mary thanks again for playing oc smiths killer the witchita linesman that recording of that song is just cravat soul for me.the song takes me back as a young kid watching the trains go past my house why oh why did we let that plonker shut down our railway lines i just ca n't believe that nobody yet as tried to put a tram line or a little locomotive back onto the stretch of railway walks that are still there i dunna know about love train how about a soul train and what a tourist attraction it could be without destroying the trees and shrubs that have been planted along the stretch its a great walk or bike ride going from castle to madeley or castle to chessy which ever fork in the line you pick to take we as young kids ambushed the trains for a few lumps of coal we knew the train had to slow down to change direction so as it came from holditch pit we were ready hey mary what we took coal that is would hardly have warmed our cat up by the fire times were hard but hey give me those times anyday why clogg the roads up when we can make use of these great walks again i guess one problem would be the do-gooders saying the trains are dangerous many have lined their pockets over the closure of our railway lines i for one want um back and think that tourism just might be the way of doing that just imagine tea for two going along at a nice steady pace talking of pace was that break dancer on britain gots talent with us i did n't see him move and then the big flasher tried to dazzle us with her big knockers some say those are talented one of those who say that is simon cowell i just wonder after this final that will be the end of mr cowell the show as run its course if mr cowell is listening in hey get our railways back up and running as we remember them with a little help of his millions he would make a lot of people even more happy break dancer my back side what a joke surely he was booked as a comedian i have seen a dead toad move faster than he did one thing that might have been good for the breaky is that he made a few quid ow't of it what alls he as he got i 'll give him that oneand i 'm after the others number bum bum i would have loved to be a piece of ice in that champanye glass with that other steamy contestant my heart nearly exploded and i thought simon cowell had swollowed his pen did you see his eyes light up and poor peers he was besotted with her so whos going to win well for soul music sake i hope the clarinetist pulls it off i would love him to play midnight motion by kenny g because i 'm pretty sure with that monster instrumental the viewers would n't know what as hit um good time charlie no cranks on here m8 anyway i thought all soulies were mad well they were forty years ago havva gud weekend all goldie captain hms shamelessdstwpslcch.spoqten well wat a week last

is one special girl thank you for the great work you do you are legends here.best wishes to all rob cadiz to chris savory forgot to say benidorm used to have a club called the instanbul that wasnt a soul club but used to play lots of motown and soul of the day ..maybe not rarieties the odd rariety but the isleys the four tops the temps sam dave chairman of the board etc etc i think i first heard sam dees lonely for you baby in there if im not mistaken the club used to have a huge lit-up sign that you could see from 2 blocks away and it showed two silhouetted black soul singers in 60 's suits and a microphone i think the original image might have been a publicity shot for sam dave or some other 60 's soul duo anyway its long gone but my brother put me onto it back in the 70 's and the couple of times i was there with my mates for holidays we made good use of it thinking about sam dees makes me want to listen to it right now .so thats what im going to do any chance of playing sam dees lonely for you baby its about as intense a delivery as you 'll hear of any soul song and is an out n out all-time classic please play it cheers rob rob cadiz hey chris anderton i really enjoyed the tracks you played and commented on your choices but not just to be nice but because they and your taste strikes me as excellent i 'd be well chuffed to get a couple of cds from such a real soul dude such as yourself you did send me a dab of soul cd after your appearance in jan and it is great if you still have my address then id love to give the new cds you mention a listen and id be happy to pay the postage of course if you dont have my address its rob walton calle boya bloque 1 3 ida el puerto de santa maria cadiz 11500 spain usually id offer a couple of cds in return but with a man

nick marshall stanley clarkes the dancer i think was on an lp called school day 's now theres a track if you like listening to someone who can just play a bass guitar never could understand heres a bloke who just leaves the rest for dead when strumming his bass monteaux jazz festival love stanley clarkes stuff ok not northern perhaps not even soul to some but stanley soon will hook you when you hear the dancer i watched montreux jazz festival about 20 years ago and another world famous 12 string guitarist paco he was just awesome i just ca n't understand why good musicians just are n't getting onto some of our radio stations perhaps its down to those who promote themselves and not the music when it comes to presenting a radio show wheres all the originality gone some presenters are just so bloody plastic thank god we have mary who for me is up there with richard searling they can all copy but they just anna got it the dancer got blasted out at the waggon and horses just outside audley and they loved it along with hot butterfly greg diamond darling darling baby everette harp and this time baby by jackie moore along with other killer tunes great beer nick you should go and do

all the years and for me it was that period that will always stick out just like those thoughts of those who originally went the wheel its most probably because we were all hungry for a goodtime teenagers once listen out for darling darling baby which for me is just an awesome instrumental version of the ojays classic to goldie take 10 off the number mentioned and you have got it sounds like all you guys had another good un at the wheel home of the soul club scene foxley freedom fighters fff so captain goldenballs and his ugly crew think they can just sail into our water space and throw anchor eh who gave you permission aqua marina if you lot had asked permission first we may have bent the rules for you but no you had to assume.well assume this you chancers ask permission on this

smith i a remember certain era when you could hear a classic jazz funk track such as this followed by a northern classic and the dance floor would remain full with no disagreement just good music to dance to it didnt last long from memory i saw a request for rappers delight i can remember the first time i ever heard this song at an all-dayer at the nottingham palais i think that was the name and i knew right then that this represented a big change of direction in sections of the scene and boy was i right rap hip hop followed and the rest is history i dont mind all that stuff but you definitely cant beat/match that hair on the back of your neck feeling of a good northern track rob able seaman rooney.. mary just received conformation that my application to join hms shameless has been accepted.the fact that i worked at macfisheries on my c.v. for one year may have swung it pete reckons o.b has enough medication for everyone and said some people need it more than o.b as you all probably know by now pete 's eyes are worrying me many years ago he was on board a cruise liner when it suddenly started to sink after about an hour when all of the passengers were placed in the lifeboats a ship steward opened pete 's cabin door and their was pete putting his dickie bow on singing sir you need to leave the ship were sinking well some idiots running up and down shouting band

this trip we all get a go of the new wheelchair and because he says he has trouble sleeping he can be the night watchman and watch goldie on marys show it came to our attention o.b that your walking a little now so you can do the locks now i 'm along as vice captain and to make sure theres no mutiny on board 'in a way to keep the peace and make sure everyone gets on off the record ob has told me he 's not that keen on pete and goldie gets on his nerves but hey thats between me and ob.pete said he carnt wait to search mary when we pipe her aboard and reckons if he finds anything untowards she may

iffy men talking about an attack on your boat so take your yellow spirit level with you because there is a bent stretch of that canal in a bad area and he heard the pirates planning an attack on you

just brilliant the old movie stuff blew some of us away what are the saddles for goldie ktf old lad if we could bottle your enthusiasm we would all be worth a bob or two worked last week so unable to

loving you carla thomas for ann william grandson of this parish for monday 's show mary can you play deliver me by the beloved from the new classic chillout album dawn cheers to all and never stop dancing twiggy hi jinsky i think you may find odds and ends monster on today label because i know odds and ends did n't do alot of stuff and that label rings a bell yester day my love is another good un by them along with let me try.you will find them on a cd called battle of the bands black ivory v odds and ends i must tell you its not easy to get hold of but if you find one go for it.to micky rooney i do agree with you about some milking the scene but you can get your fingers burnt promoting soul nites or not really making any money i guess there are alot connecting with soul music just to make money but they always get found out and for me theres nothing worse than a dj playing soul music who just dunna understand the music nevermind the media opens doors for some but they will have to go a long way to beat mary who i think if she had all her own way with slections would knock spots off some shows absolute killer mary odds and ends track i bet that tune wunna go for a few dollars for much longer herman allan from sheffield hi jinksy with regards to your question yes the track comes from deon jackson and is found on carla 2526 star date 1966 it actually came out with the same cat no.twice but each had a different b side firstly you said you loved me and secondly hello stranger instrumental i thinkthe artist had 7 titles on the label which had a very chaotic numbering system this does not however stop the track in question being a great tune one which i am proud to say i have in my own collection.anumber of copies have emerged on e bay of late so i would suggest if anyone requires a copy take a look you may be very suprised.yours as always k.t.f.herman allan from sheffield nick marshall hi jinksy odds ends version of lmtwgr is on today deon jackson was on carla

certain tracks like what does it take and it finishes.i always then think of the track that followed on those wonderful discs.anybody out there have the same reaction or is just me that was brainwashed and hypnotised think thats right as a youngster by motown etc if you have any room on next weeks show.please can you play cruisin'by smokey.as we are all looking forward to hitting those americian freeways next week on our journey fron atlanta georgia to jacksonville in northern florida ktf jinksy and the murciansps it 's 43 and 'bitter limon not limon it 's makes all the difference rob cadiz friday night again jeese they come round fast thank goodness … .ive listened to marys last show april 10th a couple of times this week to hear wade flemmons again… .great stuff…an old soul mate of mine told that he thought mr flemmons used to be a drummer with earth wind fire in their early days….can anyone confirm my first ever live gig was earth wind fire at bingley hall stafford….what a show….around that time e w f were right into egyptology and some obscure ancient philosophy and egyptian symbolism the music was mind blowing and the stage show was all pyramids and special effects and the show ended with the whole band climbing into a triangular pyramid-like space ship and it being hauled 30 odd m up into the air and then in a big flash of light disappearing and then all the individual members of the band reappearing still playing their instruments but flying around all over the stage area and 10m above the stage….couldn t see any wires and it was a magical experience for me…somebody told me ew f employed a full-time illusionist to orchastrate their live performances in those days i was probably 14 or so and one of my brothers mates took pity on me as he was picking up my brother as they set off for the gig… .he asked me if i wanted to go i ran into to ask my mum and she said ok as long my brother kept an eye on me… .it was another coat of glue that has kept me stuck to soul music ever since the 70 s…despite various flirtations with other types of black music joe hicks…pure brilliance of taste from derek….newcastle – stoke or newcastle geordieland… im assuming cos of accent and excellent soul knowledge and localized comments that its newcastle staffs still got my copy of earl wright…crackin instrumental dancer im right in tune with dereks choices and a certain era by the sounds of it the ultimate storming motown dancer… tell me its just a rumour is a tune i could listen and dance to all day long… its pure soul genius without a shred of doubt the anderson brothers… orgasmically good and makes me think of so many great venues… i remember sliding across the floor to it at the mecca…probably one of my lifes finest periods and individual moments now i can look back thanks mary for playing mr floods party…..i hope im not asking for too many requests to be played …i could always ease off for a few weeks if that were the case…..but having said that… i was wondering if you could play ike tina turner – you got what you wanted i asked for this a couple of years ago but it wasn t played….it s a mid-tempo shuffler that s great to dance to and that builds into a crescendo of raw soul vocals from ms turner that you just don t hear every day… same era as dust my broom and crazy bout you baby but its never played although it absolutely deserves to be heard and appreciated by your knowledgeable audience cheers rob phil sheridan warrington hi mary i watched the alexander patton a little lovin sometimes video you spoke of a few weeks ago on u tube it is a great he has definatley still got it we are out tonight at tetley walkers in warington its a good night.. kevin from sale to mike from cannock it 's a tough life being a soul loving postie and the sunday sessions are a blessing i 've walked home a few times at 03:00 in the morning and then got up again for the early prep a couple of hours later but my very understanding boss arranged a swap so i could go to the last allnighter in march this month it 's my rota saturday off so i 'll be there again hope to meet you at the wheel sometime so we can have a

the mail would end up though anyway for me this is the best soul event on earth and long may it continue we enjoy lots of venues but no where comes close to the wheel mick oliver hi mary just been reading some of the motown memories.my first buy was marvin s heard it through the grapevine.remember going into bews record shop in burslem seem to remember you had to go upstairs and just being mesmerised by the what seemed like endless list of records to buy pinned up on sheets on the wall behind keith minshull.thats where i also first heard sweet soul jnr walker which youre still going to play arent you along with super time million pleases as for the track that epitomises motown who could ever judge that too numerous to mention ideas would be ask the lonely acapello of course or david ruffin s magical tones with the temps on aint to proud to beg thanks for a fantastic show and ktf.p s anybody pass on how to get hold of ask the lonely disco bazzer people like us who loved soul music travelled to place s like the wheel because british radio was pap all you heard played would be white pop.so when motown released there tune s it was only pirate off shore stations who played them dave abbott pete it could n't fail the 2nd room had to be a winner the old fire station across road is empty you know gobsmackingly good on sunday just as an add-on we told some people about the wheel a few months ago they 've been going ever since i love to watch the reactions when new people first walk down the stairs there facial expressions are 1 where the ********* have you brought me 2 they 're thinking most of these people should be at home lookin after their grandkids 3 after between 20 and 30 mins they are on the floor with a big cheesy grin on their faces 4 when they 're on the way home a look of stunned disbelief on their faces their mum came with them on sunday she 's 70 and she loved it long live the wheel goldiedstw dance stewards log entry starship twisted wheel manchester
