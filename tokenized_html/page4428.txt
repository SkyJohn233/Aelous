read 183 reviews niche user xa0 to clarify my area is silver spring/wheaton/ kensington area other surrounding areas have slightly different dynamics the area s full of culture and there s plenty to do you can find activities restaurants entertainment and religions from all over the globe there is only a little class conflict and contrast within the area people range from somewhat poor to upper middle class but it is fairly high with immediately surrounding communities although there is little violence between classes it is very apparent in services available and the cost housing costs community features all their public centers seem shining and especially education montgomery county is supposed to be one of the best school districts in the us however this because they shower the up county school in richer areas with access money the best staff facilities and funding while largely ignoring down county schools who have facilities in much need of repair with underpaid staff who would readily leave for upcountry schools where students are motivated and tutored lack many of the advantage up county schools have such as multiple training rooms far more electronics and tutors and lower quality food money is granted based on the school s personal fundraising number of students and test scores so the small down county schools are stuck in an eternal rut this is a self-made community full of many opinions and determination we have many recent immigrants and a unique culture read 6 reviews current resident xa0 laurel used to be more community-centered but lately it has become more business-centered it has lost a bit of its original charm however it has kept most of its charms laurel is in a great location about 35 minutes from baltimore and about 45 minutes from dc

small city very close by and two of the best known cities on the east coast within about 40 minutes the area is evolving with some businesses closing and new businesses opening up there is a bit more crime than there was 20 years ago but no more than in other similar areas i have lived in the south and visit other cities often i am always glad to come home i do not anticipate leaving read 58 reviews current resident xa0 my overall experience in baltimore is really good here in baltimore there are always a way for you to get business done while at the same time relax and chill out with your friends i love how open and charismatic the city is you can always find something interesting around the corner there s no way you can be bored here but one thing i would like to see change is the overall safety there are some places in town that even the locals would say to try to avoid plus i always see kids who are skipping school and hanging out i would just like to see a little more force on the law and rules but despite that baltimore is a wonderful place where everything you need is in reach read 567 reviews former resident xa0 perry hall is a nice quiet area right outside baltimore it offers families the benefits of both a small town but can at sometimes feel like a small city not too far away from baltimore or towson there are plenty of things to do that do not require you to travel much whether you like sports shopping eating or just finding a nice quiet park to relax in perry hall offers almost anything you want to do fairly recently there has been a spark in the amount of houses being built it s been a trend for the last 20 years gradually turning into a more urban developed city and straying away from its rural farmland roots while it s definitely not much of a touristy site local families seem to be very happy with the area read 41 reviews current resident xa0 plenty of dc transplants and professional from out-of-state and natives friendly with plenty of children and private and public schools nearby highly rate roland park public is k through 8 with diverse teacher-pupils is ..6 miles away leafy english brick mortar primarily mostly narrow streets with plenty of parking most houses for sale move quickly some have been redesigned inside several bars/restaurants w/in 1 mile or less compare col to where you live read 4 reviews current resident xa0 burtonsville is a nice area to live in there are two shopping centers on either side burtonsville shopping center and briggs chaney shopping center it makes it easy to get food groceries gas whatever it s not really a clothing area though unless you count ross and rainbow the people are pretty nice and the neighborhoods are generally really pretty the people in the area i live in care a lot about their front yards the area has lots of sidewalks and bus stations which makes commuting through the town without a car simple enough the high school has an amazing med program if your kid is interested in that overall it s a pretty good community read 39 reviews current resident xa0 greenbelt has a very small town feel for such a big city especially old greenbelt it has easy access to all you need at the roosevelt center and is very close to d.c. giving a plethora of opportunities and activity options to all its residents the real only downside is that it is in prince george s county and while the local high school is outstanding in terms of its magnet program the school district is quite disorganized the police are typically useless too however and my family has had very bad experiences with them when they were needed read 80 reviews current resident xa0 so far my experience living in berwyn heights md has been good the area seems to be very family friendly and very quiet and close to many residential areas such as greenbelt college park and riverdale berwyn heights itself is not too far from washington dc which is a plus and the college park metro station is also very close to the town which is also a plus read 16 reviews current resident xa0 carney specifically is a quaint family oriented community tucked in the less desirable parkville area imho equally mixed with retirement aged folks as well as young families school system seem to be above average many places to dine and the downtown area is minutes away if that s your bag my neighbors are very friendly and down to earth and for the most part we all help each other when needed we probably will not retire in this area one day as we are attracted to a more rural and less hectic lifestyle but a great place for now read 37 reviews explore the best places for young professionals based on the number of millennial residents job opportunities and access to bars restaurants and affordable housing
