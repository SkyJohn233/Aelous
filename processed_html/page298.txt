Eek! the Cat is a platformer game from CTA developments and is based on the Fox Kids animated TV show of the same name. The player, as the eponymous feline, must run around stages protecting their human owner by removing dangers ahead of time. At any time, Eek can push their owner backwards to give themselves some time to sort out what lies ahead. The game was exclusive to the Super Nintendo. Mechanically, it is similar to the  Rocko's Modern Life  SNES adaptation that was released a few months prior.
