with the risk of the common late-onset form of alzheimer 's disease few rare variants affecting the risk of late-onset alzheimer 's disease have been found we obtained the genome sequences of 2261 icelanders and identified sequence variants that were likely to affect protein function we imputed these variants into the genomes of patients with alzheimer 's disease and control participants and then tested for an association with alzheimer 's disease we performed replication tests using case–control series from the united states norway the netherlands and germany we also tested for a genetic association with cognitive function in a population of unaffected elderly persons a rare missense mutation rs75932628-t in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 trem2 which was predicted to result in an r47h substitution was found to confer a significant risk of alzheimer 's disease in iceland odds ratio 2.92 95 confidence interval ci 2.09 to 4.09 p=3.42×10 −10 the mutation had a frequency of 0.46 in controls 85 years of age or older we observed the association in additional sample sets odds ratio 2.90 95 ci 2.16 to 3.91 p=2.1×10 −12 in combined discovery and replication samples we also found that carriers of rs75932628-t between the ages of 80 and 100 years without alzheimer 's disease had poorer cognitive function than noncarriers p=0.003 our findings strongly implicate variant trem2 in the pathogenesis of alzheimer 's disease given the reported antiinflammatory role of trem2 in the brain the r47h substitution may lead to an increased predisposition to alzheimer 's disease through impaired containment of inflammatory processes funded by the national institute on aging and others alzheimer 's disease the most common form of dementia in the elderly is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a slow but progressive loss of cognitive function extracellular amyloid plaques intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and loss of neurons and synapses resulting in brain atrophy are the main pathological hallmarks of alzheimer 's disease 1 disease onset is usually after the age of 70 years although the prevalence increases exponentially with age after the age of 65 years and exceeds 25 in those over the age of 90 years 2 the vast majority of variants in the sequence of the genome that have been shown to markedly affect the risk of alzheimer 's disease are rare variants in app psen1 and psen2 encoding amyloid precursor protein presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 respectively these variants appear to be fully penetrant and result in alzheimer 's disease with an early onset in most cases before the age of 60 years 3 however these variants do not shed light on the most common late-onset form of the disease although a number of common low-risk variants have been associated with late-onset alzheimer 's disease 4 the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein e apoe originally discovered as a risk factor for alzheimer 's disease in 1993 5,6 remains by far the most important sequence variant affecting the risk of late-onset alzheimer 's disease because of its prevalence and the size of its effect on risk with reported odds ratios ranging from 3 to 4 a meta-analysis is available at www.alzgene.org/meta.asp geneid=83 opens in new tab to search for sequence variants that influence the risk of alzheimer 's disease we performed a genomewide association analysis with variants found by whole-genome sequencing of samples from 2261 icelanders that were likely to affect protein function these variants were imputed in patients with alzheimer 's disease and controls with the use of long-range haplotype phasing and chip-genotype information using this approach we have recently reported variants that greatly influence the risk of the sick sinus syndrome 7 gout 8 gliomas 9 ovarian cancer 10 and alzheimer 's disease 11 approval for these studies was obtained from the national bioethics committee and the icelandic data protection authority written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their guardians before blood samples were drawn and all sample identifiers were encrypted in accordance with the regulations of the icelandic data protection authority in 1062 patients the diagnosis of alzheimer 's disease was established according to the criteria for definite probable or possible alzheimer 's disease of the national institute of neurological and communicative disorders and stroke and the alzheimer 's disease and related disorders association nincds-adrda 12 in another 2697 patients the diagnosis was established according to the criteria for code f00 of the international classification of diseases 10th revision icd-10 we assessed cognitive function using data from the resident assessment instrument rai with which assessment is performed on an individual basis and recorded in a minimum data set mds 2.0 form data were primarily obtained through rai 2.0 for nursing homes which is a comprehensive and standardized instrument originally developed for residential facilities for the elderly 13 with additional information provided by the interrai assessment for home care 14 we assessed cognitive function using the mds cognitive performance scale cps which combines selected mds 2.0 items expressing different measures of cognitive function on a seven-category scale ranging from 0 intact to 6 severe impairment 15 the cps is hierarchical and based on an assessment of several measures of cognitive function a 1-unit change is a reflection of distinct and measurable changes in at least one cognitive domain a total of 1236 study participants with a score of 0 on the cps scale were used as cognitively intact controls we selected 110,050 population controls from among participants in various research projects at decode genetics excluding those in whom alzheimer 's disease had been diagnosed the regional ethical committee and the norwegian data protection agency approved the studies the sample of patients with alzheimer 's disease consisted of home-dwelling outpatients referred to three memory clinics in the southeast health region of norway for suspicious dementia the patients underwent a standardized comprehensive assessment which consisted of taking a medical history from the patient as well as a close family member comprehensive neuropsychological testing a physical and psychiatric examination with the use of standardized assessment scales blood sample analyses and brain imaging 16 diagnoses of alzheimer 's disease were established in accordance with the icd-10 criteria for research controls were recruited as a part of the thematically organized psychosis study enrolling 700 patients and 291 controls 17 and two norwegian studies of attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder enrolling 626 patients and 898 controls all participants underwent a research evaluation in the emory alzheimer 's disease research center in atlanta participants were classified as controls or as having probable alzheimer 's disease after a review of the history physical examination neuropsychological testing and available clinical records in a consensus conference among neurologists neuropsychologists and other health care professionals all controls underwent initial cognitive screening with a mini–mental state examination mmse and clock drawing test cdt and those who were impaired z score −1.79 or less after adjustment for age sex and education and all patients with alzheimer 's disease underwent further neuropsychological testing

participants ≥65 years of age in interviews controls had a negative response to questions about a personal history of a neurologic disease and medical records that included imaging computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging neuropsychiatric assessment and ancillary testing were requested and reviewed when available patients with alzheimer 's disease were recruited at the memory clinic of the department of psychiatry university of munich germany participants in whom dementia associated with alzheimer 's disease was diagnosed fulfilled the criteria for probable alzheimer 's disease according to the nincds-adrda criteria the control group included participants who were randomly selected from the general population of munich controls who had a disease of the central nervous system or a psychotic disorder or who had a first-degree relative with a psychotic disorder were excluded the rotterdam study i is a prospective population-based cohort study enrolling 7983 residents who are 55 years of age or older and live in ommoord a suburb of rotterdam the netherlands 18 baseline examinations took place between 1991 and 1993 follow-up examinations were performed between 1997 and 1999 and between 2002 and 2006 a final follow-up examination was performed between 2009 and 2011 19 participants were screened for prevalent dementia with the use of a three-stage process those free of dementia remained under surveillance for incident dementia a determination that was made with the use of record linkage and assessment at three subsequent examinations we included all patients in whom alzheimer 's disease was diagnosed before december 31 2011 a subset of those in whom alzheimer 's disease was not diagnosed served as controls screening was done with the mmse and geriatric mental schedule gms for organic i.e. medical or physical mental illness for all participants participants who were deemed to be positive on screening a score of 26 on the mmse or 0 on the gms organic level underwent the cambridge mental disorders of the elderly examination camdex schedule participants in whom dementia was suspected underwent more extensive neuropsychological testing when available imaging data were used in addition all participants were continuously monitored for major events including dementia through automated linkage of the study database with digitized medical records from general practitioners the regional institute for outpatient mental health care and the municipality in addition physicians files from nursing homes and general practitioners records for participants who moved out of the ommoord district were reviewed twice a year for suspected dementia events additional information including neuroimaging was obtained from hospital records and research physicians discussed available information with a neurologist experienced in dementia diagnosis and research to verify all diagnoses dementia was diagnosed in accordance with internationally accepted criteria for dementia in the revised third edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders and alzheimer 's disease was diagnosed on the basis of the nincds-adrda criteria for possible probable or definite disease the criteria of the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke–association internationale pour la recherche et l'enseignement en neurosciences ninds-airen were used to diagnose vascular dementia the final diagnosis was determined by a panel consisting of a neurologist a neurophysiologist and a research physician the diagnoses of alzheimer 's disease and vascular dementia were not mutually exclusive we performed whole-genome sequencing on samples obtained from 2261 icelandic participants followed by single-nucleotide-polymorphism snp calling and genotype imputation using methods that were described previously 11 the chip-genotype imputation was based on chip genotypes from 95,085 persons approximately 34 million markers snps and insertion–deletion polymorphisms including the 191,777 functional variants identified through whole-genome sequencing were imputed in the icelandic cases and controls the information content for rs75932628 in the imputed data was 0.999 as compared with 1.0 for perfect information we performed single snp genotyping of rs75932628 using the centaurus nanogen platform 20 no mismatches resulted from a comparison of genotypes determined through imputation and centaurus genotyping of 964 participants including 30 participants who were predicted to be heterozygous for the rare allele and 2 who were predicted to be homozygous for the rare allele samples from the united states germany and norway were also typed with the use of centaurus assays before analysis we excluded samples with a genotype yield of less than 90 and one member of each pair of duplicate samples the genotyping yield was at least 95 in both cases and controls in samples from all study locations and all genotypes were in hardy–weinberg equilibrium samples from the netherlands were genotyped for rs75932628 with taqman allelic discrimination assays-by-design applied biosystems all measurements were performed in accordance with the manufacturer 's protocols primer and probe sequences are available from the manufacturer we downloaded genotype and phenotype data from the genetic alzheimer 's disease associations genada study the national institute on aging late onset alzheimer 's disease and national cell repository for alzheimer 's disease family study nia-load and the electronic medical records and genomics emerge genomewide association study of dementia from the controlled-access portal of the national institutes of health genotype and phenotype database dbgap accession number phs000234.v1.p1 two small components of nia-load phs000168.v1.p1.c2 involving 28 participants and phs000168.v1.p1.c1 involving 570 participants could not be included because consent from participants was for nonprofit use only in addition rs75932628 could not be successfully imputed on the basis of the genada data information content associated with the additive test 0.3 which led to the exclusion of that study from further analyses in the nia-load and emerge studies patients were classified as having definite probable or possible alzheimer 's disease according to nincds–adrda criteria in the emerge study patients in whom dementia was diagnosed according to electronic-medical-record criteria were excluded in both studies controls were free of dementia and participants who were biologic relatives of patients with alzheimer 's disease were not included as controls imputation was performed with the use of impute2 with the march 2012 haplotype release of the 1000 genomes project as a reference before imputation participants with a genotyping yield of less than 98 were removed snps with a yield of less than 98 a minor allele frequency of less than 1 or a deviation from hardy–weinberg equilibrium p 1.0×10 −5 were also removed the information content of the imputed data associated with the additive test was 0.79 and 0.75 for the nia–load and emerge studies respectively for the icelandic data we performed case–control association testing of imputed genotypes using methods that were described previously 11 odds ratios were calculated on the basis of a multiplicative model for the two chromosomes of each individual the method of genomic control was used to correct for relatedness and potential population stratification we used logistic regression to perform association analysis that was based on the nia-load and emerge data sets with the first three principal components included as covariates to adjust for population stratification before the analysis we removed data for participants with genotyped sex inconsistent with reported sex the lower-yield sample in each pair of duplicates genetically related older cases and younger controls to eliminate the inclusion of first- or second-degree relatives and participants with an estimated fraction of less than 0.9 european ancestry in analysis with structure software and using as a reference hapmap samples of utah residents with ancestry from northern and western europe ceu han chinese in beijing and japanese in tokyo chb+jpt and yoruba in ibadan nigeria yri we used fisher 's exact test to perform other association analyses we combined results from the various replication groups and from the discovery group and the replication groups using inverse-variance–weighted meta-analysis the relationship between the age at onset and rs75932628-t was examined with the use of a linear model with the age at onset as the response and rs75932628-t and the apoe ε4 count as predictors we analyzed the effect of age on the cps score using determinations made at several ages for each participant the cps score is based on the resident assessment instrument for nursing homes which is applied on average three times per year in icelandic nursing homes since the residency time in nursing homes in iceland is on average 3 to 4 years many determinations of cps that are performed at different times are available for most persons we assessed the difference in cps score between rs75932628-t carriers and noncarriers in the age range from 80 to 100 years using a mixed model with age and carrier status as fixed effects and the individual as a random effect we used bootstrapping methods to calculate standard errors for the analysis of the cps score versus age through whole-genome sequencing of samples from 2261 icelanders we found 191,777 nonsynonymous snps frameshift variants splicing variants and stop gain–loss variants and imputed these variants in patients with alzheimer 's disease and controls a total of 3550 patients with alzheimer 's disease were included in the analysis our control group included persons who had reached the age of 85 without a diagnosis of alzheimer 's disease with the exclusion of the apoe locus and the a673t variant in app 11 only one marker rs75932628 showed a genomewide association on the basis of either the bonferroni-adjusted threshold of p 2.60×10 −7 for 191,777 tests or the conventional threshold for genomewide association studies 5×10 −8 the t allele of rs75932628 which encodes a substitution of histidine for arginine at position 47 r47h in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 trem2 on chromosome 6p21.1 with an allelic frequency of 0.63 in iceland was found to confer a significant risk of alzheimer 's disease odds ratio 2.92 95 confidence interval ci 2.09 to 4.09 p= 3.42×10 −10 table 1 no other variant in trem2 that is likely to affect protein function showed nominally significant association with alzheimer 's disease table s1 in the supplementary appendix available with the full text of this article at nejm.org risk variants for a late-onset disorder such as alzheimer 's disease are expected to be more common in the general population than in elderly controls without the disease thus the use of elderly controls without a history of alzheimer 's disease would in general be expected to result in an increased statistical power to detect risk variants for this disease we therefore investigated the association of rs75932628-t using samples from cognitively intact elderly controls as determined by their cps scores in an analysis of samples from such controls who were at least 85 years of age the odds ratio for the association with rs75932628-t was 4.66 95 ci 2.38 to 9.14 p=7.39×10 −6 by contrast we observed a smaller odds ratio in a comparison with samples from a general population controls of all ages odds ratio 2.26 95 ci 1.71 to 2.98 p=1.13×10 −8 table 1 the less significant p value that was observed for the comparison with cognitively intact controls was due to the substantially smaller size of this control group 1236 vs. 8888 elderly controls and 110,050 population controls furthermore we found that the frequency of rs75932628-t in controls age 85 years or older without a history of alzheimer 's disease 0.46 was significantly less than in controls under the age of 85 years 0.64 p=0.007 this observation is expected for alleles associated with common late-onset disorders such as alzheimer 's disease and thus provides further support for the association between rs75932628-t and alzheimer 's disease we identified four homozygous carriers of rs75932628-t in iceland of these homozygotes alzheimer 's disease had been diagnosed in two but not in two others ages 51 and 52 in an attempt to replicate the association between rs75932628-t and alzheimer 's disease we genotyped rs75932628 in cohorts from the united states emory germany the netherlands rotterdam study and norway we found that rs75932628-t conferred a risk of alzheimer 's disease in all replication cohorts with a combined odds ratio of 2.83 95 ci 1.45 to 5.40 p=0.002 table 2 combining results from iceland using population controls who were at least 85 years of age and the replication cohorts we found that the overall association between rs75932628-t and alzheimer 's disease was highly significant odds ratio 2.90 95 ci 2.16 to 3.91 p=2.1×10 −12 we also estimated the effect of rs75932628-t on the risk of alzheimer 's disease by imputing the variant in two publicly available data sets nia-load and emerge association results that were based on imputed genotypes for rs75932628-t in these data sets were found to be consistent with the observed effect of rs75932628-t on disease risk in the genotyped cohorts odds ratio 2.66 95 ci 1.46 to 4.84 p=0.001 table s2 in the supplementary appendix we investigated the effect of the ε4 allele of apoe on the association between rs75932628-t and alzheimer 's disease we found a somewhat higher odds ratio in ε4 noncarriers 4.03 than in ε4 carriers 2.38 table s3 in the supplementary appendix the difference in the frequency of rs75932628-t in apoe ε4 carriers as compared with noncarriers had borderline significance odds ratio 0.60 95 ci 0.37 to 0.98 p=0.04 however in a logistic-regression model the interaction between rs75932628-t and apoe ε4 was not significant p=0.18 and the difference in frequency according to apoe ε4 status in cases did not replicate in the additional data sets odds ratio 1.79 95 ci 0.73 to 4.43 p=0.20 table s4 in the supplementary appendix although the population frequency of rs75932628-t was low 0.63 in iceland it conferred a risk of alzheimer 's disease that was similar to the risk the apoe ε4 allele which has a population frequency of 17.3 in iceland as compared with controls 85 years of age or older the odds ratio for alzheimer 's disease was 2.92 for rs75932628-t and 3.08 for the apoe ε4 allele we also found that in iceland each copy of rs75932628-t was associated with an age at onset of alzheimer 's disease that was lower by 3.18 years than in controls without the variant p=0.20 although this effect was similar to that of apoe ε4 3.22 years p=4.1×10 −8 it was not significant owing to the low frequency of the variant which resulted in a reduced effective sample size and an elevated standard error 2.49 for rs75932628-t vs. 0.58 for apoe ε4 we found a similar result in the dutch data 3.65 years per allele p=0.13 and the combined effect was found to be 3.4 years per allele p=0.048 shown are scores on the cognitive performance scale cps for carriers and noncarriers of the rs75932628-t variant associated with alzheimer 's disease according to age scores on the cps range from 0 to 6 with higher scores indicating more severe impairment values are shown in 2-year bins i.e. the data point for 81 years of age contains data for ages 80 and 81 except for the last bin which represents ages of 98 99 and 100 years no cps data were available for carriers in the last age bin each data point represents the average cps score for participants in the respective age bin the i bars represent standard errors the graph is based on 307 measurements from 53 carriers and 24,152 measurements from 3699 noncarriers patients in whom alzheimer 's disease had been diagnosed were not included in the analysis we also investigated how rs75932628-t affects cognitive function in elderly controls in whom alzheimer 's disease had not been diagnosed cognitive function declined steadily with age in elderly persons between the ages of 80 and 100 figure 1 we found that carriers of rs75932628-t showed worse cognition a mean increase of 0.87 units on the cps than did noncarriers p=0.003 clinical determination of alzheimer 's disease is partially based on progressive loss of cognitive function in particular memory with time thus the decline in cognitive function that we observed in rs75932628-t carriers may be due to early cognitive deficits that ultimately result in alzheimer 's disease alternatively the decline may at least partially be due to a loss of cognitive function in old age that is not associated with alzheimer 's disease the latter explanation is in keeping with the hypothesis that alzheimer 's disease may be the extreme of the cognitive decline of the elderly and caused by the same biochemical mechanism 11 inflammation is a well-established histologic feature in the brains of patients with alzheimer 's disease complement factors were identified in amyloid plaques in the 1980s 21,22 followed by reports of clusters of activated microglia complement-activation products and cytokines in and near amyloid plaques 23-26 there is evidence that inflammation is an early event in the brains of patients with alzheimer 's disease 27 it has also been noted that the expression of genes associated with inflammation in the brain is increased in aging and that this effect is accentuated in patients with alzheimer 's disease 28 according to the amyloid hypothesis which is the predominant theory about the pathogenesis of this disease inflammation is a downstream effect of amyloidogenesis which provides a trigger for the inflammatory response genomewide association studies have also provided evidence of the importance of inflammation in alzheimer 's disease thus low-risk variants have been found in cr1 29 which belongs to the complement factor family of genes in ms4a6a and ms4a4e 30 which are members of a cell-surface gene family expressed in lymphoid tissue and in cd33 31 which encodes a myeloid cell-surface receptor trem2 was originally identified as a dap12-associated receptor that was expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells 32 and was later shown to be expressed on osteoclasts and microglia 33 trem2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of an extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail which associates with dap12 for its signaling function 32,34 trem2 has both exogenous ligands on pathogens and endogenous ligands that remain largely unknown although a recent study has shown that hsp60 is an agonist of trem2 in neuroblastoma cells and astrocytes 35 in addition an endogenous ligand on dendritic cells has been found 36 in brain cells trem2 is primarily expressed on microglia the resident histiocytes of the central nervous system 37 activation of microglia may lead to phagocytosis of cell debris and amyloid but microglia can also be activated to promote the production of proinflammatory cytokines or they may differentiate into antigen-presenting cells 38 a recent study showed that trem2 expression is induced concomitantly with the formation of amyloid plaques in app transgenic mice expressing the swedish mutation k670n/m671l in app 39 and this expression was found to correlate positively with amyloid phagocytosis by unactivated microglia the expression of trem2 also correlated positively with the ability of microglia to stimulate the proliferation of cd4+ t cells as well as the secretion of tumor necrosis factor and ccl2 but not interferon-γ into the extracellular milieu this led the authors to speculate that trem2-positive microglia on plaques capture and present self-antigens to lymphocytes infiltrating the central nervous system without promoting proinflammatory responses 39 furthermore knockdown of trem2 or dap12 in microglia resulted in reduced phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons whereas the overexpression of trem2 increased such phagocytosis 40 suggesting that microglia recognize and phagocytose apoptotic neurons through trem2 ligation trem2 has an antiinflammatory function it inhibits macrophage response to ligation of toll-like receptor tlr 41 and it negatively regulates tlr-mediated maturation of dendritic cells type i interferon responses and the induction of antigen-specific t-cell proliferation 36 furthermore trem2 stimulation of dendritic cells induces partial activation without any production of proinflammatory cytokines 34 polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy which produces increased signals from the deep white matter of the brain on t 2 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging is called nasu–hakola disease it is a rare recessively inherited disease that is characterized by painful bone cysts in wrists and ankles psychotic symptoms and progressive presenile dementia with onset in the fourth decade of life usually leading to death in the fifth decade of life 42-44 loss-of-function mutations in dap12 and trem2 were originally found in patients with nasu–hakola disease about a decade ago 45,46 suggesting that the trem2–dap12–mediated pathway may be important for human brain and bone tissue nasu–hakola disease and alzheimer 's disease are distinct from each other and the clinical symptoms of nasu–hakola disease early onset painful bone cysts fractures of bones of the limbs and sclerosing leukoencephalopathy are incompatible with the diagnosis of alzheimer 's disease bearing in mind that it is possible that rare mutations accounting for a small proportion of cases of common diseases may define a clinical subgroup we looked for but did not find clinical features e.g. sex distribution radiographic features and rate of disease progression that clearly separate carriers of the r47h mutation from noncarriers with alzheimer 's disease although the age at disease onset was on average 3.18 years earlier in the carriers than in the noncarriers a homozygous mutation in the 5′ consensus donor splice site in intron 1 of trem2 in a lebanese family leading to early-onset dementia without bone cysts has been reported 47 furthermore three homozygous mutations in trem2 have recently been reported in three turkish probands with frontotemporal dementia-like disease in the absence of bone cysts 48 and there is also a report of memory deficits in heterozygous carriers of a loss-of-function mutation in trem2 in an italian family 49 these findings suggest that trem2 may be crucial for the integrity of cognitive function the r47h substitution encoded by rs75932628-t is located within the extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain of trem2 the amino acid substitution may result in decreased affinity of trem2 for its natural ligands and affect its signaling it has recently been proposed that trem2 may represent a proteolytic substrate for γ-secretase although the exact cleavage site was not identified 50 if this proteolytic activity is confirmed processing of trem2 may be affected by the r47h substitution in conclusion we have found a new risk variant rs75932628-t for alzheimer 's disease although this variant occurs with less frequency than the apoe ε4 allele it confers a risk of alzheimer 's disease with an effect size that is similar to that of apoe ε4 given the involvement of trem2 in the phagocytic role of microglia on amyloid plaques it is possible that reduced trem2 activity caused by the r47h substitution may lead to brain damage through the inability of the brain to clear these toxic products supported by grants from the national institute on aging p50-ag025688 to dr. levey for samples from the alzheimer 's disease

age scores on the cps range from 0 to 6 with higher scores indicating more severe impairment values are shown in 2-year bins i.e. the data point for 81 years of age contains data for ages 80 and 81 except for the last bin which represents ages of 98 99 and 100 years no cps data were available for carriers in the last age bin each data point represents the average cps score for participants in the respective age bin the i bars represent standard errors the graph is based on 307 measurements from 53 carriers and 24,152 measurements from 3699 noncarriers patients in whom alzheimer 's disease
