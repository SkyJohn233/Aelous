cucumbers turning black dying disease or deficiency edible plants aquaponics nation forgot your password by davefarkas september 6 2017 in edible plants my ibc aquaponics system has been up and running since may i have 30 tilapia and have actively growing basil sweet peas watermelon and cucumbers the fish are happy no deaths or disease they eat well the plants are growing well flowering but once fruit develops baby watermelons cucumbers they turn black die and fall off the vine so there 's no fruit yet the vine keeps growing flowering repeating the same thing the leaves are dark green at the growing end but toward the roots the leaves turn yellow then black and die see pics as i said the fruit is also dying is this a deficiency or disease using 3 different test kits i have here 's my latest parameters using api 's freshwater master test kit ph 6.1 using electronic meter nitrates 40 ppm nitrites 0 ppm ammonia 0 pmm using nutrafin test kit phosphate 0 low non-existent calcium 20 ppm low free iron non-cheleated .1 high free iron toxic 1.0 high carbonate hardness kh 20 ppm low general hardness gh 100 ppm moderately hard using rapidtest soil test kit so may not be accurate since i have no soil phosphorus p3 sufficient potassium/potash k2 adequate nitrogen n3 sufficient just yesterday i added some crushed shells in a mesh bag to the water to help buffer the ph and keep it up had dropped to 5.7 some days it should also help with the calcium i also added some maxicrop liquid seaweed which should help bring up the potassium/potash to address the high iron i am working on replacing the tank water over time any ideas what is going on what else i should do to fix it thanks hi dave i 'd bump up the ph slowly to ph 6.4 i do n't know what is causing your issues there but i have a couple of questions have you found out what 's causing your cucumbers to turn black also have you taken some samples and your pics to the local garden store ..in my part of the world i do that when i have issues and they are very helpful and do you have aeration let 's know how you get on cheers thanks for the reply no i still do n't know why the fruit on my plants both cucumbers and watermelons turn black and die it 's still happening but with new shoots i do n't have a dedicated aeration pump the water pouring back into the tank causes quite a disturbance with air bubbles forming deep into the water so have not had any issues with oxygen no fish have ever died so i assume there is plenty of oxygen in the water though i 've never tested it and do n't know how to my ph is currently 5.9 so going down i 've recently added a bag of seashells but it 's still staying low how do you suggest i raise it hi dave i use hydrated lime to raise the ph and hydrochloric acid to lower it to raise my ph i dissolve hydrated lime or builders lime same thing over here but check the packet in a bucket of water and add gradually to to fish tank generally i bump it up 1 or max 2 ph points per day until it gets to my desired ph level i aim for 6.4 ph but bump it up to 6.8 and let it drop to 6.2 or 6.0 at the outside if i need to lower the ph i use gloves and goggles mix some hydro chloric acid in a watering can and gradually add to fish tanks again i try to lower it as slowly as i can and i am very careful not to spill any on me or my clothes it seems to me you have some issues with your media which is keeping the ph down i 'd persist and keep adding lime and hopefully sometime it will even out i do n't think this is causing the problem but i certainly think it will help to get the ph at around 6.4 cheers did you get your problem fixed it sounds very similar to blossom end rot that tomatoes experience if the calcium level is low adding the lime should help both the ph as well as the calcium level just a word of caution be careful not to add powered lime straight to the fish tank as it can kill your fish you can post now and register later.if you have an account sign in now to post with your account pasted as rich text paste as plain text instead only 75 emoji are allowed your link has been automatically embedded display as a link instead your previous content has been restored clear editor you can not paste images directly upload or insert images from url powered by invision community
