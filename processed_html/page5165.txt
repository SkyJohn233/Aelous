[O what would I do without Jesus?] | Hymnary.org During our last fund drive one donor said this: "I love hymns ... If you asked for money,        it means you need it! Please keep the work going. And please, accept my widow's mite. God bless you." She was right. We only ask for money twice a year, and we do so because we need it.
