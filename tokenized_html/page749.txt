insights into the reaction now come from the latest experiments carried out on earth in the first few moments of the universe 's existence — the famous three minutes — no elements heavier than helium were made with the exception of a tiny amount of lithium so how were the other elements including the carbon that is so important to life on earth created on page 136 of this issue fynbo et al 1 present new and exciting measurements of the rate of the nuclear fusion reactions that produce 12 c. the element is mainly synthesized inside stars when they evolve to the red-giant and later stages fig 1 t. credner s. kohle/obs.bonn this three-colour composite image 9 of the constellation auriga includes several red-giant stars a primary site of carbon synthesis the starting point for the relevant reactions is helium 4 he the nucleus of which is known as the α-particle in 1952 edwin salpeter 2 3 suggested that the nuclear fusion process leading to the synthesis of 12 c is a two-step process with two α-particles combining to form a minuscule amount of an unstable form of the element beryllium 8 be although the lifetime of 8 be is only about 10 −16 seconds the close proximity of atomic nuclei inside the dense matter of a star in principle allows the capture of a third α-particle to form 12 c. hence the term triple-α for the presumed process of carbon formation but the probability of this occurring seemed too low to explain the abundance of carbon in the universe fred hoyle 4 and dunbar et al 5 then recognized a crucial point in predicting that the third α-particle could be captured through what is called a resonant reaction this occurs when the energy of the captured particle matches the difference between the energy of the nuclear state and the threshold energy — the minimum energy required to initiate the reaction this prediction meant that the probability of a 8 be nucleus capturing another α-particle was dramatically increased it was based on purely theoretical grounds but was soon verified experimentally 6 and represents one of the triumphs of astrophysics once carbon is formed the other elements — especially those such as oxygen and neon that can be created simply by adding yet more α-particles — are readily made without effective destruction of 12 c. moreover understanding the rate at which the triple-α process proceeds is fundamental to understanding many mechanisms in astrophysics beyond the production of elements it is important for the generation of energy inside stars more massive than the sun and for their appearance in the later stages of stellar evolution 7 it also influences the properties of giant stars and is relevant to the formation of the very first stars in the universe curiously however the rate of the triple-α process has not been accurately determined over the entire range of temperatures at which it is astrophysically important recent calculations of stellar structure and nucleosynthesis use rates produced by the nacre nuclear astrophysics compilation of reaction rates collaboration 8 these data include a mixture of measurements theoretical predictions and extrapolations but are subject to continual reassessment working with data from particle-accelerator facilities fynbo and colleagues 1 analysed the inverse process where 12 c decays into two or three α-particles through the creation of the unstable isotopes 12 n and 12 b they used the decay properties of these nuclei to search for or confirm resonant states in the 12 c system which are expected to have energies in the range of 10 6 electronvolts mev they found a broad resonance at one energy level 11.23 mev but they could not confirm the resonance at 9.1 mev assumed in nacre 's figures the main difference in the rate occurs in the temperature ranges below 5×10 7 k where the reaction proceeds much more quickly and above 10 9 k where it is slower the consequences of this new rate will need to be investigated in detail but the higher rate at low temperatures will affect our understanding of the evolution of the first generation of stars in such stars the lack of heavy elements implies that the cno carbon–nitrogen–oxygen cycle ca n't operate to deliver the energy and to transform hydrogen into helium until some small amount of carbon is created this is only possible through the triple-α reaction and at higher temperatures near 10 8 k that are in a range where the reaction rate has the higher value obtained by the new evaluation the net effect is that with the new rate this phase of evolution of first-generation stars is expected to be shorter at the high-temperature end the lower rate implies changes in estimates of the relative amounts of elements formed during the explosion of massive stars as supernovae and therefore in estimates of the rate at which heavy elements are distributed through the universe fynbo h. o. u. et al nature 433 136–139 2005 salpeter e. e. phys rev 88
