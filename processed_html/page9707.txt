Questions on stopover, markets, dresscode, luggage, women... - Doha Forum - TripAdvisor Hello everybody! On my return  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-25591652', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); flight  to Europe I will have 13 hours in  Doha , arriving at 11am Monday morning and departuring at 01.20 am at night (in May). I will be travelling with my mom, and we would love to visit the city. I am very pleased to find a lot of good question and great answers on Doha. I hope someone can help me out with a few of my questions: 1. Gold souq: What is this? And where/how do I find it? And what about opening hours? In general we are very interested in markets and crafts, any good suggestions? 2. Dress code for women? And women travelling together? Anything we should be aware of in particular? 3. Luggage when travelling with stopovers: I assume our luggage will be checked in in all the way, but does anyone know if it is possible to check in extra luggage when departuring Doha again? (Just in case we happen to go overboard with the shopping ;) 4. Transfer visa: I am aware of the visa rules, and understand that I have to apply for the transfer visa on beforehand!? But is there anyone on the forum that have actual experience with the application proces so far? (We both have European citizenship/passports). Thank you for as many replies as possible! :) Hi, im not sure i can answer all your questions, but one question. are you flying with  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-25707002', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Qatar airlines ? if yes you should try to check their website. as if im not mistaken, they stated that you can request for a free hotel room if you have layover in  Doha  between 6-24 hours. and you can also check their cust service to ask about visit visa to Doha. so at least ur not stuck inside that airport. i;ve been there. the airport is huge, clean, but only one medium size dutyfree shop and poor taste resto. you might want to go out and just take a quick look at Doha. it going to be pretty hot and dry outside. and yep you need to check further on female dresscode. i hope it helps. cheers... Hey Mimini! Thanks for the reply! I don '  t think  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-25708823', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Qatar  operates with the free hotel accommodation anymore, but I will ask them when I call about the visa. Thanks again! :) The gold souk is virtually opposite souk WAQIF. If you ask a taxi to take you to the souk and then ask for directions to the gold souk which is within walking distance. Clothes to wear. Its getting hotter so something cool like cotton. However, you should be aware that vest tops are a no no in  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-25814217', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Qatar . You will be ok if you have a short sleeve and 3/4 length trousers are also ok or a skirt below the knee. Otherwise you might offend the locals and get strange looks. Visa rules. I know you can get a tourist visa as a uk passport holder but you are best asking Qatar  airlines  advice on this. Thank you very much for your detailed answer! Great help! :) Hi, Re dress code for women - the basic rule is to cover armpits and knees, so wear sleeved tops (preferably a bit longer than t-shirt sleeves but that would be enough), and as the previous poster noted, a skirt past the knee or three-quarter length / long trousers.  And not too much cleavage.  You will see some tourists who break these rules but if you want to shop in the souk, it ' s better to err on the side of caution. (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-25924819', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Doha  is pretty easy-going really and it ' s very safe so no worries about pickpockets or being hassled as two women travelling without a man. Day or evening. I haven ' t been to the gold souq - but this post reminded me that I must try that! The souq waqif is interesting but as souqs go, it ' s, unfortunately, pretty fake since they tidied it up and sanitised the life out of it. There are some nice things on sale - and do haggle!  If you don ' t want to buy too much local currency, US dollars are accepted widely but not euros. A last note - if you ' re going from the souq back to the airport (and the souq waqif is lovely in the evening) there is a taxi rank at the end of the main  " street "  - everyone knows where it is. Do not expect to find one on the street - you won ' t! Otherwise, the best places to find a cab are the big hotels or shopping malls. Or take the number of the taxi driver from the airport into town and call him for a return pickup.
