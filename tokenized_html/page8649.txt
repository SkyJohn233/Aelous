online the front page of the internet and subscribe to one of thousands of communities multiplayer lag/lost connection self.aoe2 submitted 3 years ago by migtuga today i tried playing online with a friend of mine since we had just gotten the african kingdoms expansion but when we started the match it only lasted a couple of seconds before it crashed lost connection and while it didnt crash it lagged a lot we were both on the same team against 2 ai opponents and the unit limit was set to 500 since some sources online said it could be due to the ai we tried a 1v1 match but it still didn t work we both have good internet connections and when i pinged him i got a response in 14ms is there any way to fix this post a comment – seasquirrel 2 points 3 points 4 points 3 years ago 0 children lag issues are still trying to get fixed maybe try again – icagel 3 points 4 points 5 points 3 years ago 3 children i don t know the exact why but these things surely don t help high unit limit 4.4 makes game far more unstable they re everyday working on it though some of these are related to aoak so it could have something to do any specific thing you did when it crashed that s all i can think of you might want to play again saving the replay see if watching the replay crashes your game as well some people have that issue important to notice imo and send that to the devs you might have that problem fixed by next week with the constant fixes they re relasing.try playing separately with other players in both original and expansion modes and see if this happens always everytime for both of you might help detect what s/who s causing the issue edit also keep in mind that even though this game is p2p it stills goes through steam before that unnecessary imo but well that s how it is so if steam was collapsed at that point might have caused issues it is pretty much collapsed these days remember fo4 came out – migtuga s 1 point 2 points 3 points 3 years ago 2 children i would like to point out the game itself didn t crash i meant the connection crashed saying i had lost connection to my friend it happened everytime we tried playing together both against the ai and against eachother i ll try playing without the expansion/with a smaller unit limit tomorrow and see if it helps anyway thank you very much for your answer – icagel 1 point 2 points 3 points 3 years ago 1 child oh sorry misread that part long long day don t blame me palso keep in mind that both of you should play with other players to see if you lose connection that way maybe it s that either of you have like blocked ports or dunno something like that – migtuga s 1 point 2 points 3 points 3 years ago 0 children well we tried it again today with a normal sized map 500 max pop against 2 ai still with african kingdoms factions and it worked it lagged a little in the beggining but later was a lot smoother i guess it was either the map size or steam s fault anyway thanks for the help – ragecomicer113 1 point 2 points 3 points 3 years ago 6 children aoe2hd or on voobly – migtuga s 1 point 2 points 3 points 3 years ago 4 children age of empires 2 hd what s voobly – leakyboat2 2 points 3 points 4 points 3 years ago 3 children voobly is another hosting site it only has aoc none of the other expansions as far as the lag goes 500 pop will always lag but it should not cause you a problem in the early game i would suggest trying again it is possible that steam was just slow the day you tried to play i do not have much problem with lag in hd as long as pings are good and it is 3v3 or less with 200 pop also if you are playing giant or ludakris map it will lag – migtuga s 0 points 1 point 2 points 3 years ago 2 children i ll give it a try then thank you for your input do you know if they ll ever fix this issue – norther_ 2 points 3 points 4 points 3 years ago 1 child it s been a problem since original release more than 2 years ago pretty safe to say it s never gon na get fixed – migtuga s 0 points 1 point 2 points 3 years ago 0 children well thats a shame they could at least add lan though – deleted 0 points 1 point 2 points 3 years ago 0 children also african
