SalmanAlotaibi        Mechanical Engineering has been my passion since I was 6 years old. The motion of objects and their interworking inspired me to discover what’s behind those objects. Toys that children were supposed to play with turned into experiments in my hands, there were found all broken in my curious attempt to investigate how they function and what they’re made out of.                This curiosity drove me to join Kuwait Science Club. I was 9 years old when I joined the club in 2005 and became a member of the Mechanical workshop. Back in school I was always trying to convince my classmates to come and join me in what I felt was a science utopia for young kids. Early on at the club I got my hands dirty diagnosing a small 4V engine and I witnessed an experimental rocket launch, something rare to see in Kuwait. I immediately became interested in knowing more about kinematics equations and Newton’s laws.               During my time at the club I spent it reading science books and inventor stories. I admired Thomas Edison and was eager to follow on an inventor’s foot step. I began thinking about solving a real world problem in Kuwait. I looked around and noticed car accidents to be a major one and by the time I graduated high school I had my first patent (US8610595 B1) with a solution that provides a car driver safer assurance when making a U-turn.              I believe that at the heart of society lie human ingenuity and technical innovation giving this heart the continuous pulse it needs, and without a pumping heart society will seize to function. Mechanical Engineering takes center stage in this human quest in driving technological updates. I’m extremely grateful to all the engineers that came before us, that helped us live a better, safer and more comforting life. To the engineers that helped develop my father’s car, our family home’s A/C, my own kids toys or my school bus. I have as my goal now to pursue mechanical engineering at Temple university , I’m certain that there is a lot to learn and understand and believe that Temple university values hands on engineering that will better prepare me with the broad skills I need in the fast pace life we are living.
