CV | chewychiyu Pleasnaton, CA94588, USA ​ E-mail:  ecchen83@gmail.com Phone:  +1-203-435-7000 ​ I was born in Evanston, Illinois, where I got my name from, and grew up in New Haven, Connecticut until I was 14. In the Fall of 2014, my family decided to move to a warmer state, relocated to California and began a new adventure.  I developed a strong interest in designing and writing software codes for computer games and mobile apps after taking a few programming language courses in sophomore year. I create computer games as a hobby and also as a way to make friends, sharing my thoughts and creativity. I hope one day that I can use these skills to solve real world problems.
