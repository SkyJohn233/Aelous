DRF Breeding Staff Jul 24, 2014 Florida-based stallion City Place has been sold to Yarradale Stud in Gidgegannup, Australia, and will stand there permanently beginning with the upcoming Southern Hemisphere season. The 14-year-old son of Storm Cat previously stood at Hartley/De Renzo Thoroughbreds in Ocala, Fla., for an advertised fee of $5,000. He will debut in Australia for a fee of about $8,293 ($8,800 in Australian funds). City Place is the sire of seven crops of racing age, led by Grade 3 winners La Tia and Wall Street Wonder, as well as Jamaican champion City Flight. His progeny also includes graded-placed runners Central City, Hodge, and Gato Go Win. City Place is unraced but was in the barn of trainer Kiaran McLaughlin before an injury prematurely derailed his career. Bred in Kentucky by Joseph Allen, City Place is the first foal out of the Grade 1-winning Glitterman mare Glitter Woman, whose two winners from three foals to race include Political Force, winner of the Grade 1 Suburban Handicap in 2007. City Place is from the extended family of Breeders’ Cup Distaff winner Unbridled Elaine, Grade 2 winners Etched and Lead Story, and Grade 3 winner Out of Bounds. The announcement of City Place’s addition to the Yarradale stallion lineup comes shortly after the farm added U.S. stallion War Chant to its permanent roster. “With the great new Westspeed Stallions bonus, we want to continue to try and source additional stallions for [Western Australia],” said Ron Sayers, owner of Yarradale Stud. “City Place throws jump-and-run types and we felt his stock will be well suited to our style of racing.” Dec 15, 2019, 11:03 PM Remington Park handled $3.3 million on its 13-race Springboard Mile card Sunday, a new all-time record for live handle for the Oklahom...
