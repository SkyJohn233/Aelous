Operating system : Debian jessie Web server: Apache 2.4 Database: mysql PHP version: 5.6.29 Nextcloud version:  (see Nextcloud admin page) 11.0.3 Where did you install Nextcloud from: List of activated apps: Enabled: I am facing exactly the same problem on 11.0.3. I can create a .txt file and put some content inside but once I close it, I cannot open it again for editing (although I can download it). Renaming the file with a different extension like .xml enables editing again. It might be worth noting that there is not any problem with libreoffice (repeated editing of the same .odt file works just fine). Has it been fixed in 11.0.4? At  @resoli  and  @phasenohr : Does the problem still persist? Can it be, that the webserver or fastcgi runs under another user than the file permissions on disk? No problem under NC 13.0.1
