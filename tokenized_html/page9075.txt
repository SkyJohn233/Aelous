oily 1 by mahala 3 years ago the key to this foundation is getting shade matched it tends to run yellow so if you do n't shade match it can be a disaster it took me trying 3 different shades before this worked for my skin the mismatch colors enlarged my pores looked streaky etc but feel in love with this when i was color matched at sephora bare beige color is maybe the most perfect skin match of anyone foundation i have ever tried it blends in perfect and blurs my pores luminous but not shiny as it says looks natural and is a light to medium coverage foundation this is not a full coverage foundation if that is what you are seeking covers redness some acne marks and evens out skin tone but those freckles will still show through since it is a serum foundation it is very thin water like even though it does n't contain water so its very important to shake it not like your favorite drink but from side to side if you shake it hard it will come pouring out of the top make sure to shake it from side to side and shake well then apply like you do the be powder buff it in starting with 2 drops if you want more coverage keeping adding dots 6 is considered full coverage this has become my hg foundation by kassy 4 years ago i do n't see how anyone could n't like this foundation it took me so long to find the right one for my skin and this is it i can understand people saying it does n't apply correctly but to be perfectly honest they have to be applying it wrong no hate just my opinion i used sephora 's 56 brush and buffed it out after applying primer then i set it with nyx hd powder it was flawless and i received so many compliments everyone was asking me how i had such clear skin haha i thought this foundation was too good to be true and that it would wear off in a couple of hours to my utter amazement it lasted all 18 hours i had it on all 18 i was blown away by its staying power to be truthful i did reapply a bit of powder but not much and by the end of the day it stayed perfectly in place another plus is the price and the fact that bareminerals uses all natural products this way i know what 's actually going on my face by marlene 4 years ago it 's very difficult to make this foundation work alone it 's streaky and sits on the surface of the skin and does n't seem to blend in no matter what i try the only way i 've been able to use this is a drop or two mixed in with other foundations to help adjust the colour by sailynn 4 years ago i kind of like it but i do n't like it more it has a thin consistency there 's no fragrance but it smells like powder foundation i would not recommend this to dry or oily skin types i only recommend it to people who have normal skin with hardly any flaws if you 're looking for something to even out the skin tone this is it but it 's long lasting at all.and i 'm telling you this thing was born to streaky even after the foundation sets it 's still streaky but the longer you wear it the better it looks on your skin it emphasizes my hardly-visible fine lines it separates like wow on the face and it 's drying i actually feel this sitting on top of my skin it 's like when you put too much pressed powder on which is not pleasant.sucks it did n't work for me it was so hyped by holly 5 years ago i have tried just about everything to make this foundation work it is a very thin texture and spreads across skin easily but is extremely streaky and uneven no matter how much blending i do it never covers evenly i have applied it with fingers buffing brushes and sponges but i 've had no luck the coverage is billed as buildable but i have found it is only sheer on me and building creates that gross separated and oily look it settles into pores like it 's getting paid i 've tried to find some strengths in this foundation since i own it but it is so frustrating to work with that is consistently ends up in the back of my drawer with the other sad reject products.this just does n't work on my skin support
