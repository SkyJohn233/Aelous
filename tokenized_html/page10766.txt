only happens when the battery is totally dead or below 2 charge when i plug in the charger i get an icon indication there is water in the charging port the phone has never got wet and it only happens when the battery is basically dead when charging at any other time with battery above ~5 it s just fine to get past this i have to power off then on and let it sit at the decryption prompt until the charge gets to around 5 then i can complete the power on with no issues any thoughts thank-you solution the first thing that you should do in this particular case is to eliminate the charger as a possible cause to this problem clean the charging port of your phone using a can of compressed air then try using a different charging cord and wall charger to charge your phone if possible use a samsung branded cord and charger in case the issue persists then the next step is to check if a software glitch is the culprit to do this you need to backup your phone data then do a factory reset once the reset is complete do not install any apps in your phone yet try checking first if the issue still occurs if it does then i recommend that you bring your phone to a service center and have it

randomly won t charge via wall socket only works via usb have tried reset home and down button no better tried with phone off no better .. am i correct thinking this is software based issue how can i
