Format a calculated field as Date SQL Script for Qlik Sense - Stack Overflow                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 Database is in oracle, my machine has odbc 32 bits configured with the name PPM and I've created a script but need assistance formatting a calculated field: Imple, Contact, Analysis, Idea are all fields with same format of dates and this code is needed so we can have always the last date input as "Realdate" This gives back a correct Date in the new field (doesn't exist in the server) but shows many duplicates, using  SET TimestampFormat='MM-YYYY';  before, it gives back the dates with the correct format but shows "03-2015" 3 times and many others dates like that.   Trying also:  date(floor("REALDATE",'MM.YYYY') as "REALDATE2"  but since this is a calculated field I don't know how to make reference that field. Thanks In QlikView, the function Date#(expression [ , format-code ]) could help you. You can evaluate any expression with a specific date format. Hope this could help, but your question is not very clear, if you could add more information it would be very useful. Looks like Qlik is picking up the numeric value and needs to be converted to a date.  date#  is used to render date strings into a date value. I found a way around after long hours of trying: Could not format the field inside the script but this does the trick Thanks for the help!
