Go back Based on the paper "Spectral Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks" by Takeru Miyato, Toshiki Kataoka, Masanori Koyama, Yuichi Yoshida ICLR 2018 preprint: https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1QRgziT- This code implements both DCGAN-like and ResNet GAN architectures. In addition, training with standard, Wasserstein, and hinge losses is possible. To get ResNet working, initialization (Xavier/Glorot) turned out to be very important. Train ResNet generator and discriminator with hinge loss:  python main.py --model resnet --loss hinge Train ResNet generator and discriminator with wasserstein loss:  python main.py --model resnet --loss wasserstein Train DCGAN generator and discriminator with cross-entropy loss:  python main.py --model dcgan --loss bce
