Katie Campbell Spyrka | Consumer Blogs Working via the team at Speedo, I’ve supplied Wiggle with several blog features aimed at elevating Speedo’s online presence and sales. Blogs have included introductions to new and existing ranges, as well as swimming technique features such as  Triathlon tips: Open water swimming for beginners  and  Triathlon tips: 7 easy technique tweaks for a stronger arm stroke . I’ve written a huge number of feature-style blog entries for Speedo, the world’s most successful swim brand. Some I’ve written ‘from’ athletes, some from industry experts (elite coaches, motivational coaches and physiotherapists), some from bloggers, and others simply from Speedo. More often than not, the blog entries were structured as extended features, providing technique advice for swimming, triathlon and fitness. I was commissioned by Boots-owned cosmetic brand, 17, to write a series of blogs for their target market of teens and twenty-somethings. The posts, which covered current trends, celebrity get-the-looks, product news and make-up tips, sat on the 17 brand page on Boots.com. Writing in the style of Surfdome’s in-house bloggers, I created a blog post about  building strength and fitness , which also included a brief behind-the-brand element to introduce Surfdome customers to Speedo. Again, the aim was to build awareness of the Speedo brand, boost online presence and elevate sales. As part of my role as Boots.com’s freelance Beauty Editor, I wrote my own ‘Beauty Editor’s blog’ for several years. Other sites that I’ve written blog entries and features for (via Speedo) include House of Fraser, Total Fitness, DW Sports, and Elvery’s.
