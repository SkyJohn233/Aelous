Keki Tarapore - Wikipedia Keki Khurshedji Tarapore pronunciation ( help · info )  (17 December 1910,  Bombay  – 15 June 1986,  Pune ,  Maharashtra ) was an  Indian cricketer  who played in one  Test  in 1948. Tarapore played as the understudy to  Vinoo Mankad , the first of the three or four such left arm spinners, against  West Indies  in 1948-49. His short international career was thus described by  Sujit Mukherjee : While fielding at deep extra cover on the second day in this match, Tarapore injured his fingers while trying to stop a four hit by  Robert Christiani  off  Vinoo Mankad . He had to leave the field, and when he came back, the crowd barracked him every time he touched the ball.  [ 1 ] Four months after his only Test, Tarapore played his last first class match - the Ranji final between  Bombay  and  Baroda  - where he bowled 99 overs. Tarapore later went into cricket administration. He managed the Indian teams to England in 1967 and West Indies in 1970-71. He served as the secretary of  Cricket Club of India  from 1954 to 1982. He died after being knocked down by a  moped .
