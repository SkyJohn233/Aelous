yellow daisy oil painting oil painting daisy flowers abstract daisy paintings 1 i thought that was the perfect idea for my next abstract oil painting yellow daisy oil painting on a dark background should look spectacular next to my water lily don t you think i have started with a sketch then i have added a black background and had to do it twice to cover it perfectly even then i have painted a layer of cyan blue which is very transparent and made this super deep and background looks actually very dark blue not black at all i have also painted medium yellow underpainting for daisies pedals now i started adding al of the highlights and lowlights on the individual pedals along with shades of those pedals which are in front of the others little by little pedal by pedal this is a bit better picture and you can see the color of background too and few pedals more with all of their distinctive lines now i just added green heart to it and this little yellow daisy can keep our eyes happy we all know that a picture makes for a thousand of words so i will stop talking and let you enjoy the view red cup oil painting september 7 2016 in oil painting how i prepare for the art show july 21 2016 in oil painting muslim fest 2016 october 17 2016 in guests and events i love it so much kate yellow is my favourite colour and this painting would look amazing in my leaving room let me know if it is on sale comments are closed media error format s not supported or source s not found
