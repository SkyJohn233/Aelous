The Bangville Police (First Appearance of the Keystone Kops)   (Travalanche) Today is the anniversary of the release of  The Bangville Police , the comedy short containing what is considered by many to be the first appearance of  The Keystone Kops  (others consider the first to have been  1912 Hoffmeyer s Legacy).  To muddy the water some, the kops aren t uniformed in this one, they re an all-volunteer force in a rural community called Bangville, quite different from the urban Los Angeles settings we re accustomed to seeing the Kops run amok in. (One wonders if it isn t a riff on Essanay s  Snakeville  series). At any rate  Fred Mace  plays the head Kop in this one.  Ford Sterling , who normally plays the Kops  Chief is in it, but just as a regular officer. Other Kops in this film include  Edgar Kennedy ,  Hank Mann  and  Al St. John .  Mack Sennett  directed.  Mabel Normand  plays a young farm girl who thinks she hears robbers in the barn and calls the police in. After much brouhaha and fol-de-rol, the Kops arrive and break into the barn, only to find that all the commotion has been caused by   oh but wait! Why should I tell you? Here it is, you can see for yourself!
