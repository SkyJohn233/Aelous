HDMI help (no sound) - Xbox Association - GameSpot This topic is locked from further discussion. turn mute off 1. You have a bad HDMI cable or a noncompatible one. Maybe you need 1.3a? (Not quite sure) 2. There is something wrong with the HDMI output on your XBOX. 3. There is something wrong with the HDMI input on your TV. 4. Your sound settings are screwed up somehow on your TV. Unplug everything (that means yank the cord out of the wall) and reconnect in 5 minutes. Any One or a combination of these is your problem. Merry Christmas! that happened to me so i plugged in the yellow and red thingos into the same AV channel or whatever and then i got sound.... but just standard sound or maybe your tv set doesn't support audio on it's HDMI ports... I used to have a sharp LCD tv with a HDMI port with a rca audio input (red/white cables)... that's why the overpriced $50 official HDMI M$ kit includes a connector similar to the standar 360 cable with only the red/white outputs.. http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B000UODATY/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_0?ie=UTF8 =0  look if your tv set have the HDMI along with the red/white RCA cables right beside it. >< g>  Please  Log In  to post.
