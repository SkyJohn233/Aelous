Americans.” Maybe the title of the show referred to Paige and Henry all along. In the series finale of the FX drama “The Americans,” the Russian spies Elizabeth (Keri Russell) and Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys) very reluctantly left behind their teenage son, Henry (Keidrich Sellati), who had no knowledge of his parents’ secret lives of espionage, fake mustaches and murder. The couple went on the run with their adult daughter, Paige (Holly Taylor), who had been trained in spycraft by Elizabeth. But in the end, Paige chose to stay behind in America, the only country she and her brother had ever known. The most crucial moment of the finale — possibly of the series — comes when Paige surprises her parents by getting off the train that will take them out of the United States. After the train is in motion and they’re unable to go after her, Philip and Elizabeth see Paige standing on the platform, and their stunned reactions are heart-rending. In a phone interview, Ms. Russell and Mr. Rhys said they only got one or two takes for the critical train scenes. “Full disclosure, I have not seen the episode yet,” Ms. Russell said. “So I don’t know really how it turned out.” [  The “Americans” finale delivered a punishment that was well-deserved, yet unspeakably sad.  ] That sequence — like the rest of the mournful but ultimately satisfying finale — turned out exceptionally well. In the interview, Mr. Rhys and Ms. Russell, who are a couple in real life, discussed their characters’ fortunes and how “The Americans” stayed relatable, on an emotional and psychological basis, right until the end. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. How long have you known what the fate of your characters would be? When did the showrunners Joe Weisberg and Joel Fields tell you? KERI RUSSELL  I think they, for the past few years now, have known how they wanted it to end. But no, we did not hear about it until we read the finale script. That was about halfway through the season, when we both got a copy. What were your reactions?  RUSSELL  We were shooting north of the city and I had this big, four-hour chunk of downtime before my night work. I was a little behind on my reading, and so I took scripts 8, 9 and 10, and went to this fancy restaurant. I sat at the bar with a giant glass of red wine, and just sat and read them. I cried and tried to shield my eyes from the people in the restaurant so no one would know I was crying. At first, I was so surprised. And it’s devastating. It’s sort of the worst punishment of all. But at the same time, I loved the ending. MATTHEW RHYS  I was on a train to Washington, D.C., reading it and crying, trying not to let people see what was happening. I agree — I thought it was just a fitting end. It was going to come at a cost, but you don’t quite realize the extent of that cost. RUSSELL  One of our directors, Tommy Schlamme, said, “It’s so good, because even though you’re rooting for these characters, you want them to pay in some way.” And it’s in a way that everyone can relate to. Not everyone can relate to a big shootout, or someone going to prison for the rest of their lives. But anyone who’s a parent would know what that feeling would be like. I thought it was really good. [  ‘The Americans’ Finale recap: The world crashes in  ] There’s a trend in all kinds of entertainment to go big and have massive explosions and have lots of people die. But there can be a fate worse than death, if you’re taken away from what you know and the people you love. Advertisement RHYS  Absolutely. In the first season, there were elements of mission-of-the-week and guns and explosions. And [Mr. Weisberg and Mr. Fields] quickly realized that wasn’t what our show was, nor was it what they wanted it to be. It lived and it thrived on a far more human, relationship-based plane. What they did in letting Philip and Elizabeth go home is, they granted — obviously more for Elizabeth than Philip — a certain wish. But ultimately the cost at which that comes is enormous. These are the worst kind of “fatalities” for an ending, far more than a shootout. For Philip, coming to terms with his betrayal of Stan, both of them being away from their children, and Elizabeth knowing what Paige thinks of her — they’ll have to live with all of that. And the fact that that process will be ongoing — it really encapsulates “The Americans” and its nuanced approach to its characters.  RUSSELL  That’s what I love about it. Even though it is this spy show, and even though there are these action sequences and car chases, it always goes back to this somehow relatable marriage story. Those are the stories that always rise to the top. So this ending is still an ending about family dynamics. What is the most painful within that? That’s why it’s so appropriate. Philip letting Stan down, and having to look at that and live with the look on Stan’s face — the shock and the huge betrayal. And Elizabeth knowing what Paige thinks of her. Those are the real fireworks. What also makes it relatable is that if you are a parent, your kids are going to eventually grow up and move out. This was an incredibly wrenching version of that. Advertisement RUSSELL  And to think that those are her last moments with those kids. The last moments are Paige calling Elizabeth a whore, and then Elizabeth saying, “No, you can’t bring anything. We’re leaving right now. No, we’re going to leave your brother.” Just this massive panic and anxiety. That’s the world you’ve given them, and that’s what you’re going to leave her with. It’s so [expletive] up. And Henry, they were trying to leave him in this safe space. Leave him with his friends, where he’s happy and successful. He was outside all of it, and we haven’t messed him up. But we abandon him. It’s so awful. So you can’t win on any level. That’s why it’s so satisfying and heartbreaking at the same time. Do you speculate about Philip and Elizabeth’s lives in Russia — how they will live, and whether they will stay together? RUSSELL  I’d say there’d be a pretty edgy couple of years. Don’t you? RHYS  Yeah. RUSSELL  Or just sad. RHYS  Very sad. They’re the only two people who can truly understand what the other has been through. So the support they have for each other, the need, [is huge]. But with that comes great obstacles as well. I always hark back to the first episode of the first season, when Philip wanted to defect. Ultimately, in defection or witness protection, at least the four of them could’ve been together. So there may be some —— Advertisement RUSSELL  Resentment. RHYS  —— resentment on Philip’s behalf. But God, they’re both living in this purgatory about their kids. It doesn’t bear thinking about. RUSSELL  As audience members, we have this peripheral, small sliver of hope. We have the knowledge that communism doesn’t win, and the Berlin Wall does come down. And the hope in the back of your mind is that those few hard years will happen, and then they’ll be able to go back and find their kids. They’ll start a slow rebuilding. That’s the only thing I have to hang on to. There were a lot of difficult moments, but the most heartbreaking is when they see Paige on the platform. Was that a difficult scene to pull off? RUSSELL  It’s everything I love in a story. Our job is such a circus life. We’re always leaving or going or working somewhere far away. There’s something really emotional, always, about a moving vehicle — a train leaving or a car driving away. It adds something. So that train pulling away from the child is devastating to me. Also the way Paige looks — she’s not sobbing. She’s just looking at us like, “I’m not going.” It’s devastating to me. Especially after the loss of Henry. Advertisement Was it technically difficult, filming that on the train?  RUSSELL  The actual shooting that day was tricky. Obviously we were working with a real train, and it takes a million people to start the train, to get the train moving, then to get all those people in the shot. We were shooting on a Sunday. We had so many extras. We had to have extra crew because of that. So there were a lot of factors that were a little distracting, and made it not so easy. You kind of had to just show up and do your best in a couple of takes. RHYS  I felt enormous pressure. The train was moving away, and we only had one shot of it linking us and Paige. So I do tend to get a little pressured in those moments about getting it right. It’s kind of the worst thing, because then you overthink something. When you know you can have a second take and you can keep rolling, you’re far more relaxed and you can try it a couple of different ways. When they go, “Sorry, we’re only going to get one shot,” you go, “But it’s such an enormous moment!” This season, was it hard sometimes to understand where your characters were coming from? Some really brutal things went down, even more than usual.  RUSSELL  Inevitably every season, there’s been a point at which I send an email to Joe and Joel and go, “Guys. Seriously. I actually want Elizabeth to die now. This is irredeemable.” And then in this season especially, there got to be a point where I was just like, “Guys. Come on. Are we teeing her up to be [so bad that when she is] killed in the most gruesome way possible, we feel good about it?” But they’re just like, “Just hang in there, hang in there. It’s going to work out.” And they’re always right. This was such a cool job. Because Elizabeth got to stay Elizabeth for so long. It’s so rare. Usually the character has to become soft, or they’re transformed a little bit to make them more likable. And I feel like they didn’t really do that with Elizabeth. She got to stay herself, and she didn’t change until the 11th hour. Advertisement Did Elizabeth lie to Paige about the true nature of the job — things like having sex with targets and killing people — because she wanted to shield her from the reality as long as she could? Or because Elizabeth herself couldn’t face what she’d had to do? RUSSELL  I think it’s much simpler than that. What Elizabeth and Philip do is so incredibly specialized. What Elizabeth and Philip expected Paige to do was nowhere near what they did themselves. I think they expected her to be trained, to possibly work in a senator’s office pushing papers, and maybe occasionally she’d have access to something and make photocopies. I don’t think it was ever in the cards to train Paige to start turning tricks in hotel rooms. Naïvely, you become a parent and you get this idea that your kids are stupid and never going to find anything out. I don’t think Elizabeth thought she would ever have to explain that to Paige. She wanted such a different life for Paige, and I don’t think she ever thought it would catch up with her. Her escalating arguments with Paige get back to what you said about the show being relatable. Because most parents have those moments where they’re like, “Uh oh — my image is cracking.” Advertisement RUSSELL  Massively. That’s what this whole season was for Elizabeth and Paige. It was this huge ticking bomb — the poison pill in the necklace, the mortality: ”I have to tell her everything that she needs to know about the world, because if I die, she needs to know, and I can present it in the way it should be presented.” The sad irony is that Elizabeth did make a turn. She made a huge turn to think for herself and to make her own choices and leave the Center, and to side more with Philip. But it still comes crashing back to her in the context of a teenage daughter saying “You’re a whore” to her. She was almost out. She probably was about to never do it again. And it’s still thrown in her face. It seems like you were happy with how it all resolved. RUSSELL  I thought the ending felt so right. I can’t imagine a different ending now. RHYS  I could. RUSSELL  What’s your ending? RHYS  Gunfire. No, I couldn’t have wished for a better ending. Maybe this shows how limited I am, but I could’ve never imagined that ending, that they could’ve taken us on the roller coaster that they did. I remain a little surprised — not in a bad way — that none of the four family members died. Claudia didn’t die, Stan didn’t die. Advertisement RHYS  I love the fact that no one died. In the zeitgeist — sorry to use that word — a lot of people do die in finales, whether they should or not. And so maybe one of our great U-turns is that no one does die. The greatest death, as we’ve been discussing, is the family. And also in a couple years, Soviet Russia. RUSSELL  Exactly. RHYS  The greater family. Thinking about that, do you start to wonder, was all their sacrifice for nothing? Does that weigh on them? RUSSELL  That shot of them entering Russia — it’s pretty heavy. Like, “Was all of this worth it?” RHYS  These two were plucked at an incredibly early age to do this. They were indoctrinated. It wasn’t a choice that came later in life with maturity and hind- and foresight. They entered into this at a very early age, heavily influenced by the Second World War. What you saw in Philip was someone emerging from that going, “Actually, this isn’t right. And it’s not for me. I can’t actually do this. Regardless of how much it serves my country, I’m actually not cut out for this. I want my kids to be O.K.” Did you keep the cowboy boots? RHYS  No! At the end of that day [shooting a Season 6 line-dancing scene], I threw them into some trash bin, never to be seen again. Because that was my worst day on “The Americans.” Advertisement Why? RHYS  Because that truly is my Waterloo — having to dance publicly. I love that scene! RHYS  I’m glad the humiliation was worth it. This was all a covert operation to find out what will humiliate Matthew Rhys.  RHYS  It’s very easy. Just make me dance publicly and I’ll be scarred for life.
