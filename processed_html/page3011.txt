Upon its release,  Kamaal the Abstract  received positive reviews from most music critics. An eclectic album, [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Kamaal the Abstract  serves as a departure from Q-Tip's debut album  Amplified  (1999), which is more mainstream-oriented in its style and production approach. [ 4 ]  The album has Q-Tip  rapping , singing, and exploring his  jazz  influences. [ 5 ]  While it contains elements of  hip hop ,  pop , and  rock music , the album's improvisational sound is generally rooted in jazz and  funk . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  The album's songs mostly feature loose arrangements that provide space for improvisation. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]  Its instrumentation is characterized by electric piano, flute playing, deep organs, guitar-fuelled grooves, and improvised solos. [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  On its musical style, music critic John Bush wrote that  Kamaal the Abstract  "pays homage to the last gasp of organically produced mainstream pop in the '70s and '80s, paying a large compliment to  Prince  and  Stevie Wonder ". [ 8 ] The album has been compared by writers to soul and funk-oriented albums such as  D'Angelo 's  Voodoo  (2000),  André 3000 's  The Love Below  (2003), and Prince's  Musicology  (2004), [ 7 ]  as well as the hip hop/neo soul work of the  Soulquarians  collective. [ 12 ]  In his book  To the Break of Dawn: A Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic  (2007), music writer William Jelani Cobb cited  Kamaal the Abstract , along with  The Roots '  Phrenology  (2002),  Mos Def 's  Black on Both Sides  (1999),  Common 's  Electric Circus  (2002), and the work of  Jill Scott  and  Erykah Badu , as a "genre-bending" effort at musical expansion of hip hop. [ 13 ] — Brendan Mahoney,  Tiny Mix Tapes Kamaal the Abstract  contains introspective lyrical themes. [ 2 ]  Opening with the album's only rock  chord , [ 4 ]  the opening track "Feelin' It" is one of the album's few tracks with him rapping and it contains one verse about common life experiences and hassles. [ 14 ]  It introduces Q-Tip on his way to a recording studio, [ 4 ]  during which he is stopped by a police officer who  profiles  him: "This profiling cop with his profiling ass / Figured the best thing he could do was find a cat to harass. / The little kitten was me, not that one in the tree / The black one with the promise and the wish to be free". [ 15 ]  The lyrics are based on an experience that Q-Tip had with a policeman. [ 3 ]  John Murph of  Jazz Times  interpreted the song's verse as a metaphor for Q-Tip's struggles for absolute creative freedom without resulting in critical backlash. [ 3 ] Tiny Mix Tapes ' s Brendan Mahoney interpreted the "profilin' cop" in the song as "another mundane and too-predictable distraction in a world full of them". [ 4 ] Songs such as "Blue Girl" and "Heels" demonstrate Q-Tip's female-identified perspective on  Kamaal the Abstract . [ 9 ]  "Do U Dig U?" has philosophically minded lyrics that deal with existential detachment. [ 3 ] [ 14 ]  "Barely in Love" concerns the powerful nature of love with lyrics about two lovers that are together based on physical attraction. [ 3 ] [ 14 ]  The album's closing track, "Even If It Is So", is an ode to single parenting and discusses a hard-working mother. [ 2 ] Q-Tip began recording for the album after being signed to  Arista Records  by record executive  Clive Davis . [ 2 ]  However, he was left to lobby the progressive project to Arista's new administration after Davis left the label. [ 2 ]  Originally scheduled for an October 23, 2001 release date, [ 16 ]  and later pushed back to April 23, 2002, the album was shelved by Arista, doubting its commercial potential. [ 17 ]  It was originally set to be released with the title  Abstractions , which served as the title for the album's  promo LP  (2001). [ 18 ]  Q-Tip later said in an interview for  The Village Voice : Q-Tip was upset over the album's shelving and felt that although Reid did not know how to market it, his label released  OutKast 's  Speakerboxxx/The Love Below  in 2003: "[T]hose are the kinds of sounds that are on  Kamaal the Abstract . Maybe even a little more out [than OutKast].  Kamaal  was just me, guerrilla". [ 20 ]  While it did not receive an official release, advanced promotional copies made their way into the public,  leaking  to the  Internet . [ 21 ] In 2006, Q-Tip announced that he was in negotiations to regain control of the album from Arista/BMG and planned on officially releasing it in 2007. [ 22 ]  On July 1, 2009,  Jive Records  announced that it would release the album through its  Battery  imprint. [ 23 ]  The U.S. compact disc release was issued with the bonus track "Make It Work", [ 24 ]  and the double LP release was that song and "Damn You're Cool". [ 25 ]  "Barely in Love" was released on September 1, 2009, as the album's first  single . [ 26 ] Kamaal the Abstract  subsequently debuted at number 77 on the U.S.  Billboard  200  chart, selling 6,000 copies in its first week. [ 27 ]  It also peaked at number 32 on the  Top R & B/Hip-Hop Albums , at number 12 on the  Independent Albums , and at number 17 on the  Top Rap Albums  chart. [ 28 ] Kamaal the Abstract  received generally positive reviews from  music critics . [ 29 ]  At  Metacritic , which assigns a  normalized  rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an  average  score of 78, based on 13 reviews. [ 29 ]  Amid  Kamaal the Abstract ' s original planned release, promotional copies had been distributed and several publications ran reviews of the album. [ 5 ] AllMusic  writer John Bush considered it superior to Q-Tip's debut album  Amplified . [ 8 ] Slant Magazine  editor Sal Cinquemani called the album "a genre-defying blend of nü-jazz, '70s soul, rock, and funk". [ 35 ]  Despite writing that it does not reach its potential, Karen R. Good of  Vibe  perceived it as a progression from  Amplified  and described it as "closer to the rooted,  love-sexy  album we, the people, expect from  the musicologist ". [ 9 ] Entertainment Weekly ' s  David Browne  called the album "one of the most head-scratching albums ever made by a prominent rapper", commenting that it "feels like a worthy experiment abandoned halfway through; it doesn't end so much as nod off". [ 10 ]  Nathan Rabin of  The A.V. Club  wrote that the album "sounds like the sort of disc that gets rappers released from their contracts … it's invigorating to listen to a relaxed and playful Q-Tip follow his muse ever further off the beaten path". [ 30 ] Blender  complimented Q-Tip's musicianship and gave the album four out of five stars. [ 31 ] The New Zealand Herald  gave the album four out of four stars upon its 2009 release, [ 36 ]  noting that Q-Tip "came up with something timeless then – and nine years on it sounds fresh, inventive and cosmic", and adding that the album has a "unique coolness to it and it still sounds ahead of its time in 2009". [ 36 ]  However,  Robert Christgau  named it "dud of the month" in his consumer guide for  MSN Music , in which he wrote that most of the tracks are musically incomplete and, "in the narrow sense of rhythm tracks, the beats have some ass to them, but as music they revert to fusion kitsch whenever the artiste sees an opening". [ 32 ] Pitchfork  critic David Drake commented that " Kamaal the Abstract  is not a great record by any means. But it is an interesting one, a unique effort by an artist struggling to mesh [jazz and hip hop]", viewing that "each track is a loose framework of unfulfilled promise". [ 33 ]  William Grant of  Drowned in Sound  viewed that it "seems a bit aimless at times", but ultimately praised its diverse sound and gave it an eight out of 10 rating. [ 37 ]  Dave Heaton of  PopMatters  commented that the album is "mainly about feeling. There’s no storytelling meat to the songs, less wit, not much of Q-Tip’s creative approach to language. It’s mostly about riding the groove, and that Q-Tip does well". [ 34 ] All tracks were produced by Q-Tip. [ 24 ] Credits for  Kamaal the Abstract  adapted from liner notes. [ 24 ]
