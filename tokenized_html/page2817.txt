pumpkin spice blondies are what autumn dreams are made of subtly sweet and seasonally spiced these blondies are the perfect compliment to an afternoon cup of coffee while soaking up the cool fall breeze parenting it s a job/calling that largely consists of boundary setting rule enforcing and tough love i know as a mom that my main job is to raise decent kind contributing human beings doing this means that my kids aren t always happy with me c est la vie in my opinion a parent has to be comfortable saying no and sticking her guns but but every so often there comes a day when i just don t want to say no again take yesterday it was a busy morning for us all once i had the girls piled up and ready to head home at 12:30 for lunch everything became a battle i had to ask them to buckle their seat belts more than 10 billion times meanwhile they climbed over the backseats pushing every button they could find and inevitably falling into each other resulting in tears then the ride home was fighting over which music to play and whining about what the rest of the day entailed by the time we got home i was done i handed them some cheese in a tortilla gave them about 5 minutes to eat it then sent them straight to their beds for quiet time i had plenty i needed to do but first i face planted into my bed and just concentrated on breathing quiet time gave me a little over an hour to chill recollect myself and feel the fall breeze through my window quiettimeforever or at least until age 18 i didn t want to be this mom today we are smackdab in the middle of my favorite season and i didn t want to let this perfect afternoon pass me by i promised myself i d get up extra early tomorrow tackle my list and just be fun mom for the afternoon and fun mom i was my house was actually clean for once but i still let the girls crack the egg and mix the flour mess equals memories and i fought my ocd clean-as-you-go instincts with all my might so i could be in the moment the girls sniffed the spices and sampled the gredients shockingly enough brown sugar was their fav i didn t try to add flax seeds or go halfway with whole wheat flour we just went for it sugar butter cinnamon and spices in all their beautiful fall glory at the end we had a messy kitchen and one 8 8 dish full of warm pumpkin spice blondies one bite lead to mmm s all around as the girls congratulated each other on their culinary success and i have to agree these pumpkin spice blondies are the perfect compliment to an afternoon cup of coffee when the leaves are rustling and the breeze blows through the screen just light that leaves candle and reach for one of these i promise you this is what autumn dreams are made of they are subtly sweet and perfectly spiced i highly suggest making these for weekend company or just for yourself if you are in need of a moment of fall zen and if you want to serve it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream well you might just be a genius these pumpkin spice

desserts treats kid approved recipes vegetarian tag ahealthyslice on instagram and hashtag it ahsinthekitchen with blondies in our tummies we were all in better spirits i didn t want to delay the fun so i snapped a few quick pictures then we all headed outside we enjoyed a fall walk picking up leaves and collecting acorns for squirrels then piled up on the couch to watch mickey s house of villians currently streaming on netflix fyi yes it s important to me to be a firm parent but trading in an occasional afternoon battle in favor of blondies and snuggles is where the memories are made now go

look and sound great i do have a question is there pumpkin in these the girls are so cute they are both getting so big hope you have a great week thanks karen brittany dixon says october 31 2016 at 9:12 am hi karen there is no actual pumpkin in this particular recipe but is perfectly pumpkin spiced kind of like the latte i love the idea of adding real pumpkin so maybe i ll try a version like that next time thanks for the suggestion jessie the acquired sass says october 31 2016 at 10:24 am came back to note i used pumpkin pie spice 3tsp in place of all listed spice added a huge spoonful of regular pumpkin which would equate to somewhere between 1/4 1/3 cup i had to bake 5 minutes longer but they were delicious super moist and pumpkiny a little dense compared to what i was expecting but in a good way shelly says november 23 2016 at 1:00 pm i know you posted this awhile ago but did you use salted or unsalted butter thanks and happy thanksgiving brittany dixon says november 27 2016 at 8:09 pm hi shelly i m so sorry it took me so long to reply i used unsalted butter i hope you had a wonderful thanksgiving your email address will not be published required fields are marked rate this
