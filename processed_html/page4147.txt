Dinner is served every evening to residents at the Salvation Army Ventura transitional living center. (Photo: CHUCK KIRMAN/THE STAR) Buy Photo The Salvation Army  has been helping the homeless get off Ventura's streets for more than 50 years. Its transitional living center  — which offers warm meals, a housing specialist and a jobs specialist — is one of the beneficiaries of this year's Julius Gius Bellringer Campaign, run by the Ventura County Star. VENTURA COUNTY STAR Bellringer: Camarillo couple expands giving “This money we raise helps us to support our programs for an entire year,” said Lt. Silvia Benetti Simoes, a Ventura Corps officer and spokeswoman for the Salvation Army Southern California Division. The Star is also partnering with Project Safe Passage, Senior Concerns and the American Red Cross. People can donate to the Bellringer campaign through Christmas by mailing donations or contributing online or by credit card. VENTURA COUNTY STAR Bellringer: Pet ' s death prompts charitable giving The Bellringer drive started in 1979 when Gius, editor of what was then the Star-Free Press, called on readers to help after some shopping centers prohibited the Salvation Army’s donation kettles. According to Benetti Simoes, money received by the Salvation Army from this year’s Bellringer drive will go to support the Ventura transitional living program as it changes its mission from serving families to serving single adults. She said the Salvation Army will continue to offer help for homeless families through other programs. “We have food pantries where families can come once a month, and we will provide food," she said. "But we really want to keep the transitional living center running well, so the money will go for that.” VENTURA COUNTY STAR Bellringer: Hawaii Club lends helping hand Throughout Ventura County, Salvation Army homelessness prevention programs offer food, utility and rental assistance. The Salvation Army also runs a free dental clinic at its facility in Oxnard that offers cleanings, X-rays and simple procedures for low-income and homeless clients." "We also have a homeless outreach program for families, which helps us provide case management to those willing to be part of our program,” Benetti Simoes said. The Ventura transitional living facility needs extra support this year as it focuses on serving single men and women at its nine-apartment facility. “We’re not going to be able to have families," Benetti Simoes said. "Each room can hold four people, and there are nine rooms. In the dorms, we have 11 people, as well.” Participating in the Bellringer program is a way to get out into the community, she said. “We are a Christian organization," she said. "Our mission here is to share the Gospel with people in need. What we do, besides offering help, is a crucial service. We are working with the church and the program, hearing God’s word and being with him. We believe the only way they really can get back to their lives is when they really understand about God’s word and they see there is hope. We share the hope.” VENTURA COUNTY STAR Star ' s Bellringer campaign helps 4 groups this year To donate, visit  https://www.vcstar.com/bellringer  or fill out the form found daily in The Star through Dec. 25 and mail it to Ventura County Star Bellringer, P.O.
