Anushka Sharma Just Exposed the Sexism in Bollywood \r\nAnd she's bang on point!\r\n\r\n ​Ladies and gentleman, Anushka Sharma has arrived. Seriously! In a recent interview with film critic and TV show host Anupama Chopra, the actor and producer (she produced NH10 and has three more in the works) said a number of things that have literally put her in the limelight. Yes, some of the interview was about Virat Kohli, and yes, she spoke about upcoming projects, but the part that's worth the money is where she talks about the sexism that exists in Bollywood. And might I add, she does it candidly, and with flair. 2015 has definitely been a year for women.  Tanu Weds Manu Returns ,  Piku ,  Margarita, With A Straw , and  NH10 , these were only some of the movies that garnered appraise and accolades galore. And the fact that they all have female protagonists is worth a mention.  So, it's amazing to see a mega screen actor like Anushka Sharma to actually talk about the stuff that's bothering everyone. And she really does hit the nail on the head. Every. Single. Time. Here, check out her full interview. And make sure you pay special attention when the video reaches 8 minutes and 30 seconds. That' s when she gets talking! [youtube ]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4X9YlbOq24 & feature=youtu.be[/youtube] So here's the deal! The fact that a female character plays second fiddle to the script and the hero of a film is a brutal reality. The fact that men's careers last longer than women's in this industry (because women are no longer \"desirable\" after a certain age) is another harsh reality. And there is also the fact that no matter what, men are paid more than women. Because that's just how it is.  We need to change that. We need to realise that female actors aren't being \"difficult\" or showing \"attitude\" by giving suggestions, or asking for what they deserve. And when you don't give them that, you're telling them that they're not \"valuable\" enough. And that's why we need women from the industry to speak up. To step up and take charge and make movies like  NH10  and  Margarita, With A Straw  so that women can take centre stage. And sure, 2015 was a good year, but let's hope 2016 is better. There are a lot of female characters waiting to beat the sh*t out goons with an iron rod.
