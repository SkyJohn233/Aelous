tomato sauce homemade with an upgrade homemade with an upgrade a light-hearted serious passion for making and eating good food remember how i didn t blog very much last fall that s because i was living it up in italy bobby and i went for two weeks to see venice and rome and belgium at the beginning of the trip but that doesn t really fit the theme venice is the most magnificent place i ve ever been in my whole life and i miss it constantly i ate pizza for lunch and pasta for dinner nearly every day and i have zero regrets here s a quick peek at our trip is it time for me to go back yet upon returning home i was obsessed with getting my mom s recipe for tomato sauce she s been working on it for years and i don t think i had a proper appreciation for good tomato sauce until i went on this trip my mom s sauce is aptly named tinkered tomato sauce since she experimented with it for so long before getting it just right it has that bright tomato flavor deep warm garlic base and bold spices that are sautéed in olive oil at the beginning of the cooking process to help them become as rich and aromatic as possible this sauce is good on homemade pizza or as a pasta topping and it ll make you want to never buy a jar of sauce off the shelf again it s easy to make too – and you can make an enormous batch and freeze some until you need more the holidays and the fall wedding season took over my life when we got back from our trip so try not to hold it against me that it s taken me this long to share of course once you taste it you probably will hold it against me since it s that wonderful but i hope we can get past that now go make some and pretend you re in a gondola drifting down a canal in venice as someone feeds you pizza and the gondolier sings…instead of talking on his cell phone like he did for us saute the onion in the olive oil until soft while it is cooking crush all the herbs and spices except the red pepper with mortar and pestle and immediately add to the onion at least 5 mins cooking time for the herbs etc stir in the garlic and crushed red pepper and saute for 1 minute longer stir in the remaining ingredients simmer over low heat for 30 – 45 minutes taste and adjust add more salt if desired can be put through the blender and strained for a smoother sauce which allows use of chopped instead of crushed tomatoes and a rougher chop of the onion and garlic it will be quite thin after straining adsbygoogle window.adsbygoogle || .push amzn_assoc_placement adunit0 amzn_assoc_search_bar true amzn_assoc_tracking_id homwitanupg-20 amzn_assoc_ad_mode manual amzn_assoc_ad_type smart amzn_assoc_marketplace amazon amzn_assoc_region us amzn_assoc_title my amazon picks amzn_assoc_linkid cd34fde6c88b02cbea6facc3b0d6a051 amzn_assoc_asins b000ws3apw b004uluvu4 b004yv6154 b000ws08yi welcome to my kitchen my name is kate and i m so happy you ve found my site this may look like a typical food blog but it s more like my homage to food
