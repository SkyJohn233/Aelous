x2019 s often at the jim norick arena in oklahoma city during either the national reining horse association derby or futurity riders and trainers fantasize about being crowned the nrha futurity champion the penultimate title breeders hope they x2019 ve produced the next prospect to wear the roses owners dream of taking those roses home to their mantels it s a lofty goal for a diy rider rarely are all four of those people x2014 rider trainer breeder and owner x2014 under one hat but when you x2019 re the ultimate do-it-yourself non-pro the stars can align for that to occur as they did for sandra bentien at the 2016 nrha futurity make believe sandra doesn x2019 t remember a time when she wasn x2019 t horse crazy x2014 it was literally love at first sight when she saw her first horse at age 3 when she turned 5 her dad and grandfather brought home for her a black shetland pony she named thunder x201c it was the best day of my life x201d sandra recalls that memorable day spurred on a friendship that would mold sandra into the horsewoman she is today sandra credits the tiny wonder with teaching her important lessons and filling empty spaces in her life thunder would run along home next to sandra every day and he x2019 d be her partner in any make-believe play action x2014 from cowboys and indians to playing horse show to being a famous racehorse and jockey in what might x2019 ve been a prelude to her future horse life the precocious pony also taught sandra about hard stops most times dumping the young rider in the dirt x201c i spent hours every day riding bareback with a huge imagination x201d she says x201c there was nothing we couldn x2019 t do x201d pinterest-pin-it courtesy of sandra bentien pinterest-pin-it a pony named thunder top photo black pony spurred sandra s passion for all things horse and started her journey as a diy rider the fun-sized mount took her to the local barn where she watched more experienced riders the girls inspired sandra to save money to upgrade her mount and begin competing in open shows she worked her way through her horse x2019 s perceived shortcomings by reading books and watching how other riders worked with their horses this all led to her big moments winning major national reining horse association events aboard homebred and -trained mounts waltenberry one of their usual excursions included a ride to the local boarding barn where sandra watched the x201c horse show girls x201d ride their trained quarter horses x201c the girls were very nice to me and sometimes they x2019 d lead me around on their big horses x201d she recalls x201c eventually they x2019 d allow me to walk and jog i was about 8 years old when one of them invited me to show her horse in a couple walk-jog classes at a local open show x201d that day stoked the flames of her passion after earning top-five finishes sandra wanted to show more but her parents didn x2019 t have the money for her to take lessons or get a fancy show horse x201c so my show career amounted to pretending on thunder x201d she says over the next few years sandra x2019 s dad brought home horses that he got cheap or as a trade-in at his car dealership she remembers none of them being well-trained and some were even dangerous so they didn x2019 t stay long on the family farm at one point her dad told her that if she wanted a better horse she x2019 d need to sell thunder sandra refused x201c i rode that pony until my feet were practically dragging the ground x201d sandra laughs x201c one day i rode up to my dad who was with a bunch of his friends and they started teasing my dad about not getting me a x2018 big horse x2019 my dad made me a deal x2014 he x2019 d match whatever i saved up to buy my own horse x201d sandra took on odd jobs to save up 400 true to his word her father matched her total she used the funds to purchase an 8-year-old black quarter horse gelding named 3l rackum bar or x201c 38 x201d as they called him after sandra x2019 s dad x2019 s favorite gun the former ranch and barrel horse was quite the handful but the 12-year-old equestrian was determined to make him a show horse x201c at times i thought the prancing and head-tossing horse would never make a show horse x201d she recalls x201c he wore my patience like none other he wasn x2019 t a confident horse and was always very nervous but he was what i had and i was a determined young girl x201d sandra read horse-training books watched competitors in the warm-up arena listened to trainers talk among themselves and with their clients and absorbed everything like a sponge x201c i x2019 d think about what was being done and how it may affect the horse and then go home and apply it to 38 x201d she says x201c eventually a change began to occur in the horse and he started to blossom into a show horse x201d after that epiphany the pair competed in showmanship horsemanship western pleasure english pleasure and equitation amassing many ribbons and year-end awards at local open and aqha shows x201c he wasn x2019 t a standout in any one event but he was good in all of them x201d she admits diy non-pro show tips sandra bentien has

on time x2022 prior to the event make a list of everything you x2019 ll need x2022 if you x2019 re stabling overnight order your shavings ahead of time so they x2019 re at your stalls when you arrive

so make the show less work and more fun x2022 learn how your horse likes to be prepared to show is he the kind that needs to be longed and allowed to play before getting saddled does he need to be worked until he x2019 s a little tired then taken back to his stall to drink and urinate if might take multiple classes and shows to know what your horse likes to perform his best but it x2019 s worth the time and trouble reality check during this time a local trainer took sandra under her wing with sandra working off her occasional lessons at the barn after a lot of thought sandra traded in 38 for a yearling quarter horse filly named jiggy bar jasmine at just 15 sandra started her first horse under saddle x201c starting a young horse was such an amazing confidence builder and it was at this time i myself began to blossom x201d she says x201c i felt empowered teaching a horse and seeing the results it was so exciting and rewarding for me x201d pinterest-pin-it courtesy of sandra bentien

bentien the pair successfully competed in all-around events through the years until life happened after getting married young sandra became pregnant to stay active in the horse-show world she decided to sell jasmine and purchase a halter mare x201c it was a bit easier fitting a halter horse than riding and training one with a baby x201d she says after another successful endeavor including trips to the aqha open and amateur world shows sandra and her family moved from their hometown in lancaster california to follow her parents to northern california a friend was interested in her halter mare so sandra traded the halter horse for another mare this one had been shown at the national reined cow horse association snaffle bit futurity and was a good ranch-type horse being a daughter of dry doc

she found herself working two jobs as a single mom after getting remarried she knew it was time to get her first real reiner in january 2001 she purchased a 4-year-old stallion named custom slider from trainer steve simon x201c slider set the bar high for my future in reining x201d sandra admits x201c he taught me so much and was so patient with me since then i x2019 ve never looked back x201d sliding forward as any horse lover knows a horse x2019 s athleticism and movement can be captivating one of the best ways to see that poetry in motion is by watching reining and that x2019 s what drew sandra to the sport x201c i loved the precision and the beauty of what a reining horse can do physically x201d she says x201c being one that was always drawn to dressage and the relationship between the horse and rider but not interested in riding english it was natural for me to be drawn to reining x201d while she considers most of her riding ability natural and self-taught sandra knew that to be successful in the increasingly competitive sport of reining she needed to seek outside help while living in northern california sandra took lessons from area professionals gathering pieces of knowledge and sport-specific skills to apply to her horses herself x201c i learned a lot but i found that i enjoyed training my own horse too much to let someone else do it x201d she admits x201c it might x2019 ve taken me longer to get things accomplished but i formed an invaluable partnership with my horse and knew him inside and out x201d the cost of full-time training was another reason the budget-minded competitor didn x2019 t keep a horse in a show barn special ties doing your own training means spending countless more hours in the saddle than just a ride at the trainer x2019 s but those are hours sandra wouldn x2019 t trade for anything she relishes the knowledge that she encouraged and x201c owns x201d every button and every maneuver x201c training my own horse makes me a

she develops with each horse as x201c spiritual x201d one such special tie is with her mare make it with a twist x201c i x2019 ve had lots of special horses in my 43 years as a horse owner but she took it to a whole new level x201d sandra says x201c she made me look good and made me a trainer she showed me what it was to feel pure raw natural ability x201d sandra purchased x201c honey x201d

honey x2019 s son got ta twist it up x201c he and i share the same bond that honey and i have it x2019 s a pretty intense relationship one that i cherish and hope that everyone gets to experience
