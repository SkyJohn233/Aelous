Nucleic acids are the main information-carrying molecules of the  cell , and, by directing the process of  protein synthesis , they determine the inherited characteristics of every living thing. The two main classes of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) and ribonucleic acid ( RNA ). DNA is the master blueprint for life and  constitutes  the genetic material in all free-living organisms and most viruses. RNA is the genetic material of certain viruses, but it is also found in all living cells, where it plays an important role in certain processes such as the making of proteins. This article covers the  chemistry  of nucleic acids, describing the structures and properties that allow them to serve as the transmitters of genetic information. For a discussion of the  genetic code ,  see heredity , and for a discussion of the role played by nucleic acids in protein synthesis,  see metabolism . Nucleic acids are polynucleotides—that is, long chainlike molecules composed of a series of nearly identical building blocks called  nucleotides . Each  nucleotide  consists of a nitrogen-containing aromatic base attached to a pentose (five-carbon)  sugar , which is in turn attached to a  phosphate  group. Each nucleic acid contains four of five possible nitrogen-containing  base s:  adenine  (A),  guanine  (G),  cytosine  (C),  thymine  (T), and  uracil  (U). A and G are categorized as  purines , and  C , T, and U are collectively called  pyrimidines . All nucleic acids contain the bases A, C, and G; T, however, is found only in DNA, while U is found in RNA. The pentose sugar in DNA ( 2′-deoxyribose ) differs from the sugar in RNA (ribose) by the absence of a hydroxyl group (―OH) on the 2′ carbon of the sugar ring. Without an attached phosphate group, the sugar attached to one of the bases is known as a  nucleoside . The phosphate group connects successive sugar residues by bridging the 5′-hydroxyl group on one sugar to the 3′-hydroxyl group of the next sugar in the chain. These nucleoside linkages are called phosphodiester bonds and are the same in RNA and DNA. Nucleotides are synthesized from readily available  precursors  in the cell. The  ribose  phosphate portion of both  purine  and  pyrimidine  nucleotides is synthesized from  glucose  via the pentose phosphate pathway. The six-atom pyrimidine ring is synthesized first and subsequently attached to the ribose phosphate. The two rings in purines are synthesized while attached to the ribose phosphate during the assembly of adenine or guanine nucleosides. In both cases the end product is a nucleotide carrying a phosphate attached to the 5′ carbon on the sugar. Finally, a specialized  enzyme  called a kinase adds two phosphate groups using  adenosine triphosphate  (ATP) as the phosphate donor to form ribonucleoside triphosphate, the immediate  precursor  of RNA. For DNA, the 2′-hydroxyl group is removed from the ribonucleoside diphosphate to give deoxyribonucleoside diphosphate. An additional phosphate group from ATP is then added by another kinase to form a deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, the immediate precursor of DNA. During normal cell metabolism, RNA is constantly being made and broken down. The purine and pyrimidine residues are reused by several salvage pathways to make more genetic material. Purine is salvaged in the form of the corresponding nucleotide, whereas pyrimidine is salvaged as the nucleoside.
