masochism you ll surely be fit to spit yer teeth out the tawse that kept scots kids well-behaved for a century or more or better still take a good old-fashioned tawse to the obnoxious young swine which is what the school near basel should have done when they started their uppity cr p we covered this display of alien arrogance a week or so back two recalcitrant juvenile jihadists who won t shake their teacher s hand but we learn much more by perusal of the local the pair come across as artful dodgers at best the brats are two syrian brothers – the sons of an imam and their fanaticism is at once clear to anyone wo lives here in jakarta where 90 of the people are muslim but show few signs of the brat-drivel which claims muslims may not have physical contact with a person of the opposite sex aside from immediate family members there was no reference in the koran justifying a refusal to shake a woman teacher s hand said the swiss federation of islamic organisations saida keller-messahli of the forum for progressive islam urged the swiss not to give in to extremist demands http //www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35967349 here in 90 muslim jakarta hand-shakes are the norm with both males and females of every age and class most people are polite as said before i can recall only a couple of times in the best part of two decades in indonesia when i ve encountered refusal to do so a quick aside the swiss report does make one reflect on the judgement of the children s commissioner for england who recently shrilled that cameron should get a move on and bring in a fresh batch of brats from the calais jungle ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo and who among you believes this unfortunately the media gave these two toe-rags a platform without revealing their identities we re not harming anyone said the younger of the two brothers it was about living according to the tenets of islam and showing respect to women by indicating that the very touch of female fingers is abhorrent yeah right but little toe-rag s big brother is quick to play the infantile islamophobia card he spoke of more sinister forces at work politicians are using us to stir up anti-muslim feeling. get real brat displays of offensive arrogance are what s likely to stir up anti-muslim feeling this incredible notion that the swiss should put up with backward alien behaviour or be branded unreasonable when they object to ungrateful tykes who insult the women of their host nation switzerland is european not arab the brats live in switzerland not syria big toe-rag vaguely grasps the need to pretend to accept this reality we respect swiss culture and of course we obey the laws of this country we try as much as possible to integrate yet in the same breath he flaunts what s so deeply wrong we have our own culture we can t just delete that like a hard drive the 16-year-old said get real your hard-drives are unwelcome delete them or sod off back to the middle east where women are too often accorded by shariah law second-class status or find some other country you ll be at ease in that sees nothing wrong with deeming women untouchable with discriminatory inheritance law with polygamy with shrouding women s heads but not men s. it turns out that this brat s kid brother yearns for the good ole homeland s ince the scandal erupted it has emerged that his younger brother posted isis videos on his facebook page i was 12 years old and didn t even know what isis was it was just about the music i liked it he said yeah right -============ that easy listening jihad-jazz on a summer s day keeping time to the sound of decapitated bodies dropping to the ground a neat background rhythm of sobbing rape victims of course thescum know what isis is and isis does the satanic nature of the rape/murder gang is infamous around the world no one can force us to touch someone s hand the brothers told sonntagszeitung saying that any attempt in that direction was a form of discrimination aaah discrimination now there s a word the insolent brat learned damn fast pity they can t learn to delete sex discrimination from their horrid hard drives tom thorham and penny are discussing toggle comments after reading about those adolescent rapist migrants i used to say the definition of a child should be under fourteen but this little sh-t watching isis videos at age 12 has made me revise my ideas downwards and yes that scottish tawse or a stout cane is exactly what these two horrors need like like and they want to bring more like them to england jesus save us like like but then we realise it s 14th february can i reach the garden gate though the stacks of mail ooops it s sunday no mailman..ooops again no letter-carrier and biggest ooops this is not after all valentine s day =============== tolak reject valentine s day boring hari menutup aurat international literal translation international day for covering aurat aurat a matter of interpretation but google translate often gives it as private parts yet what normal sane people regard as private parts has little to do with it though no regrets for the fun afforded me when i wrote about no guarantees on miss world s private parts mui another common google translate offering is genitals most of us would be taken aback if genitalia were on display but that s uncommon to say the least except in the smallest minds to be found in the archipelago genitals scholars on scarfs – must be shariah-compliant hide genitals show no curves we can review what s a private part in a moment but first let me remind you aurat is a sexist concept a form of subjugation imposed by men usually old but often younger fogeys too the poster below which needs to be widely circulated makes the sexism absolutely clear 000000000 addressed to ayah dan suami fathers and husbands you can see what s forbidden in the lists on either side of michelin maid then at the bottom it offensively tells the afore-mentioned gents that their aurat is your responsibility in other words inspect your women before you allow them out but you men can go bare-headed flaunt your kees etc instead of using the word to describe what you and i might consider private parts jihadist jackasses have hi-jacked it to cover splendid or even meagre cleavage thighs mid-riffs they hate navels and even knees good indonesians denounce archbigot ali s latest intolerant outburst and shoulders beautiful glossy black hair too is deemed aurat by the fanatic fringe which is really saaaad this mentality always provokes me but only to do something nice for readers like find good yummy females with loads of aurat for your delectation basically the fanatic fogeys dislike women we like em so here you are welcome to beautiful indonesia have a happy darryl is discussing toggle comments wonderful pix ross thanks for making the morning brighter and a good article this aurat is a crock let women be women the way god made them like like some poor frenchwoman naively thought she could safely use public transport in the capital city of her own country only to be near-strangled and indecently assaulted and it would have been worse had not a courageous citizen boarded the train and scared them off http //www.thelocal.fr/20160107/two-jailed-after-attempted-gang-rape-on-paris-train them go on take a wild guess around ten men reported to be afghan refugees thanks to cctv and to major dissimilarities between honest french cops and the gutless pc renegades who police sweden peter ågren police chief in central stockholm- sometimes we do not dare to say how things really are because we believe it will play into the hands of the sweden democrats. as we now know police officers in stockholm are instructed not to reveal the ethnicity or nationality of any suspects lest they be accused of racism it s not only germany that covers up mass sex attacks two of the filthy pigs were subsequently arrested and identified by the victim has nobody suggested castration for rapefugees yet indian women talk sense apart from being a punishment to fit the crime it would also have the spin-off benefit that these swine would not reproduce more brats to grow up in their vile ideology which endorses subjugation of women ross1948 and joseph b fox are discussing toggle comments bit of a tautology in your headline like like hence the quotation marks my friend i try to avoid messing about with other people s words except when non-english-speakers send in comments when i will carry out a quick grammar job like like ludicrous the backward element shrilling about the law being discriminative when polygamy itself represents the vilest discriminatory affront to equity giving men ample options to assuage their carnal needs but without corresponding privileges for women if i remember right from my modern history books it was meant to be a major reformist move but such was the rage among sectarian bigots that it was watered down muslim criticism was directed at the bill s restrictions on polygamy and acceptance of interreligious mixed marriages. 9 there were heated debates on the bill in the people s representative assembly as well as protests by muslim students 10 even suharto s iron regime quailed before islamist intolerance as a result of the strong opposition and potential for serious unrest an amended statute was enacted on january 2 1974 that permitted polygamous marriage and excluded the provision that would have specifically allowed inter-religious marriages 11 http //www.loc.gov/law/help/religious-marriage.php so a golden opportunity to reinforce indonesia s position as a modern democratic nation was missed because of a pack of rowdy student louts presumably barely educated pesantren primitives and their equally intolerant elders however fast forward oh yeah fakhrul who claimed to have two wives said islamic teachings allowed muslims to practice poly gamy so indonesia is not an islamic republic but a pluralist democracy so unless and until the entire archipelago follows the primitive province of aceh and adopts shariah law propriety will prevail more or less the marriage law upholds the principle of monogamy but allows husbands to have multiple wives under certain conditions including that of being married to a woman who is suffering from a serious illness and unable to bear a child aha what about a woman married to a man with a serious illness or to a man who s sterile and unable to give her a child women like that should surely equally enjoy the right to an extra husband or two if they can stand the idea time for the un or some other body of sticky-beaks to come in and tell jakarta to shape up actually that should not need to happen there are a lot of intelligent indonesians who use their brains rather than stifle them with archaic dogma t he national commission on violence against women komnas perempuan has urged the government to speed up an amendment to the marriage law to strengthen principles of monogamy it recorded more than 70 polygamy cases involving public officials that ended up as sexual abuse cases in 2015 but it will be an uphill struggle we reported on the bizarre sexist circular from the defense ministry last year and there are numerous polygamists in high places the report names several including bin laden fan anis matta https //rossrightangle.wordpress.com/2013/02/02/bin-laden-fan-takes-over-mb-clones-mired-in-bribe-row/ ======= you d think with friends like matta polygamy would be even more abhorrent to normal folk but indonesia is a very unusual place http //www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/01/03/polygamists-file-judicial-review-marriage-law.html when i first saw this photo on wnd i thought it had been taken in indonesia the uptight white-robed geezers displaying that tiresome indignation we see on the faces of sexist fanatics here you know the sort of crack-pots who think that a bare shoulder or knee is akin to being bugil naked or that women should go about resembling sacks of potatoes and that fathers and husbands should coerce them into such outfits sexist shariah anti-women poster- fathers and husbands their naughty bits are your responsibility .. regardless of any inclinations the women themselves might have to dress and behave like normal girls but no it happened near paris and shows a lass from the frantic feminist group called femen she boldly gate-crashed a conclave of kill-joys whose respect for womanhood the threadbare lie they deploy to justify shrouding women under their control was exposed as a sexist sham by the vile abuse and threats as the femen fillies there were two of them were kicked by jhadist cowards during their ejection ======================== read the whole story here http //www.wnd.com/2015/09/topless-women-pummeled-by-muslim-men/ ho-hum mind you i ve got a rather un-busy weekend coming up and some people have called my blog sexist if i report myself to femen hq do you think they might send a coupla gals round here to stage a similar demo i ll lay in some extra beers just in case a young woman has been barred by some bone-head security goon in kl from entering a hospital because her shorts did not extend below knee-level ================= on monday two women a journalist and selangor resident were forced to wear sarongs to enter the selangor state secretariat building in another incident on june 8 a woman was denied entry into the gombak road transport department jpj office for wearing a skirt above her knee and was asked to wear a sarong for service http //w3w.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/06/23/third-sarong-incident-malaysia-woman-wearing-shorts-barred- entering-hospital.html this offensive aurat drivel has erupted only a week after that lovely malaysian athlete was denounced by dark agers for dressing sensibly and attractively whilst competing in her sport what s wrong with knees or thighs for that matter i went over to a jakarta mall yesterday and was agreeably distracted from my coffee and the book i was browsing by the passing displays of both i ve been to kl and saw much the same there in both cities there are plenty of healthy normal people but alas plenty of narrow minds too who think their uptight prejudices give them the right to decree dress codes ============== scholars on scarfs – must be shariah-compliant hide genitals show no curves malaysia is speeding up its descent into the swamp envisioned by that most intolerant indonesian politican suryadharma ali who declared whilst holding office as minister of religious affairs in the sby government that hiding knees was a universal criterion which must be observed by all all no the message is aimed only at women nice knees nobody is likely to complain if i walk down to the indomaret to replenish my cigarette supply wearing shorts well some might but only on aesthetic grounds my knees being less than glorious to look at unlike those above or these below – imagine you re convalescing in hospital and she came by to visit miracle cure – too many benighted brutes are telling us that women are second-class citizens that men make the rules == == that infamous aurat warning makes it clear beyond doubt that it s men s job duty even to tell women what to wear and to make them as unattractive as possible pathetic if you don t like the sight of a pretty woman don t ogle but let the rest of us enjoy what is inherently enjoyable jack again and santi are discussing toggle comments if we go out of our house without clothes it is expected we shock and anger people but in a short dress what is the big problem if we go to office with bikini also shock but nobody will do that these fanatic men like fpi and hizbut hate women so much i am very much surprise they have children ross i think you miss the intolerant minister not so much to write about but it is good we do not have suryadharma ali anymore in our government always he makes me embarassed to be indonesian like like that poster you show us says it all the morons do treat women like chattels husbands and fathers telling them what to wear i m a father and i stopped doing that when mine were old enough to vote and in most normal countries it s usually the wife who says you can t go to the shops looking like that bu tit s no joke really because lots of these morons are emigrating to countries where women have rights and the morons think they can bring their moron im morals along with them if they would join the rest of us in the twentyfirst century or anywhere after the middle ages there would be fewer objections to them joining us in europe but as things stand the men are basicially subhuman and their women hopeless wimps for putting up with it like like two different petitions are out there to deal with her hate-mongering you can sign this one for the worldwide public through this link 00000000000000 the bigoted bint who inexplicably holds the position of welfare and diversity officer hit the headlines after endorsing overt sexist and racist discrimination at a goldsmith s university event in london http //blogs.spectator.co.uk/lara-prendergast/2015/04/white-people-have-now-been-banned-from-an-anti-racism-event-at-a-british-university/ since then further revelations about her hate hashtags have stoked the wrath of decent students who want her ousted from her student union job they have a separate petition which reads the current welfare and diversity officer has used hate speech based on race and gender the union petition for example the consistent use of hashtags such as killallwhitemen and misandry and publicly calling someone white trash under the official gsu welfare and diversity officer twitter account bahar s racist spleen is something she ought not to broadcast especially in murderous terminology to read what she says and sadly probably really thinks is to get the impression she is suffering from acute mental illness i an ethnic minority woman can not be racist or sexist towards white men because racism and sexism describe structures of privilege based on race and gender and therefore women of colour and minority genders can not be racist or sexist since we do not stand to benefit from such a system 000 000 we will not be silenced we are militant the world is not ready for minorities to challenge the status quo but resistance to our resistance is futile she added and she thinks the slogan kill all white men is an in-joke exclusive to people in the queer feminist community it s a way of reclaiming the power from the trauma many of us experience as queers women people of colour who are on the receiving end of racism misogyny and homophobia daily she added http //www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/bahar-mustafa-goldsmiths-university-diversity-officer-could-lose-job-after-being-accused-by-students-of-racism-against-white-men-10260697.html 00 00 help give her time for therapy -sign the petition at the top of our page enrique is discussing toggle comments my god but is she completely crazy talking like she is above debate or criticism psycho like like boom the guardian and the independent and the mirror would have gone totally nuts as would the daily mail had the winning coloured female been a tory and understandably the colour and the sex of a candidate should make no difference if he or she is a patriotic brit loyal to queen and country now zoom in on plymouth where a sore loser named singh has erupted in the most basic racist and sexist language against not just the chap who won tons more votes than he did but also against the choice of the two other constituencies in that quintessentially english city the problem is our parliamentary system doesn t reflect the society we live in the dimwit clearly still thinks in terms of the communalism once and perhaps still rampant in the indan sub-continent whence he or his family originated the society brits live in is one where people choose their mps on the basis of their character and/or their brains not their complexion or their genitals in western democracies of course it s expected and usually is the case that voters look at what a parliamentary candidate has to say about what matters to them sane voters don t get fretty if that candidate doesn t physically resemble them only morons would worry about that it s issues maybe the nhs immigration devolution the eussr etc not ethnicity or age or weight or hair-colour or left- or right-handedness or whether or not the candidate uses the toilet standing up or sitting down ============================ and most certainly not on blatant racist or sexist grounds they are all what i call mps – male pale and stale. ======= ========= mr singh also bemoaned the lack of sikh mps in the house of commons but says he has learned a lot from his experience http //www.plymouthherald.co.uk/election-2015-defeated-labour-candidate-bemoans/story-26464621-detail/story.html obviously he still has a lot to learn about civilised politics changed days but labour party hq should understand the basics of civics in the uk they haven t fired the prejudiced fool and that s what s most telling http
