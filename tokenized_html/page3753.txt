a new look at the hydrogen wave function physics4me the first direct observation of the orbital structure of an excited hydrogen atom has been made by an international team of researchers the observation was made using a newly developed quantum microscope which uses photoionization microscopy to visualize the structure directly the team s demonstration proves that photoionization microscopy which was first proposed more than 30 years ago can be experimentally realized and can serve as a tool to explore the subtleties of quantum mechanics read more at physicsworld.com and physics.aps.org higgs boson one page explanation in high energy physics physics nobel goes to serge haroche and david wineland in quantum physics physicists aim to make transition to quantum world visible in quantum physics your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name email website notify me of new comments via email notify me of new posts via email this site uses akismet to reduce spam learn how your comment data is processed
