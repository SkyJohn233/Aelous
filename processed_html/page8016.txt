Did the English people back in the 1400s have swear words that they used in speech? : AskHistorians I was watching Game of Thrones and noticed that they dropped the f-bomb a lot and I was wondering if the people of 1400s used the same or different words than the ones we use currently There are a lot of  &# x27;naughty &# x27; words in Chaucher, shit, piss, pussy (in the vagina sense), prick (penis or sexual intercourse) etc. but it &# x27;s debatable how offensive they were considered at the time. On the one hand Chaucher writes disclaimers about using profane language for characterisation, but on the other hand  &# x27;mild &# x27; swear words like  &# x27;piss &# x27; appear in the Wycliffe bible around the same time so can &# x27;t have been that shocking. When he &# x27;s using mimicking the speech of ordinary people in his prose Chaucher uses what people today may well consider swear words so we can gauge from that evidence that people did use these terms , but in an age before plumbing where people defecated out of windows on to the street could a word like  &# x27;arse &# x27; have been the least bit shocking? Much more likely to shock would be blasphemous swear-words (the original meaning of  &# x27;swear word &# x27; referred to this as to say an oath is to  &# x27;swear &# x27; and invoking God &# x27;s name was considered to be part of an oath) In Canterbury tales Chaucher does NOT use blasphemous language freely like he does with scatological words, indeed he refers to it at a remove, condemning it in his text: ‘Thou blasphemour of Cryst with vileinye... &# x27; ‘.. many a grisly ooth thanne han they sworn, And Crystes blessed body they to-rente;’ Fuck BTW isn &# x27;t attested until the 16th c. in writing - but if it was very taboo it mayn &# x27;t have been written on any documents that survived until long after it became current. The first use of fuck is a bit of a cop out because it &# x27;s cod-latin Non sunt in celi quia fuccant uuiuys of heli Where fuccant = fuck " They [the monks] are not in heaven because they fuck the wives of [the town of] Ely. " There are multiple prior routes to get  &# x27;fuck &# x27; in to English before this as there are related words in Scandinavian languages and middle English. Judging my Chaucher - chosen because he &# x27;s the Shakespeare of this era - he writes for and about a range of social classes - scatological  &# x27;dirty &# x27; swear-words were not very shocking, but religious ones were. PS I have modernised all spellings in non-quoted text for the sake of clarity. I have never seen Chaucer spelt  " Chaucher. "  Is there a reason for that? You take Chaucer as representative of English commoners, but both of your quotes come from the Pardoner &# x27;s Tale, which adds another degree of separation.  As a thoroughly hypocritical churchman, the Pardoner would pay lip-service to condemning blasphemy.  We &# x27;d need to see numerous examples of this blasphemy-at-a-remove, through other  characters, before concluding that Chaucer himself treats blasphemy that way. I &# x27;d check the Miller and Reeve for blasphemous oaths.  I &# x27;d honestly be surprised if there were none. To OP &# x27;s question, I know the Wife of Bath says that one of her husbands told her she had  " the prettiest cunt "  (Middle English:  " queynte " ) he &# x27;d ever seen, and she promises one of the old husbands that he &# x27;ll have  " cunt enough "  at night time. By  &# x27;cod-latin &# x27;, do you mean fuck was a loan word of sorts? I ask because I thought fuck had Anglo-Saxon origins. pussy (in the vagina sense) prick (penis or sexual intercourse) I doubt these are true given that the  OED &# x27;s first citations for both senses is well after Chaucer &# x27;s death. I know this question is specifically about English people, but the Wu Ming Foundation (an anarchist collective then known as Luther Blisset) wrote  a wonderful little essay  on the history of swears in Romance languages, in response to the allegedly anachronistic language in their novel  Q  (which remains one of my all-time favorite pieces of historical fiction). To elaborate on the idea of blasphemy, this was considered a violation of the Second Commandment and considered a serious offense.  A manual intended to aid priests in administering confession that Bishop Walter Cantilupe issued for the diocese of Exeter in 1240 elaborated on its gravity:  " Furthermore, he should see whether he has perjured God &# x27;s name, especially while looking at or touching holy objects [i.e., the equivalent of our swearing on a bible], which often happens at courts of assizes; in this regard teach them about the evils of perjury.  Or whether he has sworn oaths without reason, especially by swearing on the head or limbs of Christ, which people do from habit ignoring the wisdom of Solomon who said  &# x27;Let not thy mouth be accustomed to swearing, &# x27; etc. [Ecclus 23:9]. " Swearing by God &# x27;s Blood or God &# x27;s Wounds--the latter eumphemized by the 16th century into  " zounds " --was apparently popular.  I &# x27;ve seen a source--15th-century English as I recall, but I can &# x27;t place my fingers on at the moment--that mentions that when people swear on God &# x27;s/Christ &# x27;s head, body, limbs, wounds, etc., they are in fact subjecting to the torments of his Passion again.  Swearing by the devil also occurred:  " Devil take you, "  that sort of thing, very much like our  " God damn you. " The punishments for blasphemy could be severe, as we learn from the biography of the pious King Louis IX of France (later sainted and after whom St. Louis, MO is named) written in the early 1300s by his friend Jean de Joinville: " The king loved God and his sweet Mother so well that if anybody within his reach used any foul language or lewd oath about God or his mother, the king had them very severely punished.  Thus I saw him have a goldsmith at Cesarea put on a ladder in his shirt and breeches, with the entrails of a pig hung round his neck, right up to his ears.  I heard it said after I returned from overseas that he had a burgher of Paris seared through the nose and lips for the same offence, but I did not see it.  The holy king said, “I would gladly be branded with a hot iron, providing that all lewd oaths were done away with in my kingdom.”  I was about twenty two years in his company; and never heard him swear by God, nor by his mother nor by his saints; but whenever he wanted to affirm anything, he used to say, “Truly it was thus,” or “Truly it shall be thus.” I never heard him use the Devil’s name, unless it was in some book where the name was mentioned, or in the life of the saint of whom the book was speaking.  And a great disgrace it is to the realm of France, and to the king who allows it, that a man can hardly open his lips without saying “Devil take it!”  It is a great abuse of language to consign to the devil a man or woman who was given to God at baptism.  In the household of Joinville, whoever uses such an expression pays for it with a buffet or a slap, and such bad language has been almost entirely put down. . . . " I &# x27;m sure that there were, but really don &# x27;t know about the 1400s.  If you go slightly later though, there are lots of great insults in Shakespeare (c. 1600).  One of my favorites is Zounds, which to us sounds silly but was incredibly offensive at the time: it is a contraction of  " His wounds "  and refers to Christ on the cross.  Heavy stuff. There are many many more great Shakespearian insults and curses, they &# x27;re beautiful. Careful though. This: It is thought to be an Acronym for Fornication Under Consent of King. This acronym was placed on placards to be posted on doors of couples who had permission from the King to have sex. Is known to be  untrue , which kind of puts the whole blog entry under suspicion. 1.1m Readers 1.3k Readers Online Aug 28, 2011 Cake Day
