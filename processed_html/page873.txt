bttv emote box doesn &# x27;t have any emotes in the favorite emotes section. : Twitch I &# x27;ve been using bttv for a while and I like the emote box. Any body else have a problem where they don &# x27;t have any emotes in the favorite emotes section I &# x27;m not at my pc atm but isn &# x27;t that the section where you have to add your favorite emotes by hitting the edit button at the bottom? There’s a guy who almost always watches my streams. Some days he lurks, some days he chats, but he’s always so nice and supportive and he actually thinks my stream is fun. I honestly look forward to streaming, at this point, for him. Tonight he asked if I’d be on tomorrow and I said yeah and he said “love watching your stream lol it’s fun :D”. It was so satisfying to read! So wanted to share the love ❤️ edit typo First time I saw it, it was whatever. Now I get that shit everytime I open someone &# x27;s streams. the fucking  aRe yOu kIDdINg mE RigHT nOW That overdramatic screech that rips through my ear drums. The  tHanK you CoKE! Yesterday I was streaming some CS:GO and after I was a bit over 2 hours in I randomly look over at my second monitor and I had like 500 viewers. I immediately like any normal person checked my notifications to see if I missed a huge raid or host and nothing was there. I then assumed it was a glitch on my end and it would go away. Then after 10-15 more minutes it still was fluctuating between 400-700 viewers I check on the actual twitch site and there I am with 500 viewers and on the top like 10 CS streams at the time. I continued to stream for the next like 3 hours and maintained 400-700 viewers the entirety of the time. My average for the past 30 days went from 4 to 40. One of the weirdest things about this was I had 1 new follower and no new people talk  in chat besides my friends and my regulars which is actually kind of slow compared to the norm. I want answers!! Im so confused !! Just to pre empt what I’m going to say I’m not talking about subscriptions. Recently with all the news of the big streamers signing contracts, making big money (which is awesome, get that bread!!) I started thinking about donations. I’m not here to tell anybody how to spend their own money but just an idea, maybe every so often instead of donating to the people making tens of thousands a month, maybe pop by a smaller streamer that you enjoy and send the dono their way. I’m not saying stop donating to the big dogs I’m just saying every so often it would be nice to make a difference to someone who might actually need the money! I don’t think a few less donations to the big streamers will hurt their pockets as I imagine most of their income is based off subs, brand deals, streaming contracts etc. As I say just a thought at this time of year where money unfortunately is an issue for a lot of people! I create graphics and motion design for content creators. I released a free download of my Snow FX made in After Effects on my Instagram and thought this would be a good place to share and get streams into a holiday mood. It &# x27;s very simple, soft white snow that slowly drifts down the screen seamlessly. It &# x27;s transparent, add it as a media source in OBS or SLOBS and set to loop. You can of course resize it to your liking and change the opacity etc using a Color Correction filter. 1080p / 60FPS / webm Download:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/13BRB0aA3il6IW6DLkh0ljHVOZ9cBKNIj/view?usp=sharing I &# x27;m fine with ads. I &# x27;m fine with disabling ad blocker. I &# x27;m fine with supporting the streams. But eventually I need to be able to get to the content... I am not the kind of person who watches the same stream for hours on end. I probably follow ~100 channels, and at night will spend around an hour hopping from channel to channel the whole time checking in on creators I enjoy. I used to get a forced ad for the first stream I turned on, then I could pop around. Now I get the 60 seconds  " oh my god coke wtf!!??! "  ad for every. single. channel. I can &# x27;t just pop around so I &# x27;m forced to open like 15 tabs to do them all at once and then pause or mute them. Just me? I &# x27;m watching Capcom Cup just now, and I &# x27;ve set my resolution to 1080p (Source), but for some reason, it keeps on scaling down to 480p without me touching anything. I have to set it back to 1080p (Source), but later on, it goes back to 480p. It &# x27;s very annoying and irritating. How do I prevent that from happening? I &# x27;ve been getting a few kids on my channel during the last couple of weeks. They seem to enjoy my stream and have become regulars. I don &# x27;t curse a lot or talk about 18+ stuff much except from a few comments here and there. Sometimes I play games that aren &# x27;t really suitable for kids, but they watch anyway. I even give warnings about the games before I play them. However, another fellow streamer told me I should ban all underage viewers if I have the maturity setting switched on, which I do. According to him, it &# x27;s a violation of the TOS. >< p> Mind you, I know their age because they freely told me. I never ask any personal questions to viewers beyond  " How &# x27;s your day going "  and some other banal stuff. People share what they want and I try to keep the conversation alive. >< p> Is it true that what I &# x27;m doing is against TOS? I &# x27;ve tried to find that section but couldn &# x27;t figure it out. Thanks in advance. >< p> Edit: They are older than 13, just wanted to clarify that. Title is pretty much explanatory. I ' m getting this problem across multiple browsers and no amount of clearing caches or cookies has helped. I have a lot of cool ideas for channel points, but features like the wiggling active viewer bonus chest are a no go for me. I really don ' t want my regulars to feel like they need to be clicking that to stay competitive, and since I run reruns off-hours, someone could easily write a script to automatically click it when it pops up, 24/7. For clarity, here are the earn rates I ' m talking about: https://i.imgur.com/a7nHBZg.png The  " special bonus "  chest is pretty egregious -- a subscriber can earn 240 points per hour by watching, but clicking the chest every 15 minutes produces an  additional  400 points an hour. I ' d really like to be able to adjust the earn rates for points across the channel like I can do with any bot ' s loyalty currency. I browsed all around my dashboard and its still locked after the recent twitch update. Anything I need to do to unlock this feature now?
