bill stull the driving force behind 7-1 pitt panthers nesn university nesn.com pittsburgh senior quarterback bill stull entered the season with one year of starting experience that year was shall we say less than stellar last season stull completed only 57 percent of his passes throwing for 196 yards per game with a total of nine touchdowns and 10 interceptions with these numbers it s easy to see why not much was expected of stull this season in fact he was seen as a liability the offense was supposed to be nothing more than a bruising rushing attack but with new offensive coordinator frank cignetti jr. and the growth of stull as a quarterback the panthers now possess an offense that is formidable both through the air and on the ground in 2009 stull is completing 67 percent of his passes passing for 16 touchdowns and only four interceptions this past week against south florida stull looked like a leader directing pitt to scoring drives in each of the team s first five possessions stull has now risen to the ranks of one of the best players in the big east he is one of the main reasons why the panthers are 7-1 and ranked no 16 in the most recent ap poll no 5 cincinnati 7-0 3-0 big east 41 louisville 2-5 0-3 big east 10 sure louisville is a bad team but the bearcats need to beat everyone if they are to play for a national title this is the type of game in which good teams often do not bring their a-game on a day when no 1 florida had a close victory over a bad sec team mississippi state and no 6 iowa needed a last-second touchdown to beat an average big ten team michigan state cincinnati rolled cincinnati s starting quarterback tony pike was forced to sit this one out after undergoing surgery on his non-throwing hand this past week zach collaros started in his place and performed very well as the offense did not miss a beat no 20 pittsburgh 7-1 4-0 41 south florida 5-2 1-2 14 the game was just as lopsided as the final score would indicate pitt s offense was unstoppable scoring on all five first-half possessions there was nothing that didn t work for the panthers in this rout as they rushed for 214 yards and threw for another 272 after the win pitt has moved up to no 15 in the bcs standings for south florida it looks like business as usual after a fast start the bulls have not even been competitive against the big east s two best teams cincinnati and pittsburgh next up is west virginia south florida has given up 75 points over the past two weeks so the team has a lot of work to do to correct a defense that started the season very strongly no 23 west virginia 6-1 2-0 28 connecticut 4-3 1-2 24 this was an emotional game as uconn was still recovering the loss of teammate jasper howard the entire stadium at west virginia stood for a moment of silence before the game and west virginia players wore a no 6 sticker on their helmets in honor of howard the big east is a conference of only eight teams and howard s passing hit several players and teams very hard for the game connecticut certainly played inspired ball particularly quarterback cody endres who threw for a career-high 378 yards uconn racked up 501 yards of offense and led with less than four minutes to play but in the end it was turnovers that did the huskies in they turned the ball over four times in the second half and were unable to overcome this uconn has lost three games this season each of which they led in the fourth quarter west virginia meanwhile just continues to win they are now ranked no 20 in the ap poll and have a few weeks to get ready for cincinnati and pittsburgh these mountaineers may nor appear to be as good as either of the top two big east teams but they will have their chance to prove themselves rutgers 5-2 0-2 27 army 10 the scarlet knights beat a terrible army team by a relatively slim margin but a win is a win rutgers has no passing game to speak of and if it hopes to beat either louisville or syracuse it will need to find a way to convert through the air otherwise the scarlet knights could find themselves at the bottom of the big east standings syracuse 3-4 0-2 28 akron 14 on paper this game shaped up as a mismatch however on game day syracuse coach doug marrone announced that he had suspended star wide receiver mike williams for violating team rules it must have been something serious as williams is far and away the best player on the orange he is a superstar on a bad team without williams syracuse is a different team luckily the orange were playing a truly terrible akron team the orange held the zips to less than 200 yards of offense including zero on the ground meanwhile syracuse did its damage on the ground with delone carter rushing for a career-high 170 yards syracuse s next two games are against no 5 cincinnati and no 20 pittsburgh it could be a long two weeks for the orange what we learned 1 the big east is a tight-knit community every coach in the league contacted uconn to help provide support in the aftermath of jasper howard s untimely passing 2 uconn can play with anyone in the big east but they can t seem to beat the best teams 3 the big east is a three-team race as cincinnati pittsburgh and west virginia remain undefeated in conference play 4 right on cue south florida has fallen apart after a fast start respect barometer it is now certain that three of the big east s eight teams louisville rutgers and syracuse are bad however the other five teams are pretty good cincinnati pittsburgh and west virginia are all ranked in the top 20 in the ap poll this is big currently there is not a single conference that boasts more than three teams in the ap top 20 including the sec for comparison the pac-10 and big 12 each only have two teams ranked in the top 20 that doesn t necessarily mean the big east is seen in the same light as these other conferences but it does show that pollsters think just as highly of top big east teams as they do of teams from other conferences this is a modal window beginning of dialog window escape will cancel and close the window end of dialog window nhl s tim thomas opens up about brain damage i didn t talk to anybody tommy
