very fast interactive visualization of large sets of high-dimensional data sciencedirect sciencedirect the embedding of high-dimensional data into 2d/3d space is the most popular way of data visualization despite recent advances in developing of very accurate dimensionality reduction algorithms such as bh-sne q-sne and loch their relatively high computational complex- ity still remains the obstacle for interactive visualization of truly large datasets consisting of m 10 6+ of high-dimensional n 10 3+ feature vectors we show that a new clone of the multidimensional scaling mds – nr -mds–can be up to two orders of magnitude faster than the modern dimensionality reduction algorithms we postulate its linear o m computational and memory complexities simultaneously our method preserves in 2d/3d target spaces high separability of data similar to that obtained by the state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction algorithms we present the effects of nr -mds application in visualization of data repositories such as 20 newsgroups m 1 8 ·10 4 mnist m 7·10 4 and reuters m 2 67·10 5 selection and peer-review under responsibility of the scientific programme committee of iccs 2015 elsevier we use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads by continuing you agree to the use of cookies copyright © 2019 elsevier b.v. or its licensors or contributors sciencedirect ® is a registered trademark of elsevier b.v
