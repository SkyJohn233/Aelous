How to delete a DNS Zone with WMI - Stack Overflow                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 I can create a new zone, add and delete records for that zone, all relatively easily using WMI and System.Management, but for the life of me can't figure out how to delete a zone. It doesn't appear to be a method in the WMI Documentation: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682123(VS.85).aspx Any thoughts on how to do this? Trying to keep the DNS server clean when we remove old website customers, but I can only get as good as deleting all the records in a zone.  EDIT: This is on a windows server 2008 R2 machine. And I would be ok with an answer of "don't use WMI" if there is an alternate solution I can execute from a remote machine and code in c# You can delete zones in the same manner you would a record.
