It was a long, hard slog but I ' ve finally finished my daughters doll house.  # ProjectDollhouse pic.twitter.com/EEnVWYvEOT It ' s ok to treat me like shit because I ' m a white, English male and my ancestors had it good for too fucking long. Still at the playground. My daughter is flirting outrageously with a young boy... Who doesn ' t seem to have an owner... There were lots of long, lonely days when I lived in Chumphon. pic.twitter.com/bsrGKJpeSu The bear-wolf patrolling the field. pic.twitter.com/OAEbSAnmbE I ' m at the park with the other dog, and a fucking gigantic wolf-bear has taken a liking to her. pic.twitter.com/qW8GoC3t0g Really? Because I have it in my hand right now. pic.twitter.com/HiF0yTqBb7 Dave Chappelle in Bangkok. Is he funny though? Shady, outside with food, drink and toilets available nearby. Quite nice just hanging out at Mega Bang Na. McPicnic pic.twitter.com/SE4ftNZauk Mega Quiet at Mega Bang Na. pic.twitter.com/EkGxwBoVqw Off to Mega Bang Na to finish my Xmas shopping. Flipping between Pantera and Sublime this morning. A bit unhinged. Making a deliberate effort to use more plastic in the hope that the world will end soon. Sitting on the floor of a train is actually more comfortable and convenient than sitting in a shitty, cramped seat. I ' m a bit like Marmite, except everyone hates me. Excuse me while I slip back into my childhood. pic.twitter.com/vh8b5dcUVp Goodbye cruel world. # OpeningACan pic.twitter.com/SaKGTFzC0v           @bkksomchai hasn ' t Tweeted yet.
