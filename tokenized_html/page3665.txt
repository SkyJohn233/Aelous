meet our plus size fit model sarah from print and petal your go-to for all things fashion home and lifestyle related sarah has many talents she is a fit model for ezibuy s plus size range fashion model for 62 models and business owner for print and petal she s pretty inspiring so we wanted to know a little bit more about her what do you do at ezibuy i m a fit model for ezibuy this means that my measurements are used to make sure that all the garments that come in are fitting at a consistent size so all the size 16 s will be size 16 s because they are measured against the same constant. p how did you get into modelling in 2015 last year i was scouted while i was working in the city a lady came up to me and explained that there was a photo shoot coming up that they needed a model for and asked if i would be interested i was really taken aback but i said yes from there i was signed to 62 models it was such a good choice because despite the nerves and initial self doubt it s such an empowering career. p what s the best job that you ve done so far surprisingly my last runway was probably my favourite i got to meet and mingle with some really amazing women who were walking for the same brand the energy of the day was great i had been so nervous beforehand though fashion shows terrify me because of the behind the scenes side of things the walks themselves are fantastic but needing to change outfits within 10 seconds is so stressful the pressure is incredible it s the kind of thing that seems like the world depends on it in the moment and then it s done and you can take a step back and laugh at how intense the situation is. p how do you feel about being defined as a plus size model strong it s a term that has really established itself in the industry as a legitimate category of modeling so i find it really empowering when i started i felt like being a plus size model made me less of a model than standard sized chicks i think this was more to do with how i was treated as a plus size girl throughout most of my life after becoming a model people started wanting to celebrate my body and imperfections so being a plus size model has always been a great thing it was simply my insecurities that had me looking at myself sideways i m so proud of my position as a plus size model now younger me would be speechless curve model is a term that i would like to see more normalized as well plus does tend to imply that it s extra whereas i see us as not just larger than the size 6 s but different entirely our bodies are incomparable clothes fit different look different feel different on curvier girls so the term used to describe us could better reflect that at the end of the day it s just a nickname we re all just playing dress up and posing for the camera do you have any advice for aspiring models just use every available platform for self-promotion whether that s twitter facebook instagram just remember to promote yourself true to who you are and the kind of model you d like to be take all opportunities check out application processes on agency websites the best things you can do are just to research your available resources and work your butt off. p what do you do in your spare time in my spare time if i ever get any i like to write and make things for my small business a href= http /www.printandpetal.co.nz/ print and petal flower crowns illustrations it s all fun of course a glass of ros√© with friends is always a perk to empty afternoons my business is based mostly on wedding and event florals but when i don t have any on i try to further develop my giftware line which is mostly flower crowns illustrations and other really unique floral goodies i dream of a day where i can just mull about the house cleaning decorating making things and trying on new outfits in between running my business and modeling it s hard to find time to do the little things how did you start your floral business i ve always loved flowers one of my sisters and i used to talk about owning our own flower shop later in life for some bizarre reason i never thought of being a florist as a life-long career my goal had always been teaching after studying and quitting secondary education i felt stuck eventually i figured that i might as well see if i was any good at floristry i fell in love instantly it was like i suddenly realized what i was born to do my fine arts degree could actually be applied to something i was stoked. p i never thought i wanted to be self-employed though because i ve never had a good mind for accounting after working for a really talented florist for a while i started to crave the creative freedom that only being my own boss would allow it s really difficult to just do as you re told in creative industries when you want to be the one making the calls on styling my best friend since year nine at onehunga high school was actually the one to give me a push we started the business together but typically life got in the way and she was given some amazing opportunities elsewhere it was a bit strange being on my own to do this but it worked out best for everyone she was so supportive and really helped me spend the first year of business developing the brand my partner has also always been very supportive he is my absolute hero i honestly don t know how people do this kind of thing alone because without the love of my friends and family i wouldn t be able to do what i love what s your main go-to flower and why it really depends my go to flower changes depending on what s in season at the moment we re in peony season so they are just taking over my life not that i m complaining i m so obsessed with them there s something about peonies that just makes everyone fall head over heels the fact that they are only around for a little while makes them extra special other go-to s of mine include a colombian rose called quicksand and white stock they re really on trend and effortlessly beautiful. p where can people learn more about print and petal you can follow my day to day fun on my instagram a href= /www.instagram.com/printandpetal_/ printandpetal_ and facebook print and petal
