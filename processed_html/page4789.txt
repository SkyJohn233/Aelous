Mama June Is Going Blind (and Gaining Weight) Due to Cataracts Prevention may earn money from the links on this page. Why trust us? Untreated childhood cataracts have left her fighting for her ability to see. Following her dramatic weight loss transformation, Mama June Shannon says she's gained 25 pounds due to going completely blind in her right eye.  The 38-year-old  From Not to Hot  star  dropped 300 pounds  last year after a series of surgeries and strict lifestyle changes, but the weight began to creep back on as she underwent four more surgeries to repair what little vision she still has in her left eye, which she described to  People  as a "four out of 10." It s been physically and emotionally draining,  Shannon told  People .  Losing my independence and having to rely on other people for everything has been crazy. Her vision loss largely stems from childhood cataracts that were never properly treated, she explained. Her left eye was also damaged by retinal detachment, where the retina a light-sensitive layer of tissue that lines the eye and sends messages to the brain is separated from its normal position, according to the  National Eye Institute . Retinal detachment can also cause permanent vision loss. Shannon said she's still healing and dealing with shooting pain, so her weight loss isn't her main priority right now. "I can't do anything and have to lay down most of the time and take care of my vision," she said. "I have to worry about that right now. That's my main concern." "I can lose the weight; I know that. And I know I don t want to go back over 200 pounds. I m paying attention to it more," she added. Many people think of  cataracts  as something that happens only to older adults, but as Shannon's story unfortunately shows, the vision problem can start developing during middle age and even childhood, which leaves the potential for serious long-term effects.  So what exactly are cataracts? Technically, a cataract is a clouding  inside  the eye's lens (not on top of the lens, as many assume). The distortion begins to form when proteins in the lens break down. Usually, cataracts are related to age, but other factors can put you at risk for them as well, such as radiation, sun exposure, eye injury, or surgery for another eye issue, like glaucoma. People often develop them in both eyes, but it's possible for a cataract to form in just one eye, especially if you've had an injury there. More than half of all American who reach age 80 will develop cataracts, and cataract surgery is one of the safest and most common surgical procedures performed in the U.S. It's also the only effective way to remove a cataract but not everyone needs it.  "Many people put off surgery for years," Stephen Foster, MD, a clinical professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, told Prevention in a  previous interview . "I always say that if a cataract affects your quality of life, then we need to make plans to take it out. Otherwise, we can forget about it until your next appointment." The symptoms of early cataract may be improved with new glasses, brighter lighting, anti-glare sunglasses, or magnifying glasses, according to the NEI. If cataracts aren't having an adverse effect on everyday activities like driving or watching TV, then you're probably fine. However, be sure to talk with your doctor about the best course of action for you. As we all know, there's no stopping or slowing down the clock, and most people will experience some clouding that affects their vision by age 60. But there are things you can do to reduce your risk for cataracts. The best strategy is to wear UV-blocking sunglasses to protect your eyes. Other best practices include eating plenty of antioxidant-rich fruits and veggies, limiting alcohol, and taking steps to prevent developing  diabetes , which can put you at higher risk.
