Andrew Whiteside - Executive Sous Chef - Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts | LinkedIn I am a driven and passionate Chef that was drawn into the kitchens as a young boy. I used to run home after school each day to watch Pasquale "the singing italian chef" on TV. His italian philosophy of using the best and freshest product resonated with me early, it never let go. 10 years later I had the opportunity to meet my childhood hero! I've been blessed to have my culinary career take me to 3 different countries from pink sand beaches to snow capped rocky mountains.  Settling in at the Fairmont Olympic in Seattle has given me the opportunity to inspire, support and grow the next wave of culinarians. Just blocks away from local farmers and artisans at the Pike Place market. We are lucky enough to have a rooftop apiary which is home to our own Culinary Garden and Honey bees which provides us 600+ lbs of organic honey.
