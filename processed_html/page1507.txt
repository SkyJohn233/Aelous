On a valedictory boat tour of Rookery Bay, Ted Below talks about the importance of rookery islands like the one behind him.

The longtime researcher into the area’s birdlife was honored last week for a lifetime of work in helping to preserve our natural environment and the birds with which we share it, and had plenty to say about birds, people and a variety of other subjects. An official Collier County proclamation designated Dec. 9 as “Ted Below Day,” and that afternoon, a plaque with his picture and a thumbnail description of his long service as a naturalist was unveiled during a ceremony in the Environmental Learning Center at the Rookery Bay Research Reserve.

Below was also joined by Virginia or Ginny Below, his wife of many years, and his granddaughter Sherrie McCandless, an Air Force general and former F-16 pilot. Before the presentation, Below and his guests took a boat excursion through Rookery Bay to view some of the critical wildlife habitat that has been protected through his efforts. The day was chilly and cloudy, with a brisk wind creating whitecaps on the water’s surface in the protected and normally placid bay, but Below has been out in all kinds of weather, and although he walks with a cane, had no problem handling a little cool breeze. He spoke of the need for ongoing efforts to maintain a natural balance in the area’s ecosystem, but when it came to his own efforts, let others do the talking. And they had a lot to say. Speaking of Below’s impact on bird preservation in Southwest Florida, the word that came up again and again was “legend” – along with “outspoken,” “ornery” and “stubborn.” “Ted is a living legend. A big reason this area is under protection is due to Ted’s efforts,” said Laakkonen. “A lot of what we know about wading birds in Florida is thanks to Ted Below,” said Draper. Below accomplished the work that led to being honored through decades of dogged fieldwork, observing birds, tabulating his findings, formulating theories and presenting his conclusions through a long string of research projects, presentations and articles in ornithological publications going back to 1972 and still continuing today. And he did it without any formal scientific education; the schooling listed on his curriculum vitae is an associate degree from Edison Community College, and a bird seminar at Cornell. He has taught classes in bird watching and bird photography, lectured to school, governmental, conservation and service organizations, and given presentations at ornithology symposia all over the country. In the course of his work, Below calculates that he conducted 3,963 bird censuses, put in 13,588 hours of field work, and traveled 117,941 miles in a 16-foot boat, the equivalent of approximately five trips around the world, and went through five outboard engines. He was responsible for Critical Wildlife Area, or CWA, designations for the protection of the ABC Islands in the Marco River, Big Marco Pass CWA and Caxambas Pass CWA, and Second Chance Island south of Cape Romano.

Like the others, the governmental decisions leaned substantially on data collected and analyzed by Below. In a mellow mood on this day he was being lauded and honored, Below was not in a mood to pick fights with anyone, although he did speak bitterly against the voracious predation of raccoons in bird rookeries, when they get the chance. “Raccoons kill just to kill, not for food,” he said. “I’ve seen pelican rookeries where they wiped out 30 nests,” and left chicks and eggs to rot. The researcher in him kicked in, and he noted that while the birds who were alive at the time of that incident are long gone, brown pelicans still will not sit on that island, raising questions of how memories are passed on by avian species. And Below said that, long term, he fears for the survival of Southwest Florida’s bird population, caught up in an existential battle against human development they are doomed to lose. Below has garnered many awards in his long career. He was Wildlife Conservationist of the Year in 2006, given NOAA’s national Environmental Hero Award in 2001, recognized as a Star of the Environment by the Audubon Society in 2002, and given a Lifetime Achievement Award by Audubon of the Western Everglades, among others. He had a long career as a plumbing contractor, and as a young Marine in World War II, stormed ashore in the first wave of the American landings on Iwo Jima. Seventy years later, Ted is still battling, on behalf of the environment and all of us.
