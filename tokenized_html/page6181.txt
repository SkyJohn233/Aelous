information systemic inflammation is important in obstructive sleep apnea osa pathophysiology and its comorbidity we aimed to assess the levels of inflammatory biomarkers in a large sample of osa patients and to investigate any correlation between these biomarkers with clinical and polysomnographic psg parameters this was a cross-sectional study in which 2983 patients who had undergone a polysomnography for osa diagnosis were recruited patients with known comorbidities were excluded included patients n 1053 were grouped according to apnea-hypopnea index ahi as mild moderate and severe patients with ahi x02009 x0003c x02009 5 served as controls demographics psg data and levels of high-sensitivity c-reactive protein hs-crp fibrinogen erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and uric acid ua were measured and compared between groups a significant difference was found between groups in hs-crp fibrinogen and ua all biomarkers were independently associated with osa severity and gender p x0003c 0.05 females had increased levels of hs-crp fibrinogen and esr p x0003c 0.001 compared to men in contrast ua levels were higher in men p x0003c 0.001 our results suggest that inflammatory markers significantly increase in patients with osa without known comorbidities and correlate with osa severity these findings may have important implications regarding osa diagnosis monitoring treatment and prognosis this trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov number type clinical-trial attrs text nct03070769 term_id nct03070769 nct03070769 obstructive sleep apnea osa is a highly prevalent sleep disorder and may soon be among the most common chronic diseases in industrialized countries 1 recent data from the united states and europe suggest that between 14 and 49 of middle-aged men has clinically significant osa 2 furthermore it represents an evolving public health challenge due to the associated impairment in quality of life qol and functional capacity alongside with the increased risk of medical comorbidities and mortality 3 in particular the relationship of osa with cardiovascular comorbidity is among the areas of interest the periodic upper airway collapse occurring during sleep in osa patients induces chronic intermittent hypoxia which is thought to promote cardiovascular disease through oxidative stress sympathetic activation and systemic and vascular inflammation 4 x02013 6 recent data have focused on the association between inflammatory biomarkers and osa severity as well as the prediction of cardiovascular events in patients with osa 3 fleming et al suggested that various clusters of biomarkers have an even greater association with osa representing physiologic signatures of the disorder that may have value in initial screening for osa as well as for follow-up of therapy response 7 there are variable biomarkers that are indices of systemic inflammation such as c-reactive protein crp fibrinogen erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and uric acid ua 8 x02013 14 crp a major circulating marker of inflammation mainly produced in the liver is one of the best predictors for future cardiovascular morbidity 6 15 16 crp has been extensively studied in osa and is often found elevated in osa patients especially in association with obesity dyslipidemia diabetes and cardiovascular diseases 6 17 x02013 19 fibrinogen a major coagulation protein associated with inflammation seems to be an important biomarker for cardiovascular risk 20 and its levels have been found to be directly related to apnea-hypopnea index ahi and arousal index ai and inversely related to mean and lowest oxygen saturation during sleep 21 esr which measures the tendency of red blood cells to aggregate is a widely used laboratory test of inflammation and directly associated with atherosclerosis 22 23 however there have been only few reports on the correlation between the severity of osa and plasma esr levels the results of a small retrospective study suggested that there may be a positive association between the plasma esr level and nocturnal oxygen desaturation in obese patients 24 moreover levels of esr high-sensitivity crp hs-crp and fibrinogen have been all found significantly higher in osa patients compared to controls 25 additionally other studies 12 26 27 indicated an association between serum ua levels which is another inflammatory marker with the presence of osa however all the abovementioned markers have been studied mainly in a small number of osa patients in the presence of comorbidities potentially affecting the above results the aim of this study was to investigate possible relationship between osa and biomarkers of inflammation in a large number of osa patients without comorbidities specifically we aimed to assess the circulating levels of four inflammatory markers hs-crp fibrinogen esr and ua in a large population of consecutively enrolled untreated and otherwise healthy osa patients a secondary objective was to investigate potential correlation between these markers and clinical and polysomnographic psg parameters of osa patients we conducted a single-center cross-sectional study of patients who had undergone a psg study for osa diagnosis between june 2012 and june 2016 2983 consecutive patients who were admitted to the sleep disorders center department of thoracic medicine medical school university of crete for evaluation of suspected sleep-disordered breathing were considered as potential recruits for this study the exclusion criteria were as follows refusal to participate previous

diseases 30 x02013 32 the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying these relationships remain unclear but there is evidence to implicate vascular inflammation low-grade inflammation as a mechanism of cardiovascular alteration has been largely studied in osa patients with inflammatory biomarkers as particular targets in order to investigate how early inflammatory mechanisms may be altered in osa we evaluated the association between osa and levels of four circulating inflammatory biomarkers in a large population of consecutively enrolled subjects with a clinical suspicion of osa the current study recruited only those osa patients who were newly diagnosed treatment naive and without any chronic or acute comorbidities therefore the elevated levels of plasma hs-crp fibrinogen and ua in severe osa patients reported were not caused by their presence interestingly our results indicate that females diagnosed with osa had higher levels of hs-crp fibrinogen and esr than men conversely men had higher ua levels than females in all groups of osa severity we subsequently demonstrated important associations between biomarker levels and gender bmi and measures of osa severity such as ahi odi and mean and min sao 2 as inflammation is now recognized to be a characteristic of osa 33 our finding of increased plasma levels in hs-crp fibrinogen and ua in severe osa patients was not unexpected in addition these biomarkers along with esr were strongly correlated with ahi independently of confounding factors such as gender bmi and age reinforcing findings from other studies that demonstrate a robust relationship between these biomarkers and osa severity hs-crp has been the most studied inflammatory protein to date and a frequently used marker to predict the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases cvds a number of studies have demonstrated that hs-crp is a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis and higher hs-crp levels even in the high normal range 0.2 to 1.5 x02009 mg/dl are associated with high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in individuals without known cvd 34 x02013 37 several authors have studied the relationship between ahi and hs-crp levels in osa patients but the results are contradictory possibly due to the role of obesity 6 17 33 38 x02013 42 obesity indeed represents a strong confounding factor that makes difficult to study the respective implications of osa severity in inflammatory biomarker alterations however in a recent meta-analysis patients with osa had a statistically significant higher level of crp and this effect was positively influenced by osa severity 43 we found a relationship between osa severity and hs-crp concentrations in osa patients without comorbidities this relationship although attenuated remained significant after adjusting for bmi and gender furthermore we analyzed separately the subgroup of osa patients with normal bmi in order to eliminate the effect of bmi although there were no significant differences between all groups for hs-crp fibrinogen and ua these results should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size in the osa severity subgroups in normal bmi subjects probably due to losing power x003b2 -error nevertheless hs-crp was still associated with tst90 and fibrinogen with ahi osa-induced hypoxic conditions as well as sleep architecture disturbances due to repeated arousals may be also factors contributing to elevated levels of plasma fibrinogen in osa patients fibrinogen an acute-phase protein synthesized from the liver in response to infection and inflammation is emerging as an important biomarker for cardiovascular risk 44 45 a recently published systemic review has confirmed the significance of elevated fibrinogen for prediction of future cardiovascular risk even in the healthy middle-aged population 46 fibrinogen levels are increased in osa patients 25 47 48 even after adjusting for comorbidities such as arterial hypertension or coronary artery disease implicating hypercoagulability as a specific underlying osa mechanism 20 in a recent study ahi was associated with crp and fibrinogen but these associations were substantially attenuated after adjustment for bmi and comorbidities 11 in our study osa severity as evidenced by oxygen desaturation index during sleep was associated with increased plasma fibrinogen level independent of age bmi and active smoking which is in accordance with a previous study 21 by contrast in one small study hs-crp and fibrinogen were not altered in osa patients 42 other markers of inflammation such as esr are less well studied the esr a cheap and widely used test measures the tendency of red blood cells to aggregate it is elevated in many of the acute and chronic inflammatory diseases 23 and has a possible predictive value for cardiovascular disease 49 however there are not enough data concerning the correlation between the severity of osa and plasma esr levels levels of esr hs-crp and fibrinogen were all found to be significantly higher in osa patients compared to controls 25 min and colleagues suggested that there may be a positive association between esr levels and nocturnal oxygen desaturation although profound only in obese osa patients 24 in the current study the linear regression model presented showed important correlation between ahi odi and minimum sao 2 with esr levels even after controlling for confounders such as gender and bmi finally ua has been linked to osa mainly through oxidative stress as a common pathway recurrent hypoxia associated with osa leads to an increase in the degradation of adenosine triphosphatase into xanthine which in turn increases uric acid concentrations 50 hyperuricemia is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease in osa patients 51 previous studies observed an association between the presence of osa and increased serum uric acid levels 26 27 52 x02013 54 in a representative large sample of the population of sao paulo a strong association was found between ua levels and osa an association that remained significant even after adjustment for confounding factors such as gender age and bmi 12 in accordance with our results furthermore ahi shows a significant linear relationship with ua 55 it is worth noting that recently kosacka and colleagues found that osa patients with increased ua concentration have a higher risk of atherosclerosis as indicated by a higher level of soluble proatherogenic ligand cd40 and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular adverse events 56 previous studies that evaluated the association of osa with markers of inflammation were more prone to selection bias than the current study and most of them included few or no women the current study evaluates the association between treatment naive osa patients without comorbidities and markers of inflammation furthermore we included a relatively large number of women gender differences in systemic inflammation in relation to osa have been previously reported higher crp levels have been found in women compared to men 57 probably due to a greater degree of adiposity in women importantly we also found that in females hs-crp fibrinogen and esr were significantly elevated in women compared to men in almost all osa groups in contrast with ua which was significantly elevated in males in males hs-crp fibrinogen and esr were associated with indices of osa severity after adjustment for confounders however in females the same biomarkers were associated independently only with bmi ua was still associated independently with osa severity in both males and females previously we have shown that female patients with moderate to severe osa had higher although not statistically significant crp values compared to matched males 58 and min et al showed increased esr in female osa patients 24 more recently yardim-akaydin et al 59 showed statistically significant increased values of crp fibrinogen and esr in female osa patients in the present study although there were more males in our patient group the female gender seems to be more connected with increased values of inflammatory biomarkers there are some limitations of the current study that deserve comment firstly the nature of cross-sectional design could not allow us to draw causal relationship between osa and inflammatory biomarkers secondly there were differences between the osa patients and control subjects as the osa patients were older mostly male and more obese nevertheless we performed adjustment for these significant clinical variables in our analysis however despite extensively adjusted for potential confounding variables unrecognized biases regarding our findings still could not be ruled out thirdly the study population consisted of patients without comorbidities thus the study results should be interpreted with caution in patients beyond this particular group given the high prevalence of individuals with osa and the serious health consequences of untreated osa it is likely that detection of osa-induced subclinical disease such as vascular inflammation revealed in our study before the appearance of symptoms may be of value in initial screening for osa adding to pretest probability and therefore to referrals for evaluation furthermore inflammatory biomarker levels may be involved in osa severity and its cardiovascular comorbidities and should be considered in sleep apnea management in the future as healthcare providers should be more aware of the significant health issues associated with osa a simple timely blood test to identify individuals with suspected osa and related cardiovascular consequences is of critical importance in conclusion increased values of systemic inflammatory markers and their correlation with osa severity observed in our study suggest the independent involvement of inflammation in osa however the influence of gender should be taken into account these findings may have important implications regarding osa screening diagnosis treatment monitoring and prognosis the authors declare no conflicts of interests sleep disorders center
