For me, it was when I was 15 yrs old and I went back to Philippines to visit my Mom. Hadn ' t seen her for over 8 years so that was a big happy moment in my life... That and beating my arch-nemesis in  " Pogs "  when I was like 12.... You mean other than when I discovered my dad ' s porn collection? Seeing my mom come home Friday nights after work. is it bad if you can ' t think of one? I don ' t remember being miserable, but no happy moments stand out... I remember when I was about 3 years old and moving into our first house.  That is when I discovered the Filet-o-fish and Mcdonald ' s fries. New Years Eve at Disneyland when I was 11 years old. I remember sitting in my father ' s lap in his wheelchair watching the fireworks. It was one month before he died. I will never forget that moment for as long as I live. First time going to Disneyland. Pretty cliche '  but still one of the happiest moments of my childhood.

Steve K and I went last Sunday. The happiest moments for me were out running overweight cops. You feel unstoppable.  Second, I had a paper route as a kid. Nobody ever told me I had to collect the 5 bucks from each customer at the end of every month. I ' d knock on doors, peer through windows, etc. Finally, I said fuck it. I began delivering the newspaper with dog shit inside the ads section on Sundays. I ' d set nails against their car tires to let the air out slowly. I claimed UPS packages that didn ' t require signatures back then. I ' d order Playgirl magazines for husbands that didn ' t pay up so that wifey could question the hubby. I ' d low crawl to doors looking for feet moving underneath door spaces. I ' d yell obscenities to them through the door space. That made me happy. Yeah a ton of awesome memories at Disneyland for me too.  I get all geeky and shit when I go. I ' ve got that big dog annual pass.  I even went to the point of no return and bought a lanyard with pins.  The GF and I get all geeked.  That ' s even after I worked there for 8 years.

Stephanie  " Jesse ' s Girl "  H. says: Alvin, may I ask what you got your mom? =========== Since my Mother lived in Philippines and I was here... for about almost 8 year we didn ' t see each other so we wrote letters to each other every month. I still have every letter she gave me and had my friend help me into making it into a quilt. So we scanned scanned scanned and found a place to imprint the images onto a big ass quilt for her. All in order by date. It was at least 96 letters. So you can imagine it ended up being a big quilt. Stephanie  " Jesse ' s Girl "  H. says: I know what the hell?!!!

Ok first of all, Alvin, you are amazing.  That is the best present I have ever heard of in my life.... OK now it ' s my turn.  My family has a SHIT LOAD of funny crap but one of my fondest memories are these... My dad went  " out of town "  a lot (looking back, I think it was more for other chicas than work, but the jury is still out on that). Whenever he would go for a weekend, my mom, sister and I would have a special celebration called  " Bachelorette Weekend! " We would make soup on Friday after school, watch girlie movies and sit under a blanket with all the lights off. Saturday we would bake cookies (from scratch, the only way to fly) and make Lasagna and go on an outing to a museum or park Sunday we would sleep in then go for a walk. It was SO MUCH FUN.  Kinda telling actually how my best memory is without dad tho...lol my mom provided me so many great memories I can ' t pick just one... thanks mom falling asleep with my head on my mom or dad ' s lap in between them watching tv after dinner saturday and sunday nights with tamar and salpy ' s family and my family together. our parents would play poker and i remember watching in living color the most with tamar as well as being upstairs in my bedroom which was directly above where they played cards.  we ' d press our ears to the floor and find out if they were talking about us. then we ' d run downstairs and yell at em if they were saying anything questionable. lol it was all in good fun. running in the ditches and hopping fences with daniel, brian, dan, marc, matt, billy and julie.  fudge pops after school! making dozens of lehmajuin from scratch on sundays with my parents.  it was an all day event but that meant AWESOME after school snacks for months.  i ' m grateful for having grown up where i did honestly. the main thing i miss was the slow life.  there ' s a fullfillment with that sort of life. not so easy to explain. :) alvin. So many great stories! keep em going!!!  Happy Friday everyone! (No I Am Not Drunk....yet) Meeting former Laker Great Magic Johnson When I was in the orphanage and a nice white couple would come visit. I ' d think in my head like  " wow!
