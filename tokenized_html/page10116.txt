anya hindmarch notting hill yummy mummy all photos courtesy of nhym 2017 this week has been bustling with activity for london s fashion week fall 17 mums have been dropping off their children at school and then rushing off to fashion shows or events dressed-to-impress i am someone who appreciates fashion i enjoy looking it at and wearing it but you wouldn t say i am a fashionista unlike friends of mine including smart fashionista who has 167k followers because of what she wears hey we all have our strengths i am not fashion forward enough and i like my clothes comfortable read leggings and sweaters uniform for the school run but this week i was busy with my own fashion collaborations with a book signing and talk at anya hindmarch on tuesday for my book the beta mum adventures in alpha land on thursday i was invited to an exclusive cars and fashion ralph lauren event i love both brands and actually have both brands in my closet so makes for the perfect fashion week invitations let s face it there is some fashion that is great to see on a runway but not necessarily to wear my book signing table loved it nhym 2017 on tuesday i was invited to do a small private talk reading book signing and q a session at anya hindmarch in their sloane street shop with the kensington and chelsea women s club a group of international women in london they were a lovely thoughtful and enthusiastic group it was also a chance to browse anya hindmarch s new fall 17 collection while sipping on wine and discussing the trials and tribulations of writing a book this fall s highlight to me was anya hindmarch s build a bag concept which is great fun you take a bag and add lots of fun accessories i particularly like the fluffy pompoms to add to any bag or at least my girls would love them anya s fall collection was a perfect collaboration because it is playful fun and colourful which is how i think the beta mum should be read next up i was invited to a cars and fashion ralph lauren event at their new bond street store last night the perfect combination it appealed to men and women boys and their toys and girls and their dresses some things never change whether you are 5 years old or 50 years old the event was hosted by the beautiful yasmin le bon and had lots of ferraris around this was my absolute favourite room with a red black and white palette of colours sleek sophisticated and luxurious i love rl for those reasons and hopefully there may be a future collaboration in the making i loved both events although they were very different anya hindmarch s collection is channeling colours and fun while ralph lauren is channeling sleek and sophisticated but i d like to think that i can work both styles another fashion week comes to an end and the fashion houses can breathe again next week until the next one thank you anya hindmarch for hosting my book signing and thank you ralph lauren for inviting me to this great event xx nhym http //www.nottinghillyummymummy.com nhyummymummy portovenere italy all photos courtesy of nhym 2017 i just wanted to write a quick note to say hello and welcome back i took the summer off from writing and promoting my book the beta mum adventures in alpha land frankly it was quite wonderful forgetting about book sales and anything related although i did manage a radio interview with irish radio rte sitting by the pool and did manage to appear in the sun no not as a page three girl but still this summer i took the last few weeks of august and travelled around italy and france with trains/planes/boats/automobiles and even tuk tuks for our first cultural family holiday starting in florence and ending in france it was the dolce vita with history art cooking and geography lessons as well as showing my children how others live in small italian towns vernazza italy nhym 2017 coming back to london the sunday before school started was a big shocker people ask how my kids are adapting to being back-to-school they love it but really they should be asking me how it feels to be back-to-reality yes i know you shouldn t feel sorry for me most people have been working all summer but i am having re-entry-into-london-adjustment-issues friends of ours have left london to live in spain/france/the countryside/switzerland and sometimes when i return to the frantic-ness of school gates/school-uniforms/tutors/tests and stress i always wonder whether this is what i want italy eco del mare nhym 2017 but then i go about trying to fall in love with london and it isn t so hard after all there is something special about london when it doesn t rain we are in a vibrant cultural dynamic hub of europe and as i receive invitations to great events i am reminded that this is where things happen the frieze is coming up so soon reminding me that london is an art centre of the world as well as a talk from the ceo of sotheby s i am hoping to attend i am in talks with a charity which would hopefully involve me in something greater than myself or my bubble finally london is where i wrote and published my first book which has overall been such a great creative experience i have my own upcoming events which are quite exciting next week i am having an event with anya hindmarch on tuesday and in a few weeks time i have an event with 3houseclub in st. john s wood for nw8mums only in london would i get these great collaboration opportunities how great is this e-vite i absolutely love it so had to share it please contact me on nottinghillyummymummy hotmail.com if you are interested in coming to any of my events i also have a potentially exciting project in the pipeline which may or may not come to fruition but even just having these discussions is creatively wonderful and of course i am reminded every day how great it is to be in such an international tolerant open-minded educated city when i look around the restaurants the school gates and even while walking down the street and i know this is where i am meant to be right now so here s to being back-to-school back-to-reality and back-to-london i hope you have had a wonderful start to your school year xx nhym http
