galleries for shenakr college completion year 2018 design team geotectura the house reveals and reflects the ideas of sustainability with more than fifty green design features the hope is to raise awareness about green design challenges and solutions ﻿ the eco360 is a single-family four-bedroom home located north of tel aviv the goal of the project designed by geotectura was to build a sustainable home that would be energy-positive and include excellent indoor air and light quality while reflecting the beauty of the surroundings the challenge was even greater as the view of the sea is to the west so traditional passive design solutions that are appropriate for the south façade were not valid in this case an unusual geometrical optimization was needed to obtain all the passive design features while facing the west the house is well insulated and is largely heated by the energy that is generated by body heat and household equipment the entire design team worked with bim building information modeling methodology using environmental simulations during the design process to reach the best optimization the client wanted to build a home that could demonstrate highlight and set an example of what could be done to build a home based on ecological principles with minimal maintenance using solar power a grey water system passive wind strategy high durability and recycled materials the client s hope is that the house will inspire others to consider ways in which they can also use these green principles in building and that it will serve as a model of efficiency and environmental sensitivity completion year 2018 ﻿ press ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ press design team geotectura a floating glass structure for game lab and a media lab 3d printing workshop and more within an

research laboratory design within the eco-wall and in the building in order to make even more cutting edge spaces and environmental benefits opportunities the project is a living lab of ecological and social values for the community and the environment it tells the story of the complex sustainability term and simplifies it to the public by strolling along the eco-wall the ground floor and the roof

decathlon competition completion year 2013 press design team geotectura modu shade is the result of an object blocking sunlight typically the object is stationary eg buildings while the sun is in slow movement producing a shadow that is the direct result of the path of the sun cloud seeding questions this definition of shade—instead it would create shade that is dynamic responsive and fragmented the shadows of cloud seeding would be the result of thousands of objects or seeds in constant movement overhead the proposal consists of a flat ceiling made of a clear structural film/mesh the ceiling supports twenty-thousand hollow recycled plastic balls which move freely with the wind across the surface of the ceiling the resulting shade is not from a single—or a few—stationary objects instead the changing shadows would be from thousands of moving seeds. client holon design museum completion year 2015 press ﻿ design team geotectura efrat gilboa environmental sculpture client rishon lezion

cleantech amongst the israeli public we aim to influence the development of a leading green energy industry in israel through education and exposure of environmental technologies walking in to the center your eyes go directly to the large cube displays that line the walkway to the ecological house the creation of the solar garden was first inspired by the massive attention that was received from the cube installations designed by geotectura are an ideological art project to show people how simple it is to harness solar energy the idea behind the cube is similar to earth earth has a limited amount of resources by installing solar panels we can use the sun to bring in outside resources instead of using the limited resources available the cube is symbolizing the earth as a closed box of resources adding a solar panel allows us to bring in the electricity resource from outside the cube client the solar garden completion year 2009 press design team geotectura in zerohome we

waste to the earth all these simple things are somehow perceived as unattainable in our culture – who has the time the house gives us this time connects us to our most basic of needs and asks are we

abandoning for a few moments the cellophane wrapper of our culture will be invited to acknowledge the unsustainable nature of the western culture dream of progress and to connect with a dream well-hidden that of a sustainable beautiful and human world at the physical level the house is disconnected from the infrastructural grid sewage electricity water and gas the grid while still meeting all existential needs water food appropriate conditions for sleep hosting work and rest and recycling secretions and leftovers showing that we can live comfortably without damaging the environment we
