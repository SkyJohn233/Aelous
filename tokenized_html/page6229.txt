windows 7 wikipedia windows 7 is a personal computer operating system that was produced by microsoft as part of the windows nt family of operating systems it was released to manufacturing on july 22 2009 and became generally available on october 22 2009 9 less than three years after the release of its predecessor windows vista windows 7 's server counterpart windows server 2008 r2 was released at the same time microsoft ended mainstream support for windows 7 on january 13 2015 but extended support will not end until january 14 2020 windows 7 was primarily intended to be an incremental upgrade to microsoft windows intended to address windows vista 's poor critical reception while maintaining hardware and software compatibility windows 7 continued improvements on windows aero the user interface introduced in windows vista with the addition of a redesigned taskbar that allows applications to be pinned to it and new window management features other new features were added to the operating system including libraries the new file sharing system homegroup and support for multitouch input a new action center interface was also added to provide an overview of system security and maintenance information and tweaks were made to the user account control system to make it less intrusive windows 7 also shipped with updated versions of several stock applications including internet explorer 8 windows media player and windows media center in contrast to windows vista windows 7 was generally praised by critics who considered the operating system to be a major improvement over its predecessor due to its increased performance its more intuitive interface with particular praise devoted to the new taskbar fewer user account control popups and other improvements made across the platform windows 7 was a major success for microsoft even prior to its official release pre-order sales for 7 on the online retailer amazon.com had surpassed previous records in just six months over 100 million copies had been sold worldwide increasing to over 630 million licenses by july 2012 as of november 2019 update 27.98 of traditional pcs running windows are running windows 7 and thus 22 of all traditional pcs 10 which still has over 60 market share in some countries 11 12 originally a version of windows codenamed blackcomb was planned as the successor to windows xp and windows server 2003 in 2000 major features were planned for blackcomb including an emphasis on searching and querying data and an advanced storage system named winfs to enable such scenarios however an interim minor release codenamed longhorn was announced for 2003 delaying the development of blackcomb 13 by the middle of 2003 however longhorn had acquired some of the features originally intended for blackcomb after three major malware outbreaks—the blaster nachi and sobig worms—exploited flaws in windows operating systems within a short time period in august 2003 14 microsoft changed its development priorities putting some of longhorn 's major development work on hold while developing new service packs for windows xp and windows server 2003 development of longhorn windows vista was also restarted and thus delayed in august 2004 a number of features were cut from longhorn 15 blackcomb was renamed vienna in early 2006 16 when released windows vista was criticized for its long development time performance issues spotty compatibility with existing hardware and software on launch changes affecting the compatibility of certain pc games and unclear assurances by microsoft that certain computers shipping with xp prior to launch would be vista capable which led to a class action lawsuit among other critiques as such adoption of vista in comparison to xp remained somewhat low 17 18 19 in july 2007 six months following the public release of vista it was reported that the next version of windows would then be codenamed windows 7 with plans for a final release within three years 20 21 bill gates in an interview with newsweek suggested that windows 7 would be more user-centric 22 gates later said that windows 7 would also focus on performance improvements 23 steven sinofsky later expanded on this point explaining in the engineering windows 7 blog that the company was using a variety of new tracing tools to measure the performance of many areas of the operating system on an ongoing basis to help locate inefficient code paths and to help prevent performance regressions 24 senior vice president bill veghte stated that windows vista users migrating to windows 7 would not find the kind of device compatibility issues they encountered migrating from windows xp 25 an estimated 1,000 developers worked on windows 7 these were broadly divided into core operating system and windows client experience in turn organized into 25 teams of around 40 developers on average 26 in october 2008 it was announced that windows 7 would also be the official name of the operating system 27 28 there has been some confusion over naming the product windows 7 29 while versioning it as 6.1 to indicate its similar build to vista and increase compatibility with applications that only check major version numbers similar to windows 2000 and windows xp both having 5.x version numbers 30 the first external release to select microsoft partners came in january 2008 with milestone 1 build 6519

by zdnet 35 windows 7 beta beat both windows xp and vista in several key areas including boot and shutdown time and working with files such as loading documents other areas did not beat xp including pc pro benchmarks for typical office activities and video editing which remain identical to vista and slower than xp 36 on january 7 2009 the x64 version of the windows 7 beta build 7000 was leaked onto the web with some torrents being infected with a trojan 37 38 at ces 2009 microsoft ceo steve ballmer announced the windows 7 beta build 7000 had been made available for download to msdn and

affecting newer windows versions i.e. windows 7 and all recent versions as well 108 in addition experts reported a microsoft security vulnerability cve 2019-1162 based on legacy code involving microsoft ctf and ctfmon ctfmon.exe that affects all windows versions from the older windows xp version to the most recent windows 10 versions a patch to correct the flaw is currently available 109 in september 2019 microsoft announced that it would provide free security updates for windows 7 on federally-certified voting machines through the 2020 united states elections 110 additional requirements to use certain features 111 the maximum amount of ram that windows 7 supports varies depending on the product edition and on the processor architecture as shown in the following table 113 windows 7 professional and up support up to 2 physical processors cpu sockets 114 whereas windows 7 starter home basic and home premium editions support only 1 115 physical processors with either multiple cores or hyper-threading or both implement more than one logical processor per physical processor the x86 editions of windows 7 support up to 32 logical processors x64 editions support up to 256 4 x 64 116 in january 2016 microsoft announced that it would no longer support windows platforms older than windows 10 on any future intel-compatible processor lines citing difficulties in reliably allowing the operating system to operate on newer hardware microsoft stated that effective july 17 2017 devices with intel skylake cpus were only to receive the most critical updates for windows 7 and 8.1 and only if they have been judged not to affect the reliability of windows 7 on older hardware 101 117 for enterprise customers microsoft issued a list of skylake-based devices certified for windows 7 and 8.1 in addition to windows 10 to assist them in migrating to newer hardware that can eventually be upgraded to 10 once they are ready to transition microsoft and their hardware partners provide special testing and support for these devices on 7 and 8.1 until the july 2017 date 118 on march 18 2016 in response to criticism from enterprise customers microsoft delayed the end of support and non-critical updates for skylake systems to july 17 2018 but stated that they would also continue to receive security updates through the end of extended support 119 120 in august 2016 citing a strong partnership with our oem partners and intel microsoft retracted the decision and stated that it would continue to support windows 7 and 8.1 on skylake hardware through the end of their extended support lifecycle however the restrictions on newer cpu microarchitectures remain in force 121 122 in march 2017 a microsoft knowledge base article was discovered which implies that devices using intel kaby lake amd bristol ridge or amd ryzen would be blocked from using windows update entirely 123 124 in addition official windows 7 device drivers are not available for the kaby lake and ryzen platforms 125 126 security updates released since march 2018 contain bugs which affect processors that do not support sse2 extensions including all pentium iii processors microsoft initially stated that it would attempt to resolve the issue and prevented installation of the affected patches on these systems however on june 15 2018 microsoft retroactively modified its support documents to remove the promise that this bug would be resolved replacing it with a statement suggesting that users obtain a newer processor this effectively ends future patch support for windows 7 on these systems 127

service pack 1 in february 2011 and remained absent for 14 months despite microsoft reporting that it was still present subsequently described by microsoft as a technical error as a result in march 2013 the european commission fined microsoft €561 million to deter companies from reneging on settlement promises 137 the platform update for windows 7 sp1 and windows server 2008 r2 sp1 was released on february 26 2013 138 after a pre-release version had been released on november 5 2012 139 it is also included with internet explorer 10 for windows 7 140 it includes enhancements to direct2d directwrite direct3d windows imaging component wic windows advanced rasterization platform warp windows animation manager wam xps document api h.264 video decoder and jpeg xr decoder 138 however support for direct3d 11.1 is limited as the update does not include dxgi wddm 1.2 from windows 8 making unavailable many related apis and significant features such as stereoscopic frame buffer feature level 11_1 and optional features for levels 10_0 10_1 and 11_0 141 in october 2013 a disk cleanup wizard addon was released that lets users delete outdated windows updates on windows 7 sp1 thus

reliability updates are cumulative downloading and installing updates that address individual problems is no longer possible but the number of updates that must be downloaded to fully update the os is significantly reduced 146 windows 7 received critical acclaim with critics noting the increased usability and functionality when compared with its predecessor windows vista cnet gave windows 7 home premium a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars 147 stating that it is more than what vista should have been and it 's where microsoft needed to go pc magazine rated it a 4 out of 5 saying that windows 7 is a

windows vista to windows 7 must either pay 219.99 161 to upgrade to windows 7 ultimate or perform a clean install which requires them to reinstall all of their programs 162 the changes to user account control on windows 7 were criticized for being potentially insecure as an exploit was discovered allowing untrusted software to be launched with elevated privileges by exploiting a trusted component peter bright of ars technica argued that the way that the windows 7 uac 'improvements have been made completely exempts microsoft 's developers from having to do that work themselves with windows 7 it 's one rule for redmond another one for everyone else 163 microsoft 's windows kernel engineer mark russinovich acknowledged the problem but noted that malware can also compromise a system when users agree to a prompt 85 164 in july 2009 in only eight hours pre-orders of windows 7 at amazon.co.uk surpassed the demand which windows vista had in its first 17 weeks 165 it became the highest-grossing

features that consumers will want that also do n't run afoul of regulators 184 in order to comply with european antitrust regulations microsoft proposed the use of a ballot screen containing download links to competing web browsers thus removing the need for a version of windows completely without internet explorer as previously planned 185 in response to criticism involving windows 7 e and concerns from manufacturers about possible consumer confusion if a version of windows 7 with internet explorer were shipped later after one without internet explorer microsoft announced that it would discard the separate version for europe and ship the standard upgrade and full packages worldwide 186 as with the previous version of windows an n version which does not come with windows media player has been released in europe but only for sale directly from microsoft sales websites and selected others 187
