featured guest leave a comment beautiful earth with barbra white celebrating the great mother through dynamic explorations around embodiment natures gifts sexuality food and emotional awareness topic this month we host sexual empowerment coach and best selling author of lesbian sex secrets for men amy jo goddard amy jo goddard the most common question i hear is how did you get into this work since helping people with their sexuality isn t your everyday occupation people are often curious about it my work as a sexual empowerment expert has spanned over 20 years and came directly out of my feminist work to empower women in their bodies relationships and in the world it came out of my own history of not having the resources and guides i truly needed when i was grappling with difficult things about my sexuality i know this is a very common human dilemma we all need guides i went on to find many mentors in my life who i ve learned from and who have championed me to become the best version of myself i can be and i in turn offer that mentorship to the people i help i m a california-new york hybrid with a passion for passion i m here to live full-out and to explore the depths it s my scorpio nature sexuality is so vast i believe it is the core of who we are when it s wonky it impacts everything in our lives work creativity relationships money all things suffer when we are not in right relationship with the most intimate part of ourselves and when we are in right relationship with it everything opens up our sexuality is such an expansive part of who we are that when we expand our relationship to it it helps us to be bigger not just in the bedroom but in the whole of our lives amy jo goddard i do not believe any of us are broken we might be hurt we might have been abandoned or abused we may have had some traumatic experiences in our lives we may feel really disconnected from our body and our desire but we are whole and sometimes we are searching for the parts that maybe got lost along the way i have had thousands of conversations with people about sexuality personal conversations where the most tender parts of people are revealed it s such an honor to receive those precious revelations and the trust of a person who shares their personal story we all have a sexual story—and i think most people want to know its depths what i hear over and over is that people want freedom vibrancy and to live life more fully and with more pleasure—they know these things will come from breaking through in their sexuality i know this to be true because i ve had the joy of witnessing it so many times in my life s work the women who come to me tend to be creative people on a spiritual path—they know that breaking through sexually is the obvious next step in their evolution as fully self-actualized people i co-wrote the best-selling lesbian sex secrets for men although i think more women have read it than men now available in a second edition this book shifts the perspective on sex away from the myopic lens that gets most people stuck and opens up new possibilities for how to approach sex women s bodies and pleasure for more information please visit

health program and the science of aging gracefully denise medved is a woman with a vision formed by a lifetime of facing struggle with optimism grit and perseverance s he is the creator of ageless grace a brain fitness program with the purpose of changing the model of aging in this world ageless grace is a cutting-edge brain fitness program based on neuroplasticity that activates all 5 functions of the brain – analytical strategic kinesthetic learning memory/recall creativity and imagination – and simultaneously addresses all 21 physical skills needed for lifelong optimal function in the simplest terms neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain and central nervous system to change form and function throughout one s lifetime specifically when stimulated by various physical activities each of the ageless grace tools or exercises emphasizes a different anti-aging technique such as joint mobility balance spinal flexibility right-left brain coordination upper body strength development of new neural pathways dexterity of the feet and hands systemic health oxygenation of the cells increased self-esteem confidence and playfulness the easy-to-learn tools promote the three rs of lifelong comfort and ease – not reading ´riting and ´arithmetic—but the ability to respond react and recover quickly efficiently and safely the movements in the program are designed to be performed seated in a chair to activate and work the core muscle group stimulate the systems of the body i.e digestive endocrine lymphatic respiratory etc and help maintain optimal organ function however they can be done on a bed standing near or behind a chair down on the floor or standing when created it was denise s intention that anyone could perform the movements in ageless grace whether recovering from a surgery or at the peak of health – and that anyone of any age or ability can be certified to teach the program and inspire others to practice this cutting-edge brain elasticity program intentionally nourishing the mind-body connection on a daily basis can help improve health and well-being reduce stress keep the brain agile and the body responsive when body mind spirit and emotions are in balance health and well-being follow ageless grace offers something for each of these dimensions the biggest difference between ageless grace and other fitness programs is that ageless grace is meant to both exercise the body and stimulate the brain research now supports that we must combine the two for optimal lifelong function and graceful aging and that we must continue to practice movements we are unfamiliar with in order to create new neural pathways for more information please visit agelessgrace.com airtime 1-2 p.m. spirituality journey into oneness bodymindspirit
