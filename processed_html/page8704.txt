Some of these factors include the time of year, amount of base running and a history of previous hamstring injury. Researchers assessed 2011 data from the Major League Baseball ' s Injury Surveillance System. Lead researcher Christopher Ahmad, M.D., reviewed factors, like time lost from injury, the date of injury and the activity the player was participating in at the time of the injury, from all minor and major league teams. Injury rates were reported based on the injuries per athlete exposure. Athlete exposures were defined as the average amount of players in a game multiplied by the total number of games. Major vs. minor league baseball The data revealed that there were 50 hamstring strains in the major leagues, and 218 in the minor league teams. The injury rate was 0.7 per 1,000 athlete exposures, and was the same in both leagues. However, more time was lost for minor league players than it was for those in the major league. Minor league players lost 27 days of playing time on average, and major league players lost around 24. Hamstring injuries were mostly attributed to running bases - mainly, running to first base. Running to first base was responsible for two-thirds of the recorded hamstring injuries. Twenty-five percent of these injuries caused players to be out for more than one month, and 66 percent caused players to be out more than seven days. Twenty percent of major league players and 8 percent of minor league players sustained a previous hamstring injury in the 2010 baseball season. Most major league players ' hamstring injuries took place in the early months of the season.
