Best Pizza in Brighton - Review of Martinella Brighton-Bay Pizza  &  Pasta, Brighton, Australia - TripAdvisor Don't let the simplicity of d√©cor (including the strange hand drawn pictures) be deceiving. Prepare yourself for some of the best pizza you'll ever eat. Great crust, not over done, and not mushy, plenty of toppings, all cooked just right. Didn't try any of the pasta dishes, so no idea how they taste, but the pizza is excellent. 12  -  16  of  22  reviews Our family has found a new favourite! Suitable to dine outside with our dog also! Food is fabulous, fun and always consistent. Do you love pizza with loads of toppings, then this is the place to go..... Lots of difference options, fresh and filling. I love the pizza at this place. I have been going here since I was a child and they were further down Bay Street. The place is always packed and they do a roaring delivery trade. they are very efficient and friendly and really know their pizzas. What a great staff, also the food, best cannelloni ever not to mention that seafood pizza. The wine was reasonably priced as well. Great job will be back. Own or manage this property?
