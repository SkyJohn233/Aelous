like to have more money students however often fail to understand that the real value of money is determined by the goods and services money can buy doubling the amount of money in an economy overnight would not by itself make people better off because there would still be the same amount of goods and services produced and consumed only at higher prices money is important to an economy however because as it replaces barter it makes exchange less costly as a result people are more likely to specialize in what they produce using money to buy what they want to consume thus increasing overall levels of production and consumption in a nation understanding what determines the real buying power of money and earnings will help students make better decisions about their jobs and spending understanding the importance of money to society will also help them make informed decisions about national policies related to banking controlling the supply of money and inflation return to top of page interest rates influence the borrowing and saving of business investors consumers and government agencies most people are unfamiliar with interest rates until they borrow money for a major purchase such as an automobile college education or a house when they enter the market for credit they encounter an unfamiliar price the interest rate offered by an unfamiliar business a financial institution it is necessary for students to understand that interest rates are determined by market forces that balance savings and borrowing for many people interest rates can represent significant financial costs and significant financial benefits over a lifetime it is also important for students to understand the incentive effects of interest rates interest payments compensate savers for postponing current consumption they compensate lenders for the risk that borrowers might default on their loans and they cover the cost of expected inflation over the term of the loan return to top of page in a market economy wages and salaries the prices of labor services are determined just as other prices are by the interaction of buyers and sellers the buyers of labor services are employers they are willing to pay higher wages and salaries to employees who can produce more or better goods or services in a given amount of time students who understand this will appreciate the value of the skills they can acquire by completing high school and perhaps college or a vocational training program understanding the forces affecting wages and other sources of income will be increasingly important in the future when workers may change employers and careers more often than in the past regardless of the occupations or industries in which today s students eventually work they are likely to find that they will have to continue their education and training to maintain or increase their earnings return to top of page starting a new business such as a drive thru that sells fruit-freezes is difficult and risky challenges abound hiring and managing the workers to make and serve the freezes ordering supplies and making sure they arrive on time giving prompt and courteous service so customers will return and earning enough money to pay workers taxes suppliers and everyone else involved in the production and sales process while still leaving something for the owner spending money and using resources to supply a product is risky because costs are incurred before consumers decide whether they will purchase the product at a price sufficiently high to cover the costs starting a new business or producing an entirely new product is especially risky because in the case of a new product producers know even less about how consumers will react entrepreneurs accept the risks and organize productive resources to get products produced profits are the financial incentive and the income that entrepreneurs receive in return for their effort and risk if they are successful if they are not successful losses are the financial incentives that tell entrepreneurs to stop using resources as they have been using them understanding the roles of entrepreneurs profits and losses is important to workers business owners and consumers wages and employment opportunities at a business depend on the business success in earning profits and avoiding losses similarly public policies that affect the profitability of a business will influence not only the owners and employees of the business but also the consumers who buy the products produced by the business return to top of page students should recognize that by saving and investing money today they can benefit in the future by being able to buy such things as a car a compact disc player a trip to an amusement park or other things that cost more than they can afford immediately they will face similar trade-offs throughout their lives as adults they will save for many things other than toys and vacations including housing medical expenses taxes household and automobile repairs their children s education and their own retirement savings deposited in banks and other financial institutions earn interest because those savings are loaned to businesses that want to invest in capital goods or to people who are willing to pay higher interest rates to purchase homes cars or other things now rather than later the new physical capital will in turn increase production and promote faster economic growth businesses governments and other organizations face decisions similar to those confronting individuals future benefits that arise from saving and investing today make it worthwhile to sacrifice some current spending knowing this will help students understand the various investment and dividend programs adopted by different corporations as well as public policies involving taxation spending programs and investment in infrastructure education and other things that will increase future standards of living it will help them appreciate that a better life in the future often requires patience and sacrifice in the present it also will help them understand the importance of personal investment in education and training and of business investments return to top of page copyright 2019 the foundation for teaching economics all rights reserved
