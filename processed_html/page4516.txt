TECH TIP Test tyre pressures at least once per month with a pressure gauge. Testing by thumb is completely unreliable as with just half of the required pressure the tyre will feel hard. Insufficient air pressure is the most common bicycle problem that results in dramatically increased rolling resistance and premature tyre wear.
