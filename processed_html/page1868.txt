Malt Maniacs Awards | A Wardrobe of Whisky Malt Maniacs Awards is a fierly  independent  whisky Awards where a team of twelve certified  malt maniacs  members  taste blindly  whiskies submited by distilleries and bottlers, with a limit of 3 per distillery. There are heavy weights on the tasting panel with  Serge Valentin  and other great whisky bloggers. The whiskies are scored between 0 and 100 and assigned a gold medal to those above 90 points which it is still a  great rare honor . Those between 85 and 90 get a silver and those between 80 and 85 get a bronze medal. They also highlight daily drams whiskies, which it is a very nice thing as most of the gold medals are beyond a common budget.1 Check other  whisky competitions  at the  Awards  section.
