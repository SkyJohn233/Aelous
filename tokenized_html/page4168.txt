in need of help with a chemistry question yahoo answers some antacid products that bubble when added to a glass of water contain both sodium bicarbonate and citric acid when an antacid tablet is dropped in water citric acid reacts with sodium bicarbonate the chemical equation for this reaction is nahco3 aq c6h8o7 aq h2o i co2 g nac6h7o7 aq a what mass of c6h8o7 is needed to consume 0.42 g of nahco3 b what mass of water is expected 0.42g 84.00g/mol 0.0050 mols its a 1:1 ratio so the moles of nahco3 are the same as citric acid 0.0050g *192.12g/mols =0.96 grams citic acid 0.0050 mols 1mol h2o 1mol citric acid 0.0050 mol h2o 0.0050 18g/mol 0.09 grams h2o note the molar ratios in the eq x27 n are 1:1 :1:1:1 relative molecular mass mr of nahco3 na x 1 23 x 1 23 h x 1 1 x1 1 c x 1 12 x 1 12 o x 3 16 x 3 48 23 1 12 48 84 moles nahco3 0.42 84 0.005 equivalent to x27 1 x27 in the molar ratios above moles c6h8o7 0.005 equivalent to x27 1 x27 in the molar ratios above mr c6h8o7 c x 6 12 x 6 72 h x 8 1 x 8 8 o x 7 16 x 7 112 v 72 8 112 192 mass c6h8o7 0.005 x 192 0.96 g mass h2o 0.005 x 18 0.09 g done
