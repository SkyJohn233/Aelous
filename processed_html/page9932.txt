Selena Gomez to Swear Off Men, Become Born-Again Virgin - The Hollywood Gossip Justin Bieber is currently sleeping his way through half the western hemisphere. According to recent reports, the singer has slept with  Barbara Palvin ...  Yovanna Ventura ... and  Adriana Lima . All within the past few weeks. But In Touch Weekly claims Selena Gomez is taking the opposite approach from her ex-boyfriend, vowing to keep her legs crossed until she walks down the aisle some day down the line. "Selena has told friends she’s completely swearing off men until she’s married. She wants to be a born-again virgin," an anonymous friend tells the tabloid. This claim  might  be plausible... if the story didn't also allege Gomez has "renewed her devotion" to the Lord following that ridiculous, inappropriate  Selena Gomez miscarriage  report. Still, if Selena  has  "swapped drinking and partying for all things Jesus," as In Touch Weekly concludes, hey, more power to you. We doubt Jesus will lead you on and sleep with models and sing mean song lyrics about you... unlike a certain young singer who ironically has a Jesus tattoo on his calf.  I'm not going to be a solo artist. I want to be in a band with four other guys.  I'm kind of lame. I prefer quiet evenings at home, hanging out with my family. Submissions? Questions?
