have just begun to trickle in the response so far is mostly positive even if it honestly looks like a revved-up film adaptation of the videogame paperboy metacritic 65/100 rotten tomatoes 71 what to watch for jgl as a box-office draw – premium rush marks the actor s first time as the headlining performer of a major release he took 500 days of summer and 50/50 to relatively strong grosses but can

release to only 810 theaters which suggests that this apparition won t be a pleasant one metacritic n/a rotten tomatoes 0 what to watch for the leads – it might seem like a cop-out to say that but the three principle actors of the apparition have a lot to gain – or lose – with this feature they re untested as leading actors let alone box-office draws and it s therefore uncertain if any of them – let all alone all of them – can carry a film hit and run directed by david palmer and dax shepard written by dax shepard starring dax shepard kristen bell bradley cooper theater count 2,870 what s it about charlie bronson tries to get his girlfriend to los angeles that doesn t sound like much of a problem but he risks his witness protection plan to do so and his past as a former getaway driver doesn t help matters for those reasons bronson must avoid his former gang and the government while helping his girlfriend dax shepard plays bronson while kristen bell plays his girlfriend early reaction most critics are mixed on hit and run the main criticism being that its comedy misses more often than it hits our own steven chaitman leaned a bit more with the positive folks in his review hit and run could be a stepping stone to something bigger and better from shepard who might find more success if he took his brand to television or simply found a way to keep the energy up in future films so that the jokes will hit harder in the meantime hit and run avoids being total late-august junk even if most will discover it down the road as a surprisingly decent rental. what to watch for

apparently everlasting fire the film derives from one of director/co-writer d souza s popular books 2016 scored a limited release in july but now it gets a nationwide release early reaction most critics haven t bothered much with this one but 2016 has pulled in 2.5 million from just its limited release while those aren t phenomenal numbers it s clear that this film has an audience albeit a very specific one metacritic n/a rotten tomatoes n/a what to watch for the media firestorm from both sides of the political spectrum – grab your popcorn folks though it s already played at select
