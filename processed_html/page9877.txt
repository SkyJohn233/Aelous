GST zero-rated: BMW prices reduced by up to RM70k Now that  Volkswagen Malaysia  has announced its price list with the  goods and services tax (GST)  rated at  0% from June 1, 2018 , compatriot BMW has followed suit with its own revised list. The rolling back of GST was announced by the Pakatan Harapan ruling government  earlier this week .  These prices are on-the-road, excluding insurance, and will take effect until the sales and services tax (SST) is reinstated to replace GST. However, no date was given for the return of SST. Calculated thus, the savings for purchase of new BMW vehicles in Malaysia range from RM9,992 for the  BMW 118i Sport , up to RM69,877 for the  mid-engined, plug-in hybrid i8 .  The revised pricing appears to be interim, as BMW Malaysia states that prices are listed as such until further notice from the Ministry of Finance. Below is the table reflecting current prices before the change, after and the difference. “While we await further announcements and confirmation from the Ministry of Finance Malaysia, we look forward to continue serving our customers seamlessly. Rest assured, BMW Group Malaysia continues to offer the complete Premium Ownership experience,” said managing director and CEO of BMW Group Malaysia Harald Hoetzl.  The revised prices include BMW s five-year unlimited warranty with free scheduled service programme, 24-month tyre warranty programme for run-flat tyres, roadside assistance and accident hotline, the BMW Group Loyalty+ mobile app, BMW White Card and BMW Excellence Club membership programme, and BMW Service Online.
