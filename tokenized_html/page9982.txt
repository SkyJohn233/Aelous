genesect 's location use and origin pokébase pokémon answers so i was curious about this guy and looked up his pokédex entry for starters it says that it can be obtained in gen v a generation that i 've played but i 've never encounter it nor as a normal 'mon or as a legendary plus the dex entry of black states that over 300 million years ago it was feared as the strongest of hunters it has been modified by team plasma while the white one comments this ancient bug pokémon was altered by team plasma they upgraded the cannon on its back this made me think as i 've read around here some people think that it is a *kabutops with an exoskeleton** made by team plasma* but if you ask me that does n't make a lot of sense ** why first the typing genesect is steel/bug while kabutops is water/rock second the shape i 've come to notice that the most brought up reason as to why genesect would be a kabutops is because the heads resemble each other by this logic i could say that genesect is actually a scyther because their torso is way more similar and the typing would actually make more sense what leaves me perplexed is the cannon mentioned in the white pokédex 's entry they upgraded the cannon on its back does this mean it already had one but none of the pokémon known to us except mega blastoise but he is out of the question have a cannon on their back and are at least partially bug type so far at least so concluding here 's what i 'd like to know thanks in advance guys entries genesect kabutops scyther ok here goes nothing~ no genesect was an event pokemon that was distributed in mostly worldwide as the case with most other event pokemon it can not be obtained in any manner after it 's event has passed this genesect was distributed over wi-fi from october 7 to november 12 2012 due to differences in game release dates it first became available in the united states on october 7 in australia on october 11 and in europe on october 12 it 's stats are n't it 's main attraction but the way they are placed are important it has the perfect stats for a mixed attacker genesect 's movepool is n't too shabby either it gets ice beam flash cannon flamethrower extreme speed and u-turn the biggest thing about it is it 's great ability download the ability is almost tailor-made for it as this makes genesect a ferocious scarfed revenge killer being able to hit the opponent 's weaker defense here 's what download exactly does download raises either the bearer 's attack or special attack by one stage when switching into battle base on the opponent 's defenses it raises attack if the opponent 's defense is lower than its special defense or raises special attack if opponent 's special defense is lower than or equal to its defense lastly there has been no evidence that genesect has been derived from any other pokemon at all while many people do guess that it 's a hybrid/prehistoric version of a pokemon already known there 's also a much more likely possibility that it 's just a different pokemon it may have looked the same way as it does minus the cannon maybe the movies have n't provided any solid links about it other than the fact that they live in groups of possibly five or more hope i helped there were two genesect events in gen v one for a lv 15 normal genesect knowing its signature move techno blast and several for a shiny genesect with the moves blaze kick extremespeed shift gear and techno blast but one was only in japan genesect is only obtainable via event in gen v. genesect makes for one of the best attackers in the game with his impressive bulk vast movepool and decent offensive stats the most dangerous thing about genesect though is download giving it a +1 boost in the attacking stat that targets the opponent 's weakest defense this turned its already repectable offensive abilities into a monstrous new threat here are the main things that genesect can do all we know is pokédex entries and speculation but genesect did star in the movie genesect and the legend awakened co-starring mega mewtwo y
