Itâ€™s acceptable for your midriff to be exposed when wearing a sari, but not otherwise. Shorts and short skirts are not acceptable upto knee level is fine. Tops should not show your cleavage or be too tight or revealing. Leave your sheer blouses, shorts, spaghetti-strap dresses, bikinis, tank tops, etc., at home. While sleeveless tops are becoming more common in some of Indiaâ€™s big cities during the hot season, in general they are not acceptable; however, short sleeves are usually OK. There is no specific dress code but knee long dresses recommended. At hotels especially 4/5 star no dress code - normally avoid micro mini skirts . However during city tour avoid half pant as In Indian City tour Religious place are also part of the Sightseeing . Wear anything you like to wear which makes you feel good. Huh? Kamal? So if a person feels good in a mini skirt and spaghetti strap dress then go ahead and wear it?!

I think there are 2 things going on here in this thread. 1) I believe the OP was asking about dress code in the evenings AT THE HOTELS her tour is staying at. They will be 4/5 star hotels. The answer to this is that you can wear casual dressy attire, but nothing too skimpy or revealing. 2) some of the people like Rashidagraindia replying here are replying in general about the general dress code while out in PUBLIC in  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-85384849', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); India . He gave good advice. Avoid shorts and revealing tops. Capri pants and longer skirts are more appropriate for females. Longer shorts are fine for men. If you go to  Goa , more western style clothing is ok Safe Travels. Purple girl  ðŸ˜‚ You women/girl are only hope to those Indian girls who are already wearing micro minis ...now if you wear full dress what their parent will say see now even foreigner wearing our traditional dress ðŸ˜Ž If you don ' t want other to gaze you wear full dress if you don ' t care about others wear what ever you feel. Salsajo, ðŸ˜‚ Omg long shorts for men ðŸ¤” Kamal, You are so funny, i admire your flexibility ðŸ˜‰ Actually while i was in the North and Rajahstan i used to put casual outfits, jeans and tops mainly and maxi dresses but those who wanted to stare they did anyway.. i think it is more about feeling curious about foreigners than the dress code itself and this was not harmful at all.It is about seeing something unusual same when an Indian walk in NYC streets putting a Saree people will be interested to look at her as it is not something common. Regards Inaya Inaya  ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜âœŒâœŒ Dhanywad  You are right people will always give you a second look and some will stare best to ignore them. But I believe Indian dresses are pretty , one should definitely try it for a change.
