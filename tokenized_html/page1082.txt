oldest the best-selling author tells the story behind the very very long road to baghdad so you ve changed direction and produced a book set during the first world war a friend asked change in direction long road to baghdad was the first novel i wrote it s just taken 25 years to reach publication in 1980 i read a filler in the swansea gazette featuring walter greenway a public schoolboy turned cat burglar rehabilitated he joined the merchant navy and landed in mesopotamia in 1914 where he married a native and spied for the british against the turk before dying heroically i found the story fascinating i d never heard of a british/turkish conflict and spent hours in the imperial war museum researching walter before coming to the conclusion that despite the subscriptions set up to provide for his widow and children in 1917 he was almost certainly a product of the war office propaganda department i didn t abandon the project because by then i d read the privately published papers and times reports of edmund candler the official eyewitness in mesopotamia heart-breaking accounts of how british troops were sent into battle while the hospital ships were still at sea how candler watched the wounded laid on mud in a rainstorm and slowly – infinitely slowly – sinking and drowning the letters he received from wives and mother begging him to search for their missing sons and husbands the more i read about the war labelled a sideshow by the war office the less i understood why the courage and bravery not to mention 97,000 british lives the conflict cost had been ignored then i met christopher marley a lively energetic 90 year old who d been photographed by swansea s evening post holding a death certificate that stated he d died of cholera in baghdad in 1917 the disease decimated the british forces even killing army commander general stanley maude in november 1917 i listened enthralled as he related tales of joining the welsh volunteers in 1915 and was sent out to mesopotamia via india to acclimatise to relieve a force of 15,000 british troops held under siege by the turks in kut al amara short of rations kit ammunition food a flyweight boxer christopher fought the champion of the black watch and won a side of bacon too small to be shared between two regiments he told me about chickens that strutted with their heads in the air eating flies because the ground was sterile about living off one tin of blown bully beef and four cream crackers a day and marching in temperatures of 130°f the thermometer couldn t register higher i set my novel in mesopotamia in 1914 where tension in the middle east is escalating between the british and the arabs it s an epic love story between misfit british lieutenant harry downe who is sent to negotiate a treaty with a renegade bedouin tribe and the sheikh s daughter he is persuaded to marry in secret as part of the deal basing the character on the wartime exploits of war hero lieutenant colonel gerard leachman the british officer who had the reputation of being more arab than the arabs i finished long road to baghdad in 1990 in between i wrote articles and short stories for magazines worked as a teacher and management consultant and chased commercial markets when my agent sold my first crime book without trace published as katherine john in 1990 my editor asked what else have you written i produced long road to baghdad and the response marvellous love the characters love the plot but hate the setting no one wants to know about the first world war in mesopotamia set it in wales in the 1930s. problem – no arabs or very few no deserts sand in porthcawl doesn t count and no war in wales in the 1930s anyway i wrote a novel set in wales in the 1930s hearts of gold was meant to be a one off but readers and my publishers wanted more over the next 25 more books joined long road to baghdad in what my eldest son christened your great posthumous novels drawer one last summer a novel i wrote based on my east prussian born mother s wartime diaries joined it for 10 years until my present agent read the outline and sold it in a week i believe every book has its time and fortunately for long road to baghdad the centenary of the great war looms i m pleased to say that accent press is launching it as a paperback next month after living with my heroes especially the political officer who became more arab than the arabs and their ladies for so many years it s wonderful to see them and christopher marley in print christopher marley s death certificate was real he contracted cholera bleeding from every orifice feeling sorry for the overworked medics caring for him and hundreds of other he told them to plug me up so you don t have to clean the mess they did he died his body went to the morgue the sergeant in charge of the burial party didn t think he looked quite right they left him for the next by then he d come round i wish he was still alive so i could show him the book he inspired and the dedication this book is for the 97,000 and christopher marley who came back and lived to tell me about it. the long road to baghdad is published by accent press £7.99 the second in book in the series winds of eden is due out in august followed by scorpion sunset early next year catrin will be signing copies of her book in waterstones cardiff on march 1 from noon-2pm
