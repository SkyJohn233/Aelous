Koukkou E(1), Young P, Lowy C. >< Author information:  >(1)Department of Medicine St. Thomas' Hospital, UMDS, London, United Kingdom.< p> >< In this prospective study, we examined the effect of maternal glycemic control onfetal growth in pregnancies complicated by pregestational diabetes. One hundredand sixty-five pregestational diabetic pregnancies were studied with serialultrasound scans and fetal growth was examined as a function of maternal glycemiccontrol. There was a significant, although small, reduction in fetal biparietaldiameter growth rate in the presence of poor maternal glycemic control during thefirst half of the pregnancy. In the second half of pregnancy, maternalhyperglycemia contributed to fetal macrosomia. We conclude that in pregnancieswith pregestational diabetes, maternal hyperglycemia affects fetal growth in abiphasic manner. As a result of that, although babies born to diabetic mothersappear of relatively overall normal size and weight, they may have smaller heads than their potential and more fat. ><
