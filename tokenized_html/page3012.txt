musicianship and gave the album four out of five stars 31 the new zealand herald gave the album four out of four stars upon its 2009 release 36 noting that q-tip came up with something timeless then – and nine years on it sounds fresh inventive and cosmic and adding that the album has a unique coolness to it and it still sounds ahead of its time in 2009 36 however robert christgau named it dud of the month in his consumer guide for msn music in which he wrote that most of the tracks are musically incomplete and in the narrow sense of rhythm tracks the beats have some ass to them but as music they revert to fusion kitsch whenever the artiste sees an opening 32 pitchfork critic david drake commented that kamaal the abstract is not a great record by any means but it is an interesting one a unique effort by an artist struggling to mesh jazz and hip hop viewing that each track is a loose framework of unfulfilled promise 33 william grant of drowned in sound viewed that it seems a bit aimless at times but ultimately praised its diverse sound and gave it an eight out of 10 rating 37 dave heaton of popmatters commented that the album is mainly about feeling there s no storytelling meat to the songs less wit not much of q-tip s creative approach to language it s mostly about riding the groove and that q-tip does well 34 all tracks were produced by q-tip 24 credits for kamaal the
