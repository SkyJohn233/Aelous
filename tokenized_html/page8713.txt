absurdly thin but it packs in a gorgeous 13-inch retina display it s got a smaller frame than ever before but it s got the largest trackpad on any macbook even the keyboard is brand new after one year of living with apple s newest macbook air i remain convinced it s worth the high price tag xa0 the base-level macbook air now costs 1,099 before tax when i bought it in late 2018 it started at 1,199 apple has since dropped the price by 100 much to my chagrin if you add ram like i did it costs an extra 200 i felt pretty comfortable with the cpu and i refused to pay 200 for a measly 128 gb of extra internal storage but i relented on the ram upgrade i wanted this computer to last at least four years and 8 gb of ram simply would n't cut it i upgraded to 16 gb of ram and if i could 've added even more i probably would 've after tax i paid just shy of 1,450 remember last year this computer was 100 more expensive that was on the high end of what i was willing to pay for a new laptop but i 'm glad i did all that said the base-level macbook air is more than capable i got more ram because it fits my needs it 's entirely likely you do n't need to spend the extra cash it was n't until i handed my macbook air to a friend to use that i realized how impressive the updated screen is he was sitting next to me on a couch and i was talking to him from the side while he used the computer despite the fact that i was looking at the screen from the side no matter how thin i made the viewing angle i could see fine details on the screen it might sound ridiculous i realize yes i 'm saying that the screen is so impressive because i can see it from the side but the screen acts like a piece of paper instead of doing what screens normally do when you look at them from the side become a thin field of light with no discernible details the macbook air retina screen still manages to produce crisp details regardless of the viewing angle it 's something that does n't feel immediately impactful in reality it 's one of several crucial evolutions to the macbook air that make it feel so modern and fresh the slightly newer macbook airs that launched in july have an even better display thanks to the addition of apple 's true tone technology that matches the screen 's color temperature to your surroundings making it easier on the eyes no caveats necessary the updated keyboard is a major improvement over previous macbook air models there 's been a lot of back and forth over the latest version of apple 's long-running keyboard frankly speaking a lot of people do n't like it apple has even replaced the new keyboard in the latest macbook pro but in my experience the macbook air keyboard is a flawless update to the best keyboard ever made the shallow depth of each key enables me to type faster than ever before something i care deeply about as someone who spends the majority of his time typing words on a computer and i have n't run into any issues of crumbs/dust/etc getting lodged underneath keys one subtle nice change from the last version of apple 's laptop keyboard is how clicky the keys are it 's not so loud as to be obnoxious but it 's substantial enough to provide a solid tactile response do n't believe the hype the new keyboard is indeed a very good keyboard the trackpad and the speakers are both obvious improvements over previous macbook air models they do exactly what you think they do and they do it very well the speakers are loud and having one on each side of the keyboard is a really nice change in the case of the trackpad it 's larger than ever and as responsive as ever the major functional addition to the trackpad is a novelty named force touch that first appeared on apple 's iphones on the latest macbook air it remains just that a novelty by clicking in deeper than you normally would on a mouse click you get a few different contextual options depending on what you click it 's totally fine but i rarely find myself thinking to use it at the same time it does n't detract from the experience in any way in my experience with force touch it 's a relatively needless gimmick that i could take or leave force touch is entirely ignorable and i suggest you do exactly that passwords are super dumb they feel antiquated in the modern era like paper checks every time the new macbook asks me to enter my password and simultaneously offers touch id as an option instead i 'm delighted to quickly tap my finger on the touch id button it feels like the natural evolution of password entry curiously against all logic there are times when the macbook requires my password instead of my thumbprint i have no idea why my password is somehow more powerful than my own fingerprint and i kind of do n't care it appears completely illogical from a user standpoint thankfully the case far more often is that the laptop allows me to use my fingerprint to skip password entry and it feels smart every time my wife has an 11-inch macbook air from a few years ago it 's the same length as the 2018 13-inch macbook air sounds weird right i promise it 's reality apple shrunk the bezels in the new macbook air 's 13-inch screen so much that the same display fits into a far smaller laptop thus the overall footprint of the macbook air is that much smaller carrying it folded up feels like carrying a sturdy notepad it 's a genuinely small device despite the large screen everything about the macbook air feels tight and compact the laptop is dense no doubt a testament to the shrunken size at 1,099 to start the latest macbook air is n't cheap there are comparable windows-based laptops with great screens and more powerful internals than the macbook air and i could 've bought those i thought a lot about buying an hp x360 they 're quite nice but my workflow is based around the apple operating system macos and i 've been using apple laptops for over 10 years i 'm not buying a laptop to play games or to crunch 4k video edits i 'm buying it mostly for personal use and work i keep a lot of tabs open in chrome i 'm often listening to music in spotify and i regularly use adobe 's creative suite to edit images for me getting the new macbook air with additional ram is a perfect fit for how i use laptops but yes no doubt it was an overpriced choice worse apple dropped the price by 100 just half a year after i bought my laptop not cool apple still i have no regrets i 'm outright glad i waited so long to buy a laptop and then ended up with this one but i ca n't defend the price tag it 's still too high in my opinion by around 100 entry-level laptops should n't be so expensive chevron icon facebook icon twitter icon linkedin icon youtube icon instagram icon check mark icon
