Show More My gt-s6810p galaxy fame is somehow locked and I think is prompting for a password ***** some sort. Nothing was done to set a password. Resetting the device has no effect. It is my wifes phone and she said it was in her pocket in a pair of tight shorts. When she took it out of her pocket it was acting funny and she started pushing buttons! On the upper left hand corner there is a circle with a horizontal line thru it. There is a numerical keyboard and above it is a box prompting an input. I pushed and held the on button for 10 seconds and the phone restarted as per the manual. I also took out the battery and sim and replaced them and reset the phone again as above. I pushed and held the on button for 10 seconds as per the manual. Also I took out the battery and Sim and reinserted them and performed another reset as above. Have done that 3 times and the phone just shows emergency calls only key pad and remains locked No Tried dialling the numbers several times. Cannot dial symbols and the key pad just says try again. Great - done it. Everything seems to be working semi-normal. I was pressing the entire volume button on the left of the phone rather than the up-volume bit of the button. Thank you.
