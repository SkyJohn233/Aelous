The many roles of molecular chaperones and co-chaperones in tumour biology. Durech M(1), Vojtesek B, Muller P. >< Author information:  >(1)Regional Centre for Applied Molecular Oncology, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.< p> >< Molecular chaperones (heat-shock proteins, Hsps) are proteins that maintainintracellular homeostasis through folding and stabilisation of the conformationof other proteins. Molecular chaperones are critical for survival of cells thatundergo cellular stress due to their ability to guard the proteome againstmisfolded proteins and aggregation. In addition to their canonical role in basic cellular homeostasis and protection against external stress, several molecularchaperones play a fundamental role in malignant cell transformation. The level ofmolecular chaperones is increased in many solid tumours and haematologicalmalignancies. The increased activity of Hsps in cancer cells reflects the abilityof chaperones to compensate for stress caused by hypoxia, increased proteinturnover and the presence of numerous mutated and potentially unstable proteins. In addition, chaperones allow tumour cells to tolerate genetic alterations bystabilising tertiary structure of mutated unstable proteins - typicallyoncoproteins that would otherwise be lethal. From this perspective, chaperonesmediate the phenotypic expression of oncogenic mutations and contribute to allthe hallmarks of cancer cells. Due to their indispensable roles for cancer cells,chaperones became an attractive group of targets for novel cancer therapiesaffecting several essential oncogenic pathways simultaneously. ><
