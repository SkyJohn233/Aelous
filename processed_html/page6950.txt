STORYHIVE - Sick-A-Beat Project Page Drag Queens, dancers,  &  bright lights bring SICK-A-BEAT to life, as we watch LAVIVI  &  SHUGARBOY perform to a crowd SHUGARBOY  &  LAVIVI are a creative powerhouse together, pushing forward electronic music by adding their own creative spin.                             Sick-A-Beat is a debut collaboration between SHUGARBOY  &  LAVIVI, mixed and mastered by Monstercat Producer “Dillon Wong”.The song is about the experience of going out to the club and having fun, even though you might not feel like it. It's about always finding the music and letting it show you the way.                         My expertise in design, production, and marketing will allow me to spread STORYHIVE projects across the globe! I've watched LAVIVI  &  Shugarboy light up a venue with their music and creativity. There's never a dull moment with them and they are always supportive no matter the project they're working on. I believe that their work needs to be showcased on a global scale and I intend to do that with the Sick-a-Beat music video. Our talented team brings so much creativity and originality to the table. We are open to working with other like-minded individuals that want to create without limitations. Contact us for details.

We want to support our local talent to showcase them and help grow their fan base, and we think doing it together can only escalate them. We give hair  &  make-up students the opportunity to network with industry professionals and gain on set experience. By having such a diverse group of people be in the video, they will gain invaluable experience to be able to enter the entertainment business. By showcasing a local dance group, we will be able to support our talent in our neighbourhood. This will also give them an opportunity to network with new groups and gain experience on set Local fashion designers, LAVIVI  &  SHUGARBOY want to involve as much local talent with their work as possible, in music and fashion. By having them create the look for this video we are helping them create more opportunities like this for themselves and for others. SICK-A-BEAT was born at Tuck-IT: Amateur Drag Competition, where the song started and grew it’s support from the LGBTQ+ community. By including the LGBTQ+ community in the video we want to showcase the future we believe in - that we are all equal, gifted humans.
