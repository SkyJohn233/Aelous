USMT 5 and OneDrive for Business Migration Issue We are using SCCM Configuration Manager 2012 R2 with USMT 5 for refreshing the Windows 8 devices with our new 8.1 image. The One Drive for Business (ODFB) sync folder in the migrated user's folder is being correctly stored and replaced, but the sync status and settings of the ODFB application are not. After the refresh when the user launches ODFB they are asked to start syncing as if they had not already been doing so before the refresh. Problem: starting a sync results in a new sync folder being created and populated in their user folder, that duplicates the sync folder that was migrated over, taking up precious SSD space. The Win 8 being refreshed and the new Win 8.1 image both have the same version of the ODFB client that was installed as part of Office 2013 Pro Plus (with SP1 added). To be sure, I have even tried to refresh an already refreshed tablet to make sure the applications are exactly the same version.  Options we have discussed:  >1)Excluding the ODFB folder, by using a custom xml, but we don't have any experience with&nbsp;writing one or using it&nbsp;with SCCM OSD.&nbsp;It also seems like it would be&nbsp;challenging to write&nbsp;one as&nbsp;the folder is created as the user's name @ <em>blah.or< em>g and so it is unique on every device and account being migrated. 2)Finding the registry entries or config file that need to be migrated, but are not, for sync status and folder location. Haven't had any luck tracking these down. Any help or insight is appreciated! OK here's my custom xml file, you will obviously have to remove most of my custom includes and excludes. < migration urlid= " http://www.microsoft.com/migration/1.0/migxmlext/test " > ><br > < !-- Migrates all files in custom Program Files folders -- > >&lt;component context=&quot;UserANDSystem&quot;

I might be able to help you with a custom.xml file to exclude the folders. I'm using one in my environment both manually and with SCCM 2012 R2 OSD. I'm at home presently but can provide the general syntax for you to leverage off tomorrow including the steps to change in your OSD. I'm using USMT hard linking with my OSD however I'm sure you can adapt what I have in my TS to suit your own circumstances.

Can I make the custom.xml with only the exclude portion (with the idea that USMT includes everything that it is already doing in the default setup), or is it the case that if I go this route that I have to specify out manually in the custom.xml everything to include? I guess what I don't understand is if by specifying a custom.xml that this totally replaces the instructions for the user state capture or if it just  " appends "  these directions to the default includes/excludes. Please forgive my lack of understanding as this is brand new to me. No the custom.xml file is used in addition to the rest of the xml files as a rule set (so appends). So you can do both includes and excludes or just one. So in your case - yes you can just have the custom exclude section of my file. As I said though, you have to get the xml exactly right otherwise the exclude wont work. Just enable logging with your testing on scanstate.exe and loadstate.exe and you should eventually get there (/v with the highest verbosity level). There is quite a bit of documentation on how to use USMT with the various switches. Just grab it out the the latest ADK or look up the documentation on Technet. Cheers Damon Thanks for the help with the custom.xml setup. I wasn't sure exactly how/where to add the custom component for the exclude to the xml schema that is created when you do generate a custom.xml with the information included in migapp, miguser, and migdoc xml files. Since I didn't use the  " super "  custom file generated, my custom only has the component for excluding the folder,  I learned that I also then had to specify all four files in the task sequence on SCCM when going this route. At some point I plan on revisiting and testing adding the exclude to the all-inclusive custom.xml so that I just need to remember to add that one file to add to the task sequence. Here is the custom.xml that we created and tested to be working: < migration urlid= " http://www.microsoft.com/migration/1.0/migxmlext/test " > >&lt;!-- This component forces exclusion of SkyDrive OneDrive Sync Folders -- > >&nbsp;&lt;component type=&quot;Documents&quot; context=&quot;User&quot;&gt;<br > < displayName > Exclude OneDrive-Skydrive Folders From Migrating To New Computer < /displayName > >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;role role=&quot;Data&quot;&gt;<br > < rules > >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;unconditionalExclude&gt;<br > < objectSet > >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;pattern type=&quot;File&quot;&gt;%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive*\* [*]&lt; pattern > >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;pattern type=&quot;File&quot;&gt;%USERPROFILE%\SkyDrive*\* [*]&lt; pattern > >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; objectSet > >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; unconditionalExclude > >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; rules > >&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; role > >&nbsp;&lt; component > >&nbsp;&lt; migration > I don't know why Microsoft left the Goove settings out of the Office 2013 migration settings in USMT 5.0, but this at least ensures the old sync folders are not included in the migration.
