mom-approved toddler shoes working in the shoe business it should come as no surprise that i have a shoe-loving child it is a common sight to see my 2-year-old clomping around the house in too-big shoes or playing dress-up with random shoes from her closet who can blame her every girl loves her shoes like many new moms i had no idea what type of toddler shoes to buy my daughter at first when does she even need to start wearing shoes i tried a few cutesy shoes before she could walk and those turned out to be more hassle than they were worth it was rare that both shoes remained on her feet for more than 2 seconds she was always kicking her feet out of them so i gave up on shoes until they were absolutely necessary when she started walking around a year old at that point i had more to consider do brand names matter at this point do i go with velcro or lace-up or a slip-on style after trying a number of different styles and brands i am now confident enough to share these tried-and-true toddler shoe recommendations i will concede that there is a time and place for lace-up shoes like when you need to enforce a double-knot tie to keep those suckers on but i prefer velcro for speed and convenience they are much easier to get on and off and they re also easier for toddlers to learn to put on independently yay for when that happens one of my favorite shoes of my daughter s were these pink and purple adidas sneakers the velcro closure is great and they looked so freaking cute with every outfit i would pair them not only with jeans and leggings but also with dresses and skirts too so back to one of my original questions concerning toddler shoes do brands really matter when they ll most likely only wear these shoes for 6 months tops well in my opinion yes and i m not just saying that because i work in the shoe business a wise friend once gave me some excellent advice years ago she told me there are two things you don t skimp on good bras and good shoes both protect important assets you want keep in tip-top condition so on that advice i will always buy brand-name athletic shoes for my family that brings me to my next shoe recommendation i love love nike shoes their quality is unparalleled and their styles are always up-to-date my 1 recommended toddler shoe is the nike flex trainer not only because they re incredibly cute but also because they re incredibly lightweight and flexible for active little feet and if you look very closely you ll notice one truly amazing feature that moms can really appreciate one side of the tongue is attached so that when your toddler is putting on her own shoes the tongue won t get pushed down into the shoe and will stay in place as she fastens the velcro genius i tell you
