This question already has an answer here: many masters in here. I just have some problem while installing software via terminal. for example, I want to install wine with the code  sudo apt-get install wine . But terminal said this:  anyone wants to help me ? great thanks for all of you masters. This question has been asked before and already has an answer. If those answers do not fully address your question, please  ask a new question . You have a broken package. Run  $ sudo aptitude -f install  to fix that first, and then go on to install  wine . Though, personally I prefer using  playonlinux , in automatically handles the wine version etc. for you and keeps apps in different wineprefixes, gets less messy that way. site design / logo   2019 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under  cc by-sa 4.0                             with  attribution required .                     rev 2019.11.29.35523
