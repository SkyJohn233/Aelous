Untitled Document Lawrence Veale demonstrating The Revealer About 20 years ago, I discovered The Revealer in the           building maintenance dept. of Watney's Brewery, Trowbridge. They used           it for locating pipes around pubs, etc. The architect also used it on           weekends to mark out the postholes of old archaeological sites. Of course,           I was extremely sceptical until they actually demonstrated the instrument.           I decided I had to have one, and set about tracking them down.            After much searching, I encountered the inventor Lawrence Veale's wife           in Kingskerswell, Devon. Lawrence had died a few years prior, and she           was about 85, not really too interested in marketing the product. I           purchased a Revealer from her, and started to practice.            Finding pipes was really easy, and as I was involved with building surveyors,           clerks of works, etc. it soon became a topic of conversation. A few           people asked me to find 'stuff' and I did. I 'dowsed' Stonehenge (lived           nearby) and was amazed at the power of the leylines, which were actually           in the air.            A number of people asked me if they could purchase a Revealer. I contacted           Mrs Veale again and she still had a few machines, so I bought them all           from her. She was particularly pleased that her husband's lifetime work           would be continued. She gave me all the drawings, plans etc. and her           blessing to carry on the Revealer.            A few years later, I moved to the USA, taking 3 or 4 Revealers with           me. I was in sales, and met a number of sales guys at a business meeting,           and the topic of dowsing came up. I showed them my Revealer and they           all wanted one, so I was quickly down to my last one. They guys were           persistant, and asked me to get more, which, of course I could not do.                      So, after much deliberation, my wife and I decided to make them. We           had the plans, and Lawrence Veale's secrets, thanks to his wife. So,           we purchased a lathe and started to make them.            Our greatest problem was the chrome plating, it was expensive and SLOW.                      Still, we made a number of Revealers and sold them through these sales           guys. I remember Virginia as being the best area, my late friend Ian           Wallace really did well there. You may trip over one or two there.            All this happened about 15-20 years ago, and when we sold the last few,           we didn't make any more. We had bigger fish to fry, and our marketing           guys had dissapeared from our lives.            Recently, my wife and I retired, and we got to talking about the fun           we had using, making and selling Revealers. We realised that now we           had the Internet to market these items and it would be a completely           different deal. We could make videos, produce CDs, and we haven't got           anything else to do!!!!!! It'll keep us out of mischief for ages!!!                      So, that is why I am here. We purchased a new lathe last week, and will           start production in about 1 month. We don't even have a problem with           the Chrome Plating, as I own www.caswellplating.com  Mike Caswell Here is an original Revealer, complete in it's carrying           case. This item was recently sold on Ebay . Here are the two sections of a wand. Note the discs are numbered, 2,           4, 6, 9 and 15, denoting pipe diameters. Note the black stripe on the lower section, this is used for determining           pipe depth.
