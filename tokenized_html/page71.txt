florida studio theatre jerry sterner 's 1988 comic drama other people 's money\ has the feel of vintage clothing that harkens back to times past does n't quite fit in with today 's styles but still has something to say first seen in sarasota in a vibrant production at asolo repertory theatre in 1991 other people 's money\ initially served as a warning about the dangers of regulations that allowed businessmen to take over and destroy fading but still operating companies and eliminate jobs along the way all in the name of profit but the message is a bit muted in the new production staged by jason cannon times have changed and the story does n't have the punch it once did partly because the whole nature of the business world and our exposure to its darkest insides has changed plot aspects do n't seem as shocking as they once were it 's good to be reminded that there are still honorable businessmen like andrew jorgenson who is trying to hold on to his new england wire and cable company against the takeover attempts by wall street businessman lawrence garfinkle he 's known as larry the liquidator because of the way he buys stock in companies that he believes are worth more dead than alive he makes his money by getting them at a low price and profiting on the sale of the parts regardless of how many jobs are lost along the way nearly 30 years ago the play built to a pitched battle between two contrasting attitudes about the future of the business while some of us may still dream of the more noble goals of jorgenson there 's really not much of a debate these days that 's due in large part to the lively performance of sam mossler as larry from the moment he first shows up at the rhode island factory you know that larry is in charge of everything that 's about to happen and the company has little chance of deflecting his advances mossler exudes strength power and confidence and you never doubt that he will do what he says and in a perverse way you want him to succeed his opponents more low-key and quaint in style are n't up for the battle colin lane plays jorgenson as someone who should have retired some time ago because he has n't kept up with the modern ways of the corporate world he 's human which makes him passe he is aided by perry gaffney as his loyal assistant bea who will do anything to support the man she has loved since joining the company nearly 40 years ago even if it meant ignoring her own husband bea calls on her daughter kate a high-powered corporate attorney to help defend the company kate is reluctant for a variety of personal reasons that do n't amount to much in the play but she does get turned on by the mind and power games as she faces off against garfinkle while there is supposed to be heat between larry and kate you do n't feel the physical chemistry between mossler and nehassaiu degannes who exudes her own confidence as kate frequent fst actor joe ditmyer rounds out the cast as bill coles the president of the company who is divided between his loyalty to andrew and his own self-interests cannon and the cast mostly keep the story flowing across isabel and moriah curley-clay 's set which uses one space to depict two distinctly different offices susan angermann 's costumes fit the period and micheal foster 's lighting keeps the focus where it needs to be sterner 's script still contains some funny lines though we react to many of them differently larry admits to being a sexist uncaring pig and it 's harder to laugh that off in the era of the metoo movement you almost expect to read news stories in the future about his past offensive actions against women mossler does n't so much draw you in he grabs you by the throat as a man you love to hate or hate to love the kind of prominent
