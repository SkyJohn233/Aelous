Evaluate the use of metabolomics for the development of biomarkers of TBI for the diagnosis and timing of injury onset. A validated model of closed injury TBI was employed using 10 TBI mice and 8 sham operated controls. Quantitative LC–MS/MS metabolomic analysis was performed on the serum. Thirty-six (24.0 %) of 150 metabolites were altered with TBI. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) analyses revealed clear segregation between TBI versus control sera. The combination of methionine sulfoxide and the lipid PC aa C34:4 accurately diagnosed TBI, AUC (95 % CI) 0.85 (0.644–1.0). A combination of metabolite markers were highly accurate in distinguishing early (4 h post TBI) from late (24 h) TBI: AUC (95 % CI) 1.0 (1.0–1.0). Spermidine, which is known to have an antioxidant effect and which is known to be metabolically disrupted in TBI, was the most discriminating biomarker based on the variable importance ranking in projection (VIP) plot. Several important metabolic pathways were found to be disrupted including: pathways for arginine, proline, glutathione, cysteine, and sphingolipid metabolism. Using serum metabolomic analysis we were able to identify novel putative serum biomarkers of TBI. They were accurate for detecting and determining the timing of TBI. In addition, pathway analysis provided important insights into the biochemical mechanisms of brain injury. Potential clinical implications for diagnosis, timing, and monitoring brain injury are discussed.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex disorder that is highly significant due to its frequency, associated mortality and long term medical, financial and social consequences (Corso et al.  2006 ). Moreover, all demographic groups are at risk. Overall, rates in the USA are 579 cases per 100,000 persons, which corresponds to approximately 1.7 million cases each year (Faul et al.  2006 ). As a consequence of the steady decline in early deaths due to TBI (Faul et al.  2006 ; Langlois et al.  2004 ), disability resulting from TBI is an increasing concern. Longitudinal data estimates suggest that approximately 3.17 million people in the USA fall into this category (Zaloshnja et al.  2008 ). The reported potential link between recurrent TBI and chronic traumatic encephalopathy in professional football players (Omalu et al.  2005 ) has led to an unparalleled level of coverage of TBI in the lay media. There has been a long standing interest in serum for biomarkers of TBI. The potential value of biomarkers is widely recognized as they can assist with the diagnosis, the elucidation of the mechanisms of brain injury following TBI, the monitoring of disease progression, the identification of complications, prognostication and new therapeutic options (Mondello and Hayes  2015 ). Metabolomics has been extensively used to discover biomarkers and to provide insight into the pathogenesis of complex brain disorders (Graham et al.  2013a ,  b ,  2014 ,  2016 ; Jove et al.  2014 ; Pan et al.  2016 ). We recently reported the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to identify brain biomarkers in a closed TBI mouse model (Bahado-Singh et al.  2016 ). In that study, we found evidence of profound disturbances in mitochondrial function, neurotransmitter excitation, and oxidative stress imbalance in TBI brains compared to the brains of control mice. While brain metabolite analysis provides important and direct information on the impact of TBI on the primary affected organ, it does have significant limitations. In the usual clinical context, direct access to brain tissue is severely limited. Some of the brain biomarkers we identified in our study are known to be measureable non-invasively using MRI. However, significant hurdles related to cost and access, largely preclude the frequent and repeated use of MRI for monitoring the average TBI patient. This is often the case with mild TBI which constitutes the overwhelming majority of cases. The damage in TBI is longitudinal and progressive after the initial trauma. Therefore, serial measurement of metabolite levels would be the preferred route to properly profile the ongoing damage, to monitor treatment response and to make an accurate prognosis. Herein lies the advantage of blood-based biomarkers, which can be repeatedly accessed at relatively low cost and effort. Indeed, this is why there is such wide, ongoing interest in identifying blood biomarkers for TBI (Neher et al.  2014 ). In this study we used LC–MS/MS based metabolomics to identify potential serum biomarkers for TBI. A well-standardized and previously reported TBI mouse closed head injury model of TBI (Flierl et al.  2009 ) was used. Serum from the animals used in a previous investigation was analyzed for this study (Bahado-Singh et al.  2016 ). Here, we report the results of our LC–MS/MS analysis whilst NMR based metabolomics was used in the prior study to investigate changes in post-mortem brain tissue. While there is some overlap, the two platforms identify substantially different metabolites (Psychogios et al.  2011 ). The technique of inducing TBI and the description of the preparation, monitoring and euthanizing of the animals were as previously reported (Bahado-Singh et al.  2016 ; Flierl et al.  2009 ). The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Colorado (IACUG), protocol number B-79612(01)1E. Following IAUAC approval, the mice were sacrificed using terminal anesthesia and exsanguination for euthanasia. Blood was obtained by cardiac puncture just prior to decapitation. Serum was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000× g  for 10 min at 4 °C and the serum was separated and stored at −80 °C. Targeted quantitative metabolomic analysis of the serum was performed by combining direct injection mass spectrometry with a reverse-phase LC–MS/MS kit (AbsoluteIDQ™ Kit; Biocrates Life Sciences, Austria) as we previously reported (Bahado-Singh et al.  2014 ). In combination with an ABI 4000 Q-Trap (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex) mass spectrometer it is possible to accurately identify and quantify up to 180 different endogenous metabolites. These metabolites include amino acids, acylcarnitines, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and sugars in the mouse serum (n = 2). Metabolite concentrations are expressed as μM. Metabolites that were found to be significantly different (p  <  0.05) between sham and TBI mice were analyzed using the pathway topology search tool in MetaboAnalyst (v 3.0) Xia et al. (  2009 ,  2012 ,  2015 ). The  Mus musculus  (mouse) library pathway was utilized. Fisher’s exact test was used for over-representation analysis and relative betweeness centrality was chosen for the pathway topology testing. A Holm corrected  p  value and false discovery rate p value  <  0.05 were used to identify pathways altered due to the TBI. Heatmaps were produced using the statistical analysis tool in MetaboAnalyst (v 3.0) Xia et al. ( 2009 ,  2012 ,  2015 ). The data were normalized to the median and range scaled. For the Heatmap analyses the distance measure was Euclidean and Ward’s cluster algorithm was used (Bahado et al.  2016 ). The TBI group sacrificed at 4 h (early) after trauma and those sacrificed at 24 h (late) were compared. The overall TBI (early + late) group was also compared to sham operated controls. Log transformation and Pareto scaling were used to normalize the data. Mean and SD of metabolite concentrations were compared between the groups. Principal component analysis (PCA), Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), a variable importance ranking in projection analysis (VIP) were performed using a subset of metabolites that had a p value  < 0.3 based on univariate comparisons. For the generated PLS-DA model, permutation testing was performed to determine the statistical likelihood that the observed separation is either due to chance or real differences between cases and controls. This was accomplished by randomly relabeling the data and by rerunning the PLS-DA analysis. Permutation testing with 2000 repetitions were performed to establish whether the observed discrimination between the groups was statistically significant (Wishart  2010 ; Xia et al.  2009 ). Only the top metabolites (n = 15), as displayed in the VIP plot were listed. For the comparison of each metabolite, the pvalues were calculated using a Mann–Whitney  U  test. p value  <  0.05 was considered statistically significant. Bonferroni corrected p value = 0.0003 was used for multiple testing correction. In addition the q-value or FDR was used to determine significance (p  <  0.05). Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the optimal metabolite combination for TBI prediction. Predictor variables used were limited to those with pvalue  < 0.3 based on univariate comparisons. Variable selection methods using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) (Tibshirani  1996 ) was used and stepwise variable selection in the logistic regression calculation was employed to optimize the model components (Hastie et al.  2009 ). A k-fold cross-validation (CV) technique was used to ensure that the logistic regression models were robust (Xia et al.  2013 ). In k-fold CV, the entire sample is randomly divided into k equal sized subsets. Of the k subsets, only one subset is used as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining (k − 1) subsets are used as training set to generate the model. The end result is a robust, optimal and parsimonious biomarker model. The predictive ability of the model is then tested independently on the validation group which was not used in model generation. The performance of the model over these rounds is then averaged. The five-fold cross-validation (CV) with LASSO was used to determine the final set of coefficients and variables to be included in the model. Inclusion in the model required that a given predictor be selected  > 4 times out of the 5 CV exercises. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC or AUC) and sensitivity and specificity values were also calculated (Xia et al.  2013 ). In the case of TBI prediction, it may be better to over predict. This translates to maximizing sensitivity providing the best results. So, both the threshold (or cutoff) values of the generated logistic regression model for maximized sensitivity and the best sum of sensitivity and specificity were considered.

timing or chronicity of TBI. Due to the small number of samples in the early versus late TBI categories, ROC analysis could not be performed with the logistic regression approach. Using the Biomarker Analysis module of the MetaboAnalyst Program Xia et al.(  2009 ,  2012 ,  2015 ), ROC analysis was performed with the PLS-DA model that was generated using the six most significantly different metabolites. The combination of six metabolites: methionine sulfoxide, C3, SM C18:O, SM C 18:1, methionine and proline, achieved complete accuracy for distinguishing early TBI (4 h) from late TBI (24 h) with an AUC (95 % CI) = 1.0 (1.0–1.0), supplementary Fig. 3. A p value = 0.007 of permutation testing (2000 repetitions) indicates that the observed separation was not due to chance.

Significant changes in the concentrations of thirty-six of a total of 150 (24.0 %) metabolites were observed after TBI. Correspondingly, there were statistically significant differences in a number of important metabolic pathways in the serum of TBI mice. These include arginine and proline metabolism, glutathione metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism. A combination of PC aa C34:4 and methionine sulfoxide was found to accurately distinguish TBI from sham operated mice with an AUC (95 % CI) = 0.85 (0.664–1.0). Furthermore, a combination of six metabolites: methionine sulfoxide, C3, SM C18:0, SM C18:1, methionine and proline accurately discriminated early from late TBI: AUC (95 % CI) 1.0 (1.0–1.0). These biomarkers could be very useful for ascertaining the timing of TBI. We previously reported significant differences in the brain of TBI mice as compared to sham controls (Bahado-Singh et al.  2016 ). In the brain extracts AMP, NAD+ , ADP and IMP were the most discriminating metabolites between TBI and sham controls while in serum spermidine, methionine sulfoxide, lysoPCaC20:3, C18:1 and proline were the most powerful predictors of TBI. Mitochondrial dysfunction appeared to be the principal feature of the alterations in brain tissue. Pathway analysis also confirmed the different effects of TBI on the brain metabolome versus the serum metabolome. In the brain, we noted that purine, alanine, glutathione, valine and tyrosine pathways were among the metabolic pathways that were most affected. This appeared to be in contrast to what was noted in the serum (Table  4 ) with glutathione being the only pathway that appeared to be altered in common between the two tissues. However, it is important to reemphasize that the use of two different metabolomics platforms i.e. NMR for brain tissue, LC–MS/MS for serum, with different metabolite detection capabilities and differing metabolite sensitivities may contribute significantly to the observed tissue/biofluid differences and limits our ability to draw definitive conclusions on this issue. There is obvious clinical utility in the identification and validation of serum metabolite markers for the detection of TBI. Currently, the majority of TBI cases, approximately 60 %, are thought to remain undiagnosed. Estimates suggest that this is as much as 60 % (Boswell et al.  2002 ). Failure to diagnose TBI is a particular risk for athletes particularly at high school, college and professional levels. These individuals are known to often deny or downplay concussive trauma in order to maintain playing time. A high frequency of failed diagnosis has also been described in the military. The heavy reliance on patient self-reporting to make the diagnosis is a particular challenge in the military when one takes into consideration the loss of consciousness and post-traumatic amnesia, which attend such trauma. The non-specificity and frequency of associated symptoms in the general military population such as depression and anxiety is a further confounder and heightens the need for objective markers for the diagnosis in the military and indeed among all TBI groups (Bass et al.  2012 ; Chapman and Diaz-Arrastia  2014 ). Given the risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy from repeated concussions (Stein et al.  2014 ), improving diagnostic capabilities becomes a critical issue. Metabolites could potentially make an important contribution to addressing this challenge. An additional finding of our study was that a combination of six serum metabolites, sensitively discriminated TBI based on the timing of the injury. While the number of cases was small, the signal was unusually strong and appears to be statistically quite significant. The timing of TBI may have clinical value in determining the original onset of trauma. This is particularly important among the elderly in nursing homes and for monitoring the progress of a patient’s brain injury and recovery. One practical benefit to monitoring injury progression and resolution could include for example the development of objective standards for determining the appropriate time of return to play for athletes who have suffered concussions. At present this remains an unresolved and a contentious issue. The Pathway analysis provided important insights into the cellular mechanisms of injury in TBI, especially from the perspective of events taking place in serum. The most significant changes appeared to occur in the arginine and proline metabolic pathway. Arginine decarboxylate (ADC) is a rate limiting enzyme in the decarboxylation of arginine to agmatine. Agmatine is a protective neurotransmitter and exogenous agmatine has a neuroprotective effect in animal models of neurotrauma. In spinal cord injury ADC facilitates the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factors. It also reduces neurodegeneration, and is said to accelerate neuronal recovery (Park et al.  2015 ). Elevated levels of arginine were noted at 24 h compared to 4 h (supplementary Table 1). Glutathione plays a well-recognized role in antioxidant defense mechanisms. We observed a significant alteration of glutathione metabolism in our study. Cysteine contributes to glutathione synthesis and increased production of glutathione is induced by increased cysteine levels. This is an important mechanism for the removal of excess cysteine ( www.hmdb.ca ). Oxidative stress has long been known to be partly responsible for the neuronal damage in TBI (Hall et al.  1993 ). Indeed biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidant levels have been found to correlate with trauma severity and also predict neurologic outcomes in humans (Wang et al.  2015 ). The abnormalities of cysteine and glutathione metabolism that we found are consistent with these prior reports. Methionine sulfoxide is another oxidative stress marker. This amino acid is a byproduct of methionine oxidation and can therefore be regarded as a biomarker of oxidative stress in vivo ( www.hmdb.ca ). We found that methionine sulfoxide was a good predictor of TBI. It was however significantly decreased in TBI versus control cases. Interestingly we also noted that the concentrations of methionine sulfoxide significantly increased over time after TBI perhaps reflecting increasing post-traumatic oxidative stress in the sub-acute phase of the injury. We also found a significant disturbance of sphingolipid metabolism. Neural membranes contain significant amounts of lipids, including sphingolipids and phospholipids. They are thought to be precursors of lipids involved in signal transduction. Sphingolipids play an important role in neural cell proliferation and apoptosis and are known to support oxidative stress involved in neurologic disorders such as in head and spinal injuries (Farooqui et al.  2007 ). Serum sphingolipids may, therefore contribute to oxidative damage in TBI or arise from oxidative damage from TBI (Altura et al.  2002 ). Serum spermidine levels were also significantly increased in TBI mice versus sham operated controls, Fig.  1 . Spermidine and spermine are cations that play an important role in maintaining DNA structure and function through their roles as immune modulators and antioxidants. TBI results in disruption of spermidine-spermine homeostasis leading to production of metabolites that cause ongoing post-traumatic injury (Zahedi et al.  2010 ). Overall, these findings further support the role of oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses in propagating and controlling respectively ongoing neuronal damage post brain trauma. In comparison with a previously reported investigation, conducted by our group (using the same animal cohort) which focused on the brain metabolome (Bahado-Singh et al.  2016 ), glutathione metabolism was the only pathway found to be significantly disturbed (p  <  0.05; fdr  <  0.05) in both brain and serum following TBI. Glutathione (GSH) is the predominant low molecular weight thiol in all animal cells (Wu et al.  2004 ). Following TBI it has been reported that the levels of GSH are elevated due to the increased activity of gamma-glutamylcysteine ethyl ester within the brain. It is hypothesized that the elevation in GSH concentrations act as a neuroprotectant against oxidative stress associated with TBI (Reed et al.  2009 ). The main limitation of our study was the small sample size used. As a result, there may not have been sufficient study power to identify significant changes in the concentrations of other biomarkers and to document significant alterations of other important metabolic pathways. In other words, we may be getting an unusually narrow view of the metabolic consequences of TBI. Further, changes due to TBI were only observed for two early time points representing acute injury. An important limitation which relates to comparison of the current serum and previously reported brain findings was previously mentioned (Bahado-Singh et al.  2016 ). In particular, the use of different metabolomic platforms limited our ability to more directly compare the results between the two studies. However, given the larger number of metabolites and potential biomarkers generated by LC–MS/MS we believe it was particularly important to evaluate this platform for serum analysis. Serum based metabolomics analysis of TBI mice yielded a number of potentially useful serum biomarkers for the detection or diagnosis of TBI. A number of metabolites with biological plausibility were found to be perturbed post-TBI. We were also able to time the onset of TBI based on the metabolite profile. Using a combination of biomarkers, we accurately discriminated early from late TBI. The potential clinical impact could include for example the development of biomarkers for serially assessing the progress and resolution of the brain damage. This could have useful implications for objective return to play standards for amateur and professional athletes. Overall, serum metabolomics provides important preliminary insights into the mechanism of neuronal injury in TBI. One important practical application of this could be the development of serum biomarkers for the diagnosis, monitoring and prognostication in TBI.
