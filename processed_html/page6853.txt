There are fastfood outlets inside  Harbour City , which connects the marco polo hotels. There are  McDonald ' s  around too. Maxims '  Mooncakes are the  " trusted "  and  " popular to give away "  brand of mooncakes in HK. However, our generation now tends to like  " new "  version of Mooncakes.... like Starbucks '  mooncakes, and ice-cream mooncakes... I recall Haagen Daz came out with some..... sounds weird, but it ' s popular ! I always buy Starbucks Mooncake for fun. B/c the original mooncakes are very high in fat, and sugar, no one ever finishes the boxes we have at home! Maxims, WingWah, Kee Wah, are all famous  " old name "  brands. thank you for the reply.
