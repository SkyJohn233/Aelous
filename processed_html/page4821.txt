Keto Blueberry Scones Recipe | All Day I Dream About Food Facebook facebook Instagram instagram Pinterest pinterest RSS rss Twitter twitter All the best low carb keto recipes for a healthy lifestyle August 23, 2017 Classic blueberry scones go low carb and gluten-free. They have the perfect dry crumbly scone consistency. The best sugar-free scones you ll ever make! This post is sponsored by Bob s Red Mill.  It goes almost without saying that I love baking. You are probably already well aware of this fact, as I make no secret of it. But the motivation behind my desire to get into the kitchen and mix up some delicious low carb treat isn t just my sizeable sweet tooth. In fact, I d say that a sweet tooth may be one of the least important factors in many people s urge to bake. While we all love the goodies that come out of the oven, it s often the very act of baking that is so gratifying. It is a form of creative expression, and one that I can lose myself in for hours. And once the creativity is complete, it s sharing the results with family and friends (and readers!) that make it meaningful. I love baking for others and I will use just about any excuse to do it. My friends know full well that if they invite me over, I will not come empty-handed. If they have a birthday coming up, I will happily make them a cake. And sometimes I will decide we are having people over simply so I have reason to execute a low carb cake recipe I ve been thinking about. I love having something warm out of the oven to hand my kids when they come home from school. I don t even really need an excuse; I will simply bake and then drop goodies on the doorsteps of a friend s house. Usually with a piece of it cut out for photos, because my readers need to see the inside of the glorious creation! While it may seem like it s selfless and altruistic, it isn t entirely. Baking for other people makes us feel good. My friends at  Bob s Red Mill  sent me an article all about the  psychology of baking  and so much of it describes me (and probably many of you) perfectly. Baking is my way of letting you know that you are important to me and that I care. And then Bob s challenged me to create a care package of baked goods for someone I care about. I had to give this some thought, because keto and low carb baked goods are often more fragile and contain more moisture than conventional goodies. So getting them to a far away friend intact and without spoiling means you have to pick something that s a little on the drier side. I ve done biscotti for people many times, but this time I went with scones. I ve been asked many a time if I have a classic low carb blueberry scone recipe and I really don t know why I didn t heretofore. I just like to get more creative, but sometimes it s good to get back to basics. So here is a truly delicious, classic, crumbly blueberry scone recipe made with Bob s almond flour and coconut flour. I defy you to tell that it s not made with flour and sugar! And there is a special someone who is going to get these scones. The first round had to go through my taste-testers (my husband and kids!) but there is another round coming which will be sent to a friend. A reader who has been most supportive and kind to me, who has her own health issues to contend with but who s been there for me regardless. She doesn t know she s getting them yet, so shhhhhhhh .that s all I will say about that! Classic blueberry scones go low carb and gluten-free. They have the perfect dry crumbly scone consistency. The best sugar-free scones you'll ever make! Many thanks to Bob s Red Mill for partnering with me to bring you this recipe.

Carolyn says August 23, 2017 at 9:22 am Yes, but they tend to bleed blue when you fold them in. Try tossing them with a few teaspoons of coconut flour to  dry them out  before folding them in. Nicole says September 26, 2017 at 9:18 am I did, but like other recipes where frozen fruit is used u need to toss them in a little flour to keep them ftom bleeding too much.  Turned out great! Julie says September 26, 2017 at 4:21 pm Thanks for the tip with the flour jodi says August 23, 2017 at 10:21 am Can you sub another fruit? Carolyn says August 23, 2017 at 11:34 am You bet! Missy says July 16, 2019 at 8:59 am I just used strawberries.  I actually made two batches one blueberry and one strawberry with left over fruit in the frig! Karen says August 23, 2017 at 11:20 am Perfect lazy-Sunday-morning-coffee-and-alone-time-with-the-hubs breakfast.  You come up with awesome recipes in which I, almost always, have all the ingredients to make. Right there.  In my pantry/fridge.  I, however, lack the genius to put them all together into something delish.  Thanks again! Carolyn says August 23, 2017 at 5:33 pm Hope you love them! MaryAnne Reisigl says February 3, 2018 at 4:33 pm Just put in the oven if the final baked product is as good as the dough, we are in for a yummy treat!! Regina says August 23, 2017 at 11:26 am I love the YouTube video! And,oooh, I want to try these! You ve convinced me to pick up blueberries on my next grocery run. Kelsey says August 23, 2017 at 11:36 am I can t wait to try these using Lily s chocolate chips! I don t mind blueberries, but they aren t my favorite (I m crazy, I know), thanks for this great recipe! Amy E says October 30, 2017 at 9:27 am Did you try it with the chocolate chips?! I was thinking the same thing and wondering how it would come out! Did you sub the same amount (3/4 cup)? Nicole says July 1, 2018 at 8:33 am I use 1/2 cup sugar free chocolate chips. 3/4 cup is a little too chocolatey for me. Yummy! Susan says August 23, 2017 at 7:39 pm Perfect!  Easy, scrumptious, husband declares this is a keeper. I adore your one bowl, one measuring cup recipes, Carolyn. Carolyn says August 23, 2017 at 7:47 pm Oh yay, glad you liked them. Chris Houck says August 23, 2017 at 8:25 pm I picked all my blueberries already and had to freeze my extra, so I ll be using those in this recipe.  It looks amazing, and I think I ll bake it very soon!  Yummm! Anna says August 23, 2017 at 11:22 pm I m keto dairy-free, is there anything I can use instead of the heavy cream? Love all your recipes by the way, been a long time loyal to your website. Carolyn says August 24, 2017 at 9:01 am Absolutely you could use coconut milk or almond milk. And thanks for being loyal! 🙂 Angela says August 12, 2018 at 8:38 am the canned sruff? Carolyn says August 12, 2018 at 10:57 am Yes. Kathy says August 24, 2017 at 6:55 am Can t wait to try these! I have been craving scones   the one thing I miss since going low carb! A tip that might work for these scones is to divide the dough in half and pat into circles.Then just cut into six (or eight) wedges each. Ritika says August 24, 2017 at 7:34 am Hi I tried these and my dough was a little wet . I was not able to cut them. Carolyn says August 24, 2017 at 8:59 am Then something went wrong. What almond flour did you use? What coconut flour? Shelley says August 24, 2017 at 7:43 am Any chance baking blend could be used in place of the almond and coconut flour?  If so, how much?  Thanks! Carolyn says August 24, 2017 at 9:02 am Probably although it s quite a bit more dry so you will need to add more liquid. Shelley says August 24, 2017 at 12:42 pm Thank you! Betsy Stokes says August 24, 2017 at 8:44 am Ok so it might be the time of the month, but this post made me cry! So sweet that something you love can bring joy and love to others. Reminds me why I bake! Carolyn says August 24, 2017 at 9:02 am Yes, that s why I love to bake too! gjeannieg says August 24, 2017 at 10:56 am These are delicious! We love scones, and I make them often. This recipe is the best recipe we have ever used, and we aren t even GF! Based on what I had available, I substituted half-and-half for the heavy cream, and frozen berries for the fresh. Fabulous! Thank you so much. Carolyn says August 25, 2017 at 7:05 am Oh my gosh, that is wonderful to hear. Thanks so much! Julie says August 24, 2017 at 1:15 pm Love these thank you but can you freeze them and how long would you keep them in the fridge please? Julie Carolyn says August 25, 2017 at 8:52 am Yes, they freeze well both baked and unbaked. If unbaked, let them thaw completely before baking. In the fridge they should last up to a week. Jan says August 24, 2017 at 2:59 pm Is there some alternative to using Swerve? Carolyn says August 25, 2017 at 8:21 am Sure, these should work with any sweetener you prefer. NR says August 24, 2017 at 11:15 pm This looks fab. I have a son with tree nut allergy   can you recommend a sub for almond flour? Thanks! Carolyn says August 25, 2017 at 8:19 am You can use sunflower seed flour but just FYI, it reacts with baking powder to turn a funny green sometimes. You can offset this reaction with a tablespoon of lemon juice. Billy says August 25, 2017 at 12:49 am AMAZING .. My husband (puckiest person on earth) loved them. My mom who doesn t eat blueberries ate 2 and loved them. Our family is 2.5 months in on a grain free life and this was the first thing I have found we all liked that was sweet! Q. I tried with pumpkin but it didn t come out very well. What should I substitute or cut when I add pumpkin pure? Thank you again  < 3 Carolyn says August 25, 2017 at 8:17 am I am so glad to hear it, Billy. I already have a pumpkin scone recipe here. One word of advice it your pumpkin puree is already really thick, you don t need to drain it on paper towels.  https://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/2013/08/pumpkin-scones-with-cinnamon-glaze-low-carb-and-gluten-free.html Julie says August 25, 2017 at 3:08 pm Thank you Judy says August 26, 2017 at 8:44 am Have you ever made orange sconeS? Carolyn says August 26, 2017 at 6:06 pm https://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/cranberry-orange-drop-scones-low-carb-and-gluten-free/ Evelyn Moore says August 26, 2017 at 8:56 am I made these today, added chopped walnuts  delish! Angelia says August 26, 2017 at 6:58 pm I ll add a tiny bit of cinnamon the next time I bake these! Jane says August 26, 2017 at 7:31 pm I made these last night amd I almost wish I didn t because they are so freaking delicious I want to eat all of them! Thank you for this wonderful recipe, it is a winner. Teresa Randall says August 27, 2017 at 9:40 am You said these are dry and crumbly but I prefer a little moist on the inside type scone.What can I do to get a moist scone? Reducing baking time or maybe buttermilk? Thank you! Love your recipes!! Carolyn says August 27, 2017 at 10:12 am Add some more cream. Maybe a tbsp or two? Your dough will be sticky so pat it out with wet hands. Teresa Randall says August 27, 2017 at 10:43 am Will Do, thank you so much for the reply! kapu says June 2, 2019 at 1:07 am These are another winner with the husband. Tammy F says August 27, 2017 at 1:26 pm I made these Scones this morning and they turned out the way they re supposed to, but while they were delicious, I could taste the coconut flour. Now, I m not a big coconut fan so I was wondering if there was a way to modify the recipe to include protein powder instead of coconut flour? Carolyn says August 28, 2017 at 7:51 am No, don t do protein powder, that would make them very cake-y. Do another 1/2 to 3/4 cup almond flour instead. Angie says March 19, 2018 at 2:03 pm I just made these today and I taste the coconut flour too, I am not a big fan of coconut flour but love almond flour.  I will try it next time with more almond flour. Stacy says August 27, 2017 at 8:02 pm Love this recipe!!!! My kids actually ate them and now my daughter wants them for breakfast!!! I was wondering though if you could put your cinnamon twist video up again, I really want to see how you do it and the video doesn t work. Thank you so much, Stacy Judith says August 28, 2017 at 9:07 am I have my scones in the oven, the dough was a horror!  It was so crumbly, nothing I could do would bring it together.  I even watched the video again to see how yours looked but nothing like it. I had to add an extra egg and more cream, finally it came together enough to barely form. What could have I done wrong?  I followed the instructions perfectly, that is until I added those extra ingredients. Carolyn says August 29, 2017 at 11:48 am Well you can see from most comments that this isn t usually the case. What brand of almond and coconut flour? And did you pack your flours? They shouldn t be packed into the cup, just lightly scooped. Also how big are your eggs? Jackie Byars says May 14, 2018 at 3:04 pm I had this problem, too.  Used Bob’s for both flours, large eggs. Cindy says August 28, 2017 at 10:36 am I only have about a cup of almond flour on hand.  Could I use THM baking blend?  Thanks! Carolyn says August 29, 2017 at 11:46 am I think I may have answered your question on Facebook? Since THM baking blend is drier, use what you have for almond flour and make up the rest with the blend. Add more cream if you need to. Catherine says August 28, 2017 at 8:43 pm So delicious! I was out of blueberries but had a ton of raspberries and made the scones with the raspberries ..so delicious thank you for the recipe Miranda says August 29, 2017 at 2:06 pm Made them with grapes. They are  lovely. I am gonna try other fruits as well. Carolyn says August 29, 2017 at 3:46 pm Wonderful! Christine says August 29, 2017 at 5:22 pm I made these with blueberries, almost exactly as the recipe. I had no heavy whipping cream so I subbed almond milk. They are freaking delicious! The second batch is in the oven right now   savoury instead of sweet. I left out the vanilla, swerve and blueberries. I added garlic and onion powders and shredded nacho cheese. It tasted great before baking, can t wait to taste them when done. Thanks for the great recipe! miranda says August 31, 2017 at 4:59 am Yeah! That sounds great, gonna try that in the weekend! Cindy says August 29, 2017 at 6:57 pm You did answer me!  Thank you!  Sorry for the duplicate question.  Can you tell I am eager to try these? 🙂 Carolyn says August 29, 2017 at 7:33 pm No worries at all, just wanted to make sure it was the same person! Beth says August 30, 2017 at 5:08 pm Wow, these are fabulous!  My scones are not nearly as pretty as yours, but so yummy!  Quick and easy to put make too. elizabeth slabe says September 7, 2017 at 9:34 pm Hi, How long can the scones be stored? And I am trying a new brand of almond flour called Oh Nuts which is very fine and seemed to work well but that said I am a relatively new Keto baker! I love  your recipes? Thanks Carolyn says September 8, 2017 at 8:45 am They are fine on the counter for a day or two and in the fridge for a week. And I think the Oh Nuts one is pretty good, although I haven t used it in years. Sue says September 9, 2017 at 3:33 pm Left out blueberries, added nuts!  So good! Sarah Giammarino says September 10, 2017 at 10:14 am These were wonderful! I enjoyed them every morning this week for breakfast. My mom, who is gluten intolerant, also loved them. Thank you for such a wonderfuland simple recipe! Dawn says September 18, 2017 at 4:07 pm I made these with honey as my sweetner and they came out delicious!! Carolyn says September 18, 2017 at 6:17 pm Glad to hear it! Laarni says March 7, 2018 at 8:06 pm Can I use honey?  If so, how much? Carolyn says March 7, 2018 at 8:44 pm No idea, I don t use it. Abby says September 20, 2017 at 6:54 am Since i went GF i never invested much time into looking up baking and oven related recipies and dont have the necessary equipment. I don t have a baking tray, i use a microwave/oven for baking which comes with a glass tray.. Do you think i can bake it off the glass tray (cause it doesnt heat ) or should i use a cake tray and make smaller batches? Also i don t have parchement paper or a silicon mat. Totally new to baking have minimal equipment and thrilled to see GF recipies! Carolyn says September 20, 2017 at 7:12 am I think you can probably use the glass tray. If you don t use parchment, you should grease the tray a bit. patty says September 28, 2017 at 10:08 pm I love your recipes!!  I appreciate all your hard work making them up.  I have a problem  with a lot of sugar replacement recipes that the swerve is too sweet.  Can I just cut down on the sweetener and it won t affect the outcome? Thank you so much!! Carolyn says September 29, 2017 at 7:44 am Absolutely, in most recipes it won t be a problem. In some, the Swerve provides structure, but for cake, muffins and scones, it s just for taste. Monica says October 4, 2017 at 7:04 am Ahhhh I forgot the baking powder and they are in the oven ?? this is what happens when u decide to bake at 4:30am before work  spur of the moment decision! Carolyn says October 4, 2017 at 7:21 am Don t worry too much. Thankfully scones are supposed to be dense and a bit harder. Now if you re like me, you once made a really awesome cake with no baking powder. It wasn t so awesome after all Nashla says October 8, 2017 at 2:17 pm Hi. I love this recipe! Have made it quite a few times. However, mine are not as together as yours. What I mean is that they are very crumbly when shaping and separating. Should I add more liquid? Thanks for all your great recipes! Carolyn says October 8, 2017 at 2:29 pm Could be a difference in the brands we use, so yes if it s super crumbly and you can t press it nicely into the rectangle, try a tbsp of water or cream. Ella says October 19, 2017 at 5:05 pm Caroline, what is the difference in texture between these and the cranberry drop scones? I would love to make one of them but not both:) Carolyn says October 20, 2017 at 8:08 am These are more firm, drier and crumbly more like traditional scones. Ella says October 20, 2017 at 9:52 am Thank you for clarifying . I will just have to make a half batch of both recipes and taste test 🙂 Carolyn says October 20, 2017 at 12:22 pm I d love to hear the results! Ella says October 21, 2017 at 6:48 am Definitely:) Ella says October 22, 2017 at 3:50 pm Well my sister and I tried both this recipe and the cranberry orange drop scone recipes , just with blueberries. I added a bit of lemon zest and juice to both. Both were very very similar but This one is definitely our winner 🙂 Carolyn says October 22, 2017 at 7:08 pm Good to know! 🙂 Hope says October 21, 2017 at 5:02 pm I love blueberry and lemon, so omitted vanilla and added the juice of half a lemon and zest of a whole lemon. So good! Incredible texture. I don t know how you do it, but please don t stop. 🙂 Ella says October 21, 2017 at 6:51 pm Carolyn, I know this is the thread about the lovely scone, but I thought I ask: would you ever consider creating a low carb version of the French Opera cake ?? If anybody could do it, it s you:) Carolyn says October 21, 2017 at 7:50 pm Opera cake! Yes, I ve had that a few times and I have a few saved in my Pinterest profile to maybe make. I will get thinking about that! Ella says October 21, 2017 at 8:41 pm You re the best!!!! And with the awesome talent you have I know you will find a way 🙂 Love , love all your recipes I had a chance to try so far and can t wait for all the future ones too;) Beth says October 25, 2017 at 1:20 pm Made these today YUM!!! Thank you so much this recipe is definitely a keeper! Vicky says November 26, 2017 at 11:35 am Do you have a similar recipe for maple scones?  I miss those. Vicky says November 26, 2017 at 11:36 am A recipe for maple scones please? Carolyn says November 26, 2017 at 2:32 pm I already have one. Simply use my search box and type maple scones and you will see it! Tracy says December 9, 2017 at 2:11 pm I made these and I have had to throw them away. They tasted very very bitter. Would anyone be able to advise why please  Tracy x Carolyn says December 9, 2017 at 3:05 pm What sweetener did you use? Tracy says December 9, 2017 at 4:58 pm Hi Caroline Total Sweet, Xylitol Tracy says December 9, 2017 at 5:08 pm And now I ve spelt your name wrong. Sorry. My afternoon isn t going too well hey 🙂 Your scones look amazing and the texture and the look of them are perfect. I followed your recipe to the letter, I really don t know what the bitter taste could be. Carolyn says December 9, 2017 at 6:41 pm I can t imagine xylitol would make it bitter. I really can t tell you at this point, I would have thought it would be the sweetener. Could have something been wrong with your almond flour, I wonder? Lisa says December 29, 2017 at 11:24 am I have everything but the heavy cream but I have some whole milk Full fat plain yogurt I need to use soon so it doesn’t spoil. Could I sub that for the cream??by the way these look amazing Carolyn says December 29, 2017 at 11:48 am yes, I think that would work. Donna Voets says December 29, 2017 at 12:55 pm These were easy and very tasty .I did not use blueberry I used lily’s choc chips instead ..I can’t wait for tea time I have been really enjoying your recipes  .and your book Martha Bruton says December 30, 2017 at 5:33 am I would LOVE to keep in contact and discover more of your fabulous recipes.  Please help.  How do I log in or whatever? Carolyn says December 30, 2017 at 8:57 am Sign up here!  http://madmimi.com/signups/107971/join Danielle R says January 17, 2018 at 9:21 pm I have these baking in my oven right now and HOLY COW, they smell amazing. Not sure if I can wait the last few minutes before grabbing one to taste. Yum! Catherine Dawson says January 20, 2018 at 12:48 pm Hi. I ve just made these using erythritol granulated sweetener. The after taste is disgustingly bitter. I m not sure if it s down to the sweetener or the baking powder. I used an ordinary one used for cakes etc. Any tips? The texture of the scones is lovely and they look delicious. Carolyn says January 20, 2018 at 12:50 pm What brand of sweetener did you use? Is it one with stevia? It might be that Catherine Dawson says January 21, 2018 at 4:21 pm Hi, it s this one: 100% Natural Erythritol 1 Kg | ZERO Calorie Sugar Replacement by NKD Living 100% Natural non-GMO erythritol. ZERO calories, ZERO active carbohydrates Crystal clean taste, 70% sweeteness of sugar, no bitter aftertaste like stevia. Perfect for Baking, cakes, meringues, Ice cream. Helps people trying to loose weight who have a sweet tooth. 0 GI, great for people who want to maintian stable blood sugar levels More Stomach friendly then xylitol, and safe for pets. Carolyn says January 21, 2018 at 5:07 pm Well the best I can say is that you  taste  erythritol differently  I am assuming it s the sweetener, not anything else but I could be wrong. Jen says January 20, 2018 at 10:40 pm Thanks so much for this recipe , they are delicious . I used 40 gms of stevia as that’s  the only sweetener I have . Cooked them outside in our Webber as it’s super hot here at the moment and they turned out fab 🙂 Carolyn says January 20, 2018 at 11:13 pm Wow, how did you cook them in a Weber??? Sheree says January 28, 2018 at 2:29 pm These are fabulous! The only change I made was to add the zest of one lemon. Batter was slightly dry so I just added a bit more cream and they turned out perfect. Tiree says January 30, 2018 at 2:06 pm Hey, I ve loved a lot of your recipes, and this sounds silly. Would it be possible to just exclude blueberries? I love plain scones with butter more than any other. 🙂 Carolyn says January 30, 2018 at 5:49 pm Sure, absolutely! Jane says February 23, 2018 at 3:00 am Hi Carolyn.  My partner is on the keto diet and can’t have blueberries! Can you suggest another ingredient please. Carolyn says February 23, 2018 at 6:54 am Well you can just leave them out or sub a handful of nuts. Or some keto chocolate chips. Celeste Avy says February 27, 2018 at 8:27 pm Amazing!!! I used Xylitol for sweetener.  It worked great! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.  I plan to make it with cranberries. Kerry says April 11, 2018 at 5:20 pm Could i reverse the almond flour to coconut flour? Carolyn says April 11, 2018 at 7:07 pm No, I am sorry. This recipe has been tested and works perfectly with the ratios I have used. Mima says April 13, 2018 at 1:10 pm I made these with frozen blueberries and cashew milk. My dairy free family loved them. Thank you for another delicious recipe. Jennifer Farley says April 30, 2018 at 1:21 pm Gotta try these! Blueberries make everything taste so fresh and bright. Taylor @ Food Faith Fitness says April 30, 2018 at 5:01 pm Obsessed with blueberry scones! These look BOMB! Suzy says May 1, 2018 at 6:59 am Love this low-carb option for scones! Perfect! Gerry Speirs says May 1, 2018 at 10:21 am I love my scones and these look A1!! Jennifer Blake says May 1, 2018 at 10:45 am Blueberries are my favorite! Perfect for a quick breakfast. Erin @ Dinners, Dishes, and Desserts says May 10, 2018 at 9:21 am So perfect, and great for Mother s Day! Jackie Byars says May 14, 2018 at 10:57 am I used a round silicone scone pan, with 8 divisions (on a baking sheet).  I baked them 25 minutes, which was not nearly long enough—after cooling tasted raw.  I baked them another 15 minutes. Still not enough.  Advice? Carolyn says May 14, 2018 at 12:22 pm My advice would be to actually follow the recipe and bake on a cookie sheet. It s very possible that the high sides of your pan had an affect. Also this is supposed to make 12 so if you made only 8, they would be substantially larger and therefore take much longer to cook. Kimberly says May 22, 2018 at 1:36 pm I would like to make these and sub pecans and maybe some maple extract. Do you have a recommendation on how much maple extract to use? Also I m wondering if I should leave out the vanilla or sub in equal amount for the vanilla? Carolyn says May 22, 2018 at 4:49 pm I ve already done that recipe before  🙂  https://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/maple-pecan-scones-low-carb-and-gluten-free/ Kimberly says May 26, 2018 at 12:58 am Thank you 🙂 Now comparing the two, this one looks better with both flours! allison says June 6, 2018 at 11:09 am We love all your scones and the blueberry are to die for!  Fabulous! Cat says June 18, 2018 at 12:07 pm Love these so much!  Perfect for the blueberries we picked Saturday morning. I had friends who don t follow keto or low carb diets eat them and they had no idea they were eating a traditional flour scone!  I certainly didn t rat myself out!  I should receive my chocolate chip molds today. Can t wait to make sugar free chocolate chips and make these again using those instead of blueberries (tho the blueberry version will be a frequent flyer since I now have 3 gallons of freshly picked organic blueberries residing in my freezer 🙂 Thanks for the perfect scone recipe!!!! Cat says June 24, 2018 at 6:44 am I made two batches of these scones this morning with the fresh blueberries we picked yesterday.  One batch I made strictly by the recipe.  The second batch I added 1/4 tsp almond extract and 1/4 to 1/2 cup sliced almonds along with the blueberries.  While I love the recipe as written, the addition of the almonds and almond extract took these wonderful scones to a hole different level!  Not I m thinking almond poppyseed scones 😍 Rebecca says July 2, 2018 at 7:14 pm If you don t have the swerve sweetener what can you use instead. Thanks! Carolyn says July 2, 2018 at 9:57 pm What sweetener would you prefer to use? Melanie says July 20, 2018 at 9:40 pm Thanks again for another great recipe!!! I am becoming addicted to your recipes! These turned out wonderful! I brushed with melted butter before putting them in the oven and they turned out beautiful and yummy! Margaret says July 25, 2018 at 8:16 am can I use stevia for the sweetener? Carolyn says July 25, 2018 at 10:26 am That should be fine. Shelly says September 30, 2018 at 6:17 pm Just pulled these out of the oven and can t wait to try them.  They re a little thin, but smell heavenly.  I used xylitol as my sweetener (which I prefer over Swerve) and added a little lemon zest.  I have some homemade strawberry rhubarb (SF) spread to top them with   I like ALL the fruit!  Thanks again for a winner (i know because i couldn t keep the raw dough out of my mouth).  The pumpkin scones are next on my list! Jamie Fisher says November 3, 2018 at 8:45 am First THANK YOU for helping me see that keto/low carb IS a sustainable way to eat. I am just trying to improve my health   no diabetes, celiac, etc   but I was starting to think that I would just have to  stay on my diet  for a while, then  blow it  for a treat  &  get back on the wagon. With your recipes I don t think I ll ever have to do that! These scones were delish! We slathered some kerigold on top omg! I will say that I had to make sort of rustic cookie shapes because my dough was too wet. Next time I ll weigh the dry ingredients to see if that makes a difference. I used Bob s almond flour  &  a store brand (fresh market) coconut flour, so that could be an issue. Carolyn says November 3, 2018 at 10:01 am Hi Jamie  so glad I am making a difference in your healthy living! It may indeed be the coconut flour here, it s really hard to say. But if it s wettish, then add another tbsp or two of either flour to firm it up. Julie Tutemlan says November 21, 2018 at 3:52 am As  a new diabetic I m over the moon excited to have stumbled across your site!!  It s now 1:00AM and I m still scrolling 🙂 May I just ask is there a way to lower the fat content in these recipes?   A lower fat dairy product rather than heavy cream? Thank you so much!   I ll be following you forever! Carolyn says November 21, 2018 at 8:54 am Try almond milk Theresa B. says December 3, 2018 at 4:30 pm I just made these today. Sooooo good. I will be making these again and again. Amanda says January 10, 2019 at 5:57 am I made these this morning and added a lemon glaze to die for!   Thank you!! Julie says February 6, 2019 at 2:43 pm Another winner, Carolyn! I recently found you on FB and EVERYTHING I have made so far has been a HUGE hit with my family. I made these scones today with frozen organic blueberries (thawed in microwave 2 min at 30% power).  My dough was wetter than in the recipe video due to using frozen berries but they still turned out perfectly and didn’t even need extra time to bake. I do recommend blotting the thawed berries with a paper towel right before folding them into the dough. This helps make the scones a nice marbled purple color rather than a solid Barney purple-ha! Carolyn says February 6, 2019 at 4:47 pm Yes, frozen blueberries do like to bleed everywhere! Shelley says February 7, 2019 at 11:03 am I made these with raspberries and they are sooo good!! Laureen says February 10, 2019 at 4:33 pm I just took my scones out of the oven they look very close to my mother’s scones in England when I was a child.  As soon as they cooled a little I ate one, delicious and somewhat reminiscent of my moms.  Thank you so much for your recipes Carolyn! Carolyn says February 10, 2019 at 7:37 pm I am so delighted to hear that! Rachel says February 10, 2019 at 11:49 pm I am so happy to have found this recipe!! I am type 1 diabetic so I try to eat lower carb meals in general, not to the extent of Ketp though. I love love scones and always feel guilty having them because of the carb count! These were so satisfying. However, I can t stand the taste of sweeteners in baking .I have tried so many and can alway taste it. So, I  just took out the sweetener and replaced it with 2 tbsps of regular sugar. It only adds a few grams of carbs to the overall carb count. I am not trying to achieve ketosis, so this worked for me and my dietary needs. Thank you for this recipe !!! Carolyn says February 11, 2019 at 7:25 am Glad that worked for you! Jahmila D says February 22, 2019 at 4:16 pm Thank you for this recipe! These scones are delicious!! I added almond shaves and orange extract. The sweetener I used was xylitol. I couldn’t separate/space the scones before placing it into the oven. Therefore I waited till it formed a bit (22 minutes) the use the knife to separate and baked for an additional 8-10 minutes. Of course I tagged you on my Instagram page. I love your blog!! Carolyn says February 23, 2019 at 9:06 am Xylitol keeps things like scones softer than erythritol does, so that s the issue there. Judith says March 29, 2019 at 8:09 pm I m eager to try these, but am wondering which version of Swerve you used granulated or powdered.  Thanks! Carolyn says March 30, 2019 at 8:58 am If I don t specify powdered, then it s the granulated. Kind of how they say  sugar  and  powdered sugar , if that makes sense. Judith says April 7, 2019 at 6:14 pm Thanks! Helpful in answering this specific recipe question but also for future reference! Jill Freeland says April 21, 2019 at 8:05 pm My daughter-in-law gave me this recipe after I raved about them at Easter Brunch this morning. I have usually found full carb scones to be rather dry and grainy, but these Keto Blueberry Scones were tender and moist. I am now hooked on your recipes! Carolyn says April 21, 2019 at 8:59 pm So glad to hear you liked them! Kapu says June 2, 2019 at 1:09 am Another perfect recipe Carolyn. I have yet to make a bad one. Janet Worthington says June 7, 2019 at 7:48 am I wonder if these can be made into a loaf tin? Marla says June 15, 2019 at 6:54 pm Mine are in the oven now!  They never come out as pretty as yours BUT they do taste good!  Thank you for your wonderful recipes.  Now if you could just make these recipes half the size so I don t have to make so many! LOL!  (P.S. I am lousy at cutting a recipe in half !)  :p Kim says June 16, 2019 at 10:57 pm Can I just use all almond flour? And if so how much more, I d it equivalent? Carolyn says June 17, 2019 at 7:50 am You have to triple the amount. Amla says June 17, 2019 at 11:40 pm Great recipe.. But Can i leave out the eggs and add more heavy cream? Carolyn says June 18, 2019 at 2:50 pm Sorry, it simply won t hold together if you do that. mark kurtz says August 6, 2019 at 6:44 pm Great recipe, I didn t have coconut flower so used more almond, dusted tops with cinnamon and they were great served with butter on top! Fawnjemison says August 26, 2019 at 8:37 am Hi Carolyn these look great as we just went blueberry picking I have a scone pan that I tried to use for some scones and they fell apart upon trying to pull them out do you have any suggestions or can I not use my beloved scone pan anymore for low carb baking . Thank You Fawnjemison Deborah says August 30, 2019 at 12:40 pm Why do you suppose my scones don t rise (double checked baking powder  amount)? The thickness they go in the oven is the same thickness they come out after baking.  They taste wonderful! Carolyn says August 30, 2019 at 1:17 pm Something as dry as these scones doesn t rise much. They should spread a bit and rise a tiny bit. Not sure what s happening if yours don t. Skatty says September 30, 2019 at 10:58 pm Made these for the first time this weekend   yum. It’s a rectangle shape really 10 x 8? They were very thin and the picture shows them much thicker I’m wondering if the size is a typo in the instructions. Carolyn says October 1, 2019 at 8:26 am Yes, those are really the measurements. It s how I do all of my scones and they are not too thin. Stefanie says October 3, 2019 at 11:23 am Thank you for this recipe! I am terrible at baking but these came out so well, not too thin or too crumbly, just delish. Carolyn says October 3, 2019 at 9:06 pm Glad to hear it! Teresa Therese Hickey says November 12, 2019 at 3:51 pm I don t love coconut flour texture, so replaced it adding an additional cup of almond flour and decreased the liquid by using 1 less egg (per google instructions lol) and it turned out really yummy.
