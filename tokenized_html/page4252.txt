the strait of gibraltar poses an effective barrier to host-specialised but not to host-generalised lineages of avian haemosporidia sciencedirect sciencedirect • a high diversity of haemosporidian parasite lineages was found on both sides of the strait of gibraltar higher parasite prevalence was found in northwestern africa than in northwestern iberia haemoproteus and leucocytozoon lineages were predominantly host-specialised and plasmodium lineages were host-generalised abundant generalist parasites were more likely to cross the strait than abundant specialist one of the major concerns with ongoing environmental global change is the ability of parasites to shift their distribution both geographically and across hosts and to increase in virulence to understand the structure diversity and connectivity of parasite communities across the mediterranean sea we used avian haemosporidian communities associated with forest birds of northwestern africa and northwestern iberia as a model system we characterised host specificity of lineages and tested whether host generalists are more likely to cross the biogeographic barrier imposed by the strait of gibraltar than host specialists we sampled 321 birds of 43 species in northwestern africa and 735 birds of 49 species in northwestern iberia using a pcr-based approach to amplify plasmodium haemoproteus and leucocytozoon parasites we retrieved 969 sequences representing 200 unique cytochrome-b lineages haemosporidians infected a significantly higher proportion of birds in northwestern africa 78.5 than in northwestern iberia 50.5 relative diversity of different haemosporidian genera did not differ between our study areas but plasmodium was overrepresented among individual infections in northwestern iberia haemoproteus and leucocytozoon lineages were predominantly host-specialised and plasmodium lineages were host-generalised the number of regions occupied by lineages was significantly associated with their host specificity and abundance these data are consistent with the positive abundance–occupancy relationship and patterns of host specificity among different haemosporidian genera observed in other studies

biodiversity is disruption of ecological communities hurrell and trenberth 2010 although most members of temperate communities are expected to react to gcc by shifting their ranges pole-wards or upslope in the mountains species differ in their tolerance to change dispersal abilities and other life history traits parmesan 2006 these differences result in reshuffling of ecological communities and changes of species realised niches which are determined by interactions with other community members the complexity of these interactions can lead to unexpected responses to gcc pimm 2009 of particular concern is the potential of pathogens to shift their distribution both geographically and across hosts and to increase in virulence due to gcc in fact there are several studies demonstrating the devastating consequences of invasive or emerging parasites on animal and plant populations daszak et al. 2000 anderson et al. 2004 smith et al. 2009 gcc is expected to especially impact pathogens employing arthropod vectors for transmission a number of studies have confirmed the importance of climate as a limiting factor in the distribution of many insect and tick vectors kovats et al. 2001 therefore changes in climatic patterns and in seasonal conditions may affect disease spread survival transmission rate and persistence in novel habitats patz and reisen 2001 harvell et al. 2002 de la roque et al. 2008 dukes et al. 2009 parasites capable of infecting multiple species – host generalists humphery-smith 1989 – are also expected to be more successful at establishing in novel host communities the mediterranean basin is one of the world s hotspots of biodiversity and is a priority for conservation myers et al. 2000 climate model projections suggest that this region might be especially vulnerable to gcc giorgi and lionello 2008 with a high risk of endemic species extinction malcolm et al. 2006 if gcc allows vector-transmitted pathogens to spread from the tropics into temperate latitudes the mediterranean could be significantly impacted furthermore when these pathogens are restricted to tropical areas their impact may be buffered by high species diversity but expansion to temperate less diverse regions may result in greater disease impact on individual host species pascual and bouma 2009 moreover most studies of infectious diseases have focused on human pathogen systems in which a single pathogen infects a single host species and have not considered multiple host species systems with multiple pathogens dobson 2009 birds have long been used as model systems to study infectious diseases atkinson et al. 1991 valkiūnas 2005 and can provide important data on pathogen ecology unfortunately very little is known about the dynamics of their parasites at the community level ricklefs et al. 2005 the iberian peninsula and northwestern africa nwa are located at the southwestern edge of the palearctic and share similar forest and scrubland bird communities covas and blondel 1998 nevertheless the avifauna exchange between the two regions appears to be restricted by the strait of gibraltar inhibiting the gene flow dietzen et al. 2008 garcía et al. 2008 valera et al. 2011 this lack of gene flow between nwa and iberia has also been observed in other vertebrates carranza et al. 2006 and invertebrates wahlberg and saccheri 2007 but not in dipteran insects esseghir et al. 1997 porretta et al. 2011 which are vectors of important human and wildlife blood parasites e.g. malaria avian haemosporidia are a diverse group of widespread abundant and readily sampled parasites that provide an excellent opportunity to study the ability of arthropod-mediated pathogens to move across the mediterranean sea rapidly increasing information about these parasites in public databases e.g. malavi bensch et al. 2009 may further facilitate our understanding of patterns of their dispersal here we compare the diversity of haemosporidia in the forest bird communities of nwa and northwestern iberia nwi fig 1 specifically we i describe the diversity of haemosporidians in iberia and africa ii compare haemosporidian community structure between the two areas and iii characterise host specificity in both parasite communities we further test what parasite characteristics genus host-specificity and abundance influence their ability to cross the mediterranean sea biogeographic barrier according to the abundance–occupancy hypothesis gaston 1996 gaston et al. 2000 a pervasive ecological phenomenon demonstrated in a large variety of organisms including avian haemosporidia jenkins and owens 2011 drovetski et al. 2014 clark and clegg 2015 we predict that host-generalists and abundant parasites will be more likely to cross the strait due to their ability to occupy larger geographical regions these data should also establish a baseline for future analysis of the impact of gcc on the dynamics of these communities and their host–parasite interactions fig 1 bird sampling regions and localities in the study nwi northwestern iberia nwa northwestern africa a total of 735 breeding or resident birds of 49 species were sampled in nwi and 321 birds of 43 species in nwa between 2009 and 2012 fig 1 supplementary table s1 these samples have already been used by drovetski et al 2014 for a wider study of the abundance–occupancy relationship aor in avian haemosporidia across nwa nwi western greater caucasus and transcaucasia in that study the authors found that the number of regions occupied by lineages was associated with their frequency suggesting the presence of aor in avian haemosporidia however that study focused on the host specificity of only the 13 most abundant and widespread lineages whose hosts occur throughout the western palearctic it did not conduct detailed analyses of the distribution and host specificity of less abundant lineages or compare communities across geographic areas which are the focus of the current study in both regions sites were selected in forest-dominated areas birds were captured using mist-nets ecotone gdynia poland each bird was ringed and when possible aged and sexed and released at the site of capture after a blood sample was taken blood samples were obtained by brachial venipuncture with a sterile needle blood was collected into a heparin-free capillary tube and immediately transferred into a vial with 96 ethanol samples were kept at room temperature until dna extraction scientific names of avian host species follow the clements checklist v. 6.9 clements et al. 2014 total dna was extracted from avian blood samples using the jetquick tissue dna spin kit genomed löhne germany according to the manufacturer s protocol the presence of haemosporidian parasites was detected by pcr amplification of a fragment of their mitochondrial mt dna cytochrome-b gene cyt-b we tested each sample with three pairs of primers all pairs amplified plasmodium haemoproteus and leucocytozoon parasites and used the same forward primer univf cayataytaagagaaytatggag sites 187–209 from the 5′ end of cyt-b and one of three different reverse primers univr1 gcattatatcwggatgwgntaatgg sites 715–739 univr2 araggagtarcatatctatcwac sites 745–768 or univr3 atagaaagmyaagaaataccattc sites 781–804 drovetski et al. 2014 the shortest of these pcr fragments was 505 bp univf univr1 and completely covered the 479 bp fragment of avian haemosporidian cyt-b sequence adopted as a standard for the malavi database bensch et al. 2009 each sample that was negative in the first specific primer pair pcr was repeated to ensure that it was truly negative for that particular primer pair samples were considered parasite-free when negative for all six pcrs pcr volume was 12.5 μl and contained 1x gotaq flexi buffer 2 mm mgcl 2 0.2 mm of each dntp 0.3 mm of each primer and 0.313 u of gotaq flexi dna polymerase promega madison wisconsin usa and 2 μl of dna extract the thermal profile for amplification with the different primer pairs was the same and started with 3 min of denaturation at 94 °c followed by 41 cycles at 94 °c for 30 s 52 °c for 30 s and 72 °c for 45 s ending with an elongation step at 72 °c for 10 min all pcr sets were accompanied by negative and positive controls to detect pcr success and possible contamination pcr products were purified using exosap united states biochemical corporation cleveland ohio usa according to the manufacturer s instructions and sequenced directly using an applied biosystems 3730xl dna analyser at the macrogen europe sequencing facility macrogen inc. netherlands pcr fragments were sequenced in both directions when positive for the univf-univr1 primer pair and only with univr2 or univr3 for their respective pairs to ensure complete coverage of the 505 bp region between primers univf and univr1 sequences were aligned using sequencher 5.0.1 http //www.genecodes.com and trimmed to 505 bp when a pcr amplified mixed infections they were phased employing several approaches described in detail by drovetski et al 2014 these approaches utilised unambiguous sequences from pcr s of the same individual with another primer pair s the relative height of peaks in a chromatogram and our reference library of unambiguously resolved unique haplotypes to ensure consistent phasing of lineages minimizing the number of novel haplotypes that are not represented in the reference library all novel haplotypes found only in multiple infections were double-checked in order to confirm that they were indeed new lineages and not misreads of the chromatograms or inconsistencies in lineage phasing unique haplotypes were identified from the individual sequences in dnasp 5.10.00 librado and rozas 2009 and compared with genbank sequences and the malavi database bensch et al. 2009 http //mbio-serv2.mbioekol.lu.se/malavi/ accessed 18 september 2014 in order to identify known parasite lineages and their geographic distribution all statistical tests were conducted in r 3.1.0 http //www.r-project.org/ to compare the relative diversity of the three haemosporidian genera and their contribution to the total number of observed infections between nwa and nwi we used g-tests likelihood ratio test package deducer fellows 2012 for this we built a contingency table 3 × 2 with the total number of lineages found per genus in each area and the total number of infections found per genus in each area respectively differences between nwa and nwi in the overall parasite prevalence prevalence of mixed infections average number of lineages per infected host and parasite diversity were assessed by building several generalised linear mixed models package lme4 http //cran.r-project.org/package=lme4 region nwa or nwi was used as an explanatory variable and host species as a random effect for parasite prevalence each bird was categorised as either infected or not infected and a model with a binomial distribution was built using the logit function a similar model was built for the prevalence of mixed infections using only infected individuals each bird was categorised as either carrying a mixed infection or a single infection to test whether the number of parasite lineages per bird differed between nwa and nwi we built a poisson model using the number of parasite lineages present in each infected bird as the dependent variable finally to assess whether there were differences in parasite richness between both areas we built a poisson model using the richness of parasite lineages per bird species as the dependent variable and number of infections as the offset host specificity of the parasites was compared among genera using g-tests each lineage occurring more than once was characterised into three categories species specific ss if it was found in a single host species family specific fs if it was found in multiple hosts species of the same family and generalist g if it was found in multiple host species of different families this was repeated using information from the malavi database with the difference that lineages occurring only once in our dataset but deposited to malavi by other researchers were also used in order to understand which parasite characteristics led to their ability to cross the strait of gibraltar we built a binomial model with a logit function using the number of regions occupied by the parasite lineage one or two as the dependent variable and parasite characteristics as explanatory variables the latter included host specialisation ss fs or g parasite genus plasmodium haemoproteus or leucocytozoon and parasite lineage sample size log transformed number of times each lineage was found – log n model building followed the information theoretical approach of burnham and anderson 2002 which compares the relative support of a suite of candidate models using akaike s information criterion aic candidate models were built using all variables and their possible interactions package mumin http //cran.r-project.org/package=mumin the model with the lowest aic was selected and the significance of its variables evaluated with anova package car http //cran.r-project.org/package=car malavi information was incorporated to characterise the host specificity of each parasite lineage as well as its occurrence across the strait of gibraltar lineages that occurred only once were excluded from this analysis all analyses were done with and without samples of migratory species but due to the lack of differences in the

survey of haemosporidian parasites in forest bird communities of southwestern continental palearctic although other studies have focused on iberian haemosporidia using molecular methods they have focused either on a restricted number of species or only on long-distance migrants bensch et al. 2004 marzal et al. 2008 martínez-de la puente et al. 2011 casanueva et al. 2012 ventim et al. 2012 we found an overall high number of haemosporidian lineages 200 more than half of these lineages 113 were recorded for the first time such a high diversity of parasites can only be compared as far as we are aware with 137 lineages 45 plasmodium and 92 haemoproteus identified in the survey of 4513 birds of 47 avian species from spain to sweden pérez-tris et al. 2007 the high diversity found in our study with a much smaller sample size can potentially be explained by three factors first we used new primers that were specifically designed to amplify as much known diversity of haemosporidians as possible drovetski et al. 2014 and allowed us to resolve multiple infections greatly increasing the number of parasite observations second relative to most western palearctic studies we sampled a high number of host species 64 in total most of which are resident ∼80 finally we sampled two different areas separated by a biogeographic barrier the mediterranean sea instead of a single continuous biogeographic area the poor knowledge of the north african haemosporidian community may have also contributed to the high proportion of new mtdna cyt-b lineages found in our study our data suggest that although the diversity of lineages among haemosporidian genera did not differ significantly between nwa and nwi the distribution of individual infections among haemosporidian genera differed significantly this difference in the relative proportion of plasmodium and haemoproteus between both areas could result from various factors differences in habitat and vector composition can lead to different haemosporidian abundance e.g. loiseau et al. 2012 okanga et al. 2013 and even the presence of small landscape features such as ponds and streams can have an important impact on lineage composition wood et al. 2007 however the fact that we sampled many locations with different relief features e.g. lakes streams different plant communities in both regions should minimise these differences another factor known to shape haemosporidian communities is altitude pérez-rodríguez et al. 2013 rooyen et al. 2013a galen and witt 2014 rooyen et al 2013a in particular found that higher altitudes were positively correlated to the prevalence of haemoproteus and negatively to that of plasmodium which seems to be the case in our study with sampling locations in nwi being located at lower altitudes and with a higher prevalence of plasmodium than in nwa however this pattern was demonstrated in an altitudinal gradient within the same geographic region and in the same host-species little is known at the community level over large geographic areas some studies suggest that avian haemosporidian communities are better predicted by their avian host communities than by geography scordato and kardish 2014 especially in haemoproteus parasites olsson-pons et al. 2015 the fact that we sampled similar bird communities which were found in high altitudes in nwa and low altitudes in nwi gives us greater confidence that our results represent differences between regions probably in vector composition rather than between different host compositions linked to different altitudes the overall higher haemosporidian prevalence in nwa is consistent with the inverse latitudinal trend found in other studies merino et al. 2008 this difference in prevalence was even more striking when the proportion of multiple infections is compared between our study areas in nwa the proportion of multiple infections 38.0 was more than twice that observed in nwi 18.2 the proportion of infected birds carrying multiple haemosporidian lineages varied greatly across species among species with n ⩾ 5 the cetti s warbler cettia cetti the black redstart phoenicurus ochruros and the eurasian wren troglodytes troglodytes had less than 1 of their infected individuals carrying multiple infections whereas in the great tit and the iberian magpie cyanopica cooki this proportion exceeded 70 only two recent studies of great tits found similarly high levels of multiple infections reaching 61 and 82 respectively rooyen et al. 2013a rooyen et al. 2013b in contrast an earlier study focused only on leucocytozoon infections jenkins and owens 2011 reported only 5 of blue and great tits harbor multiple infections of leucocytozoon we found 32 of blue and 40 of great tits to carry more than one leucocytozoon lineage another study reported 20 of infected blackcaps carry multiple parasite lineages pérez-tris and bensch 2005 whereas we found 48 of infected blackcaps carrying multiple lineages thus our results and some other recent studies suggest that multiple infections affect a much larger number of birds than had been assumed previously although challenging and demanding extra time and effort mixed infections deserve much more attention for they seem to be the rule rather than the exception studies of multiple infections can provide crucial information about host–parasite interactions and help to elucidate the dynamics of intra-host competition and the evolution of parasite virulence and transmission rigaud et al. 2010 the reason we had unusually high success in detecting multiple infections in our study is likely related to the use of alternate primers and to the use of several primer pairs drovetski et al. 2014 the use of multiple primer pairs was also essential for successful phasing of haplotypes in multiple infections host specificity of haemosporidian lineages differed significantly among genera with host specialists being predominant among haemoproteus and leucocytozoon but absent among plasmodium parasites this pattern of host specialisation across the three haemosporidian genera with haemoproteus being the most host specialised and plasmodium being the least host specialised is consistent with patterns discovered in several other studies ricklefs and fallon 2002 waldenstrom et al. 2002 beadell et al. 2004 hellgren et al. 2008 dimitrov et al. 2010 martínez-de la puente et al. 2011 drovetski et al. 2014 despite confirming with the general pattern of differences in host specificity across haemosporidian genera our data significantly changed existing knowledge about host specificity and distribution of some individual lineages for example plasmodium lineage lk6 h158 that previously was reported only from the lesser kestrel falco naumanni in spain ortego et al. 2007 ortego et al. 2008 and berthelot s pipit anthus berthelotii in canary and madeira archipelagoes illera et al. 2008 spurgin et al. 2012 parasitised six common passerine species from five different families in nwa african blue tit coal tit periparus ater cirl bunting emberiza cirlus crested lark galerida cristata moussier s redstart phoenicurus moussieri and sardinian warbler sylvia melanocephala we sampled four of these six species in nwi but failed to detect lk06 another two lineages of leucocytozoon tumer01 h139 and h236 and tumer02 h234 were previously detected only in blackbirds from the azores hellgren et al. 2011 but we found them in blackbirds from both nwa and nwi demonstrating that it is not endemic to azores these unexpected discoveries suggest many lineages may have very different distributions and host use patterns from those we identified to date there is a clear need for community-wide comparative studies the lack of such studies together with poor coverage of large portions of the globe are significantly inhibiting our understanding of haemosporidian life history and evolution results of our analysis suggest that the probability of crossing the biogeographic barrier imposed by the strait of gibraltar by haemosporidian parasites was associated with the degree of their host specialisation and abundance this result is consistent with the positive aor in which locally common species have large geographic ranges and locally rare species have small geographic ranges thus abundant haemosporidian parasites with large geographic ranges are more likely to cross biogeographic barriers and move between different host communities than less common parasites with restricted geographic ranges drovetski et al. 2014 it is also not surprising that host generalist parasites are more efficient at establishing in different host communities separated by geographic barriers in contrast host specialists can not colonise different areas unless their host species are abundant on both sides of the barrier the fact that some host species are not shared between iberia and north africa e.g. the iberian azure-winged magpie and the african/eurasian blue tit have very restricted gene-flow e.g. the coal tit and have different abundances on opposite sides e.g. the blackcap may explain why common specialist lineages were less likely to cross the strait of gibraltar this pattern of common host specialised parasites being less able to cross geographic barriers than less common generalist parasites has been found in single host species studies in iberia and in australia pérez-rodríguez et al. 2013 clark and clegg 2015 but had never been described in complex host communities the fact that parasite genus was not an important predictor of the ability of parasite lineages to occur in both study areas does not mean that all parasite genera are equally able to cross the strait of gibraltar but rather that this capacity is related to their host specificity instead of their ecology or life history patterns as we saw plasmodium parasites were in general less host-specific than haemoproteus and leucocytozoon and were thus more likely to pass the barrier this is in agreement with a recent study done by olsson-pons et al 2015 in which they found that while haemoproteus parasite communities were better predicted by host species composition plasmodium parasites were better predicted by geography showing an isolation by distance pattern the fact that plasmodium parasites have a wide range of hosts means that in theory if at least one of the host species is able to cross the geographic barrier so are the parasites assuming that the vectors are present in both regions this seems to be the case with the strait of gibraltar with host-generalist plasmodium lineages being able to cross and host-specialist haemoproteus being less likely to do so the fact that the strait of gibraltar does not pose a barrier to abundant and generalist haemosporidians means that if there is a change in vector distribution during gcc those parasites that reach north africa will most likely be able to cross to iberia however given the fact that a decrease in precipitation is expected to occur in north africa and southern europe giorgi and lionello 2008 gcc may create an arid barrier to insect vectors and their parasites and thus expand the effect of the strait of gibraltar clearly more studies are needed to better disentangle the complex effects of gcc on insect-mediated parasites we suggest that monitoring and modeling of possible haemosporidian impacts on host populations should focus on the abundant and widespread lineages to identify such lineages future studies should sample local host communities as broadly as possible include poorly surveyed geographic regions and efficiently share information with other researchers in the field through public databases such as malavi bensch et al. 2009 another urgent challenge is to include multiple infections in the analysis as they are likely to represent mixtures of the most abundant haplotypes many recent studies discarded host individuals with multiple infections from their analyses dimitrov et al. 2010 jenkins and owens 2011 belo et al. 2012 levin et al. 2013 despite their apparently high frequency in avian populations finally the incorporation of data on the distribution and abundance of dipteran vectors as well as their host specificity and haemosporidian lineage association will also help to elucidate the complex network of interactions among birds their haemosporidian parasites and insect vectors understanding of these networks will further improve our ability to forecast
