is there a studio version of pinocchio story my bad if this has been asked before but it s probably my favorite track on 808s and i d love a version where that chick screaming doesn t kill me on my headphones ðŸŒŠ kanye the next closest thing is maybe the version of heartless on vh1 storytellers which is one of his best performances of all time no the studio version would not have that amazing t-rex scream at 2:19 like with the live version 340k members 6.2k online sep 16 2009 cake day
