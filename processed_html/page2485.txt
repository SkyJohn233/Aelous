The critics slammed it, quite many players slammed it as well (albeit to a far smaller degree) and nearly two decades later, people like TeamFourStar have continued slamming it. It hasn ' t aged well and I can ' t fathom anyone who hasn ' t played it before buying and liking it.And I don ' t care. I have and will always think positively of this game - even though a lot of it is probably based on nostalgia (namely how SotE was one of the reasons I got interested in games to begin with). Yes, the Battle of Hoth mission is the best one (worth the current price tag of 5bux), but back in the day (up to the mid-2000s or  Read more radigram         Games:                     Reviews:        1     Pur nostalgia May 3, 2016 Verified owner Yes, this is one of the games I played almost 20 years ago. So, this comment will be a bit nostalgic, trough pink glasses. Anyway, yes, this game is old. Very old in todays viewpoint. It was one of the first real 3d games, with low polygon figures and quit low-resolution textures (think of games like the first Tomb Raider, Drakan and others). But the gameplay itself is totally worth it, especially if you have a joystick/gamepad. You can also play it with a mouse and/or keyboard, but in some levels, this doesn ' t work that great or can be frustrating. There are of couse some extras in the PC version:- this one has rendered/animated videos, unlike the N64 version, that had only static images- the graphics are crisp- fantastic music (the GOG version has music in 192 kbit/s Ogg Vorbis  Read more dutchbastard         Games:                     Reviews:        3     Red Leader May 3, 2016 This game was one of the first games I had running on a 3D accelerator back in 1997/1998, I believe it ran quite well on a Rendition 2100 chipset. The game itself isn ' t that special, except for the first part, where you get to fly a snowspeeder and take down AT AT ' s with a cable and hook just like in Empire Strikes Back. If you got 5 bucks to spare, it ' s worth it just for that part.  ForeverTangent         Games:                     Reviews:        1     Great, but a little fast. May 3, 2016 Verified owner This is one of my favorite games of all time.  In fact I adored the entire Shadows of the Empire hypermedia  event.  So if you like Star Wars you will probably enjoy this game.This release.   Everything seem fine for the moment, except one small thing.   This release of the game need CPU throttling [at least on my system].   Although, playing games in Turbo can be entertaining unto itself, it can be a little off putting if you don ' t know why it is happening.  NShep53         Games:                     Reviews:        2     Nostalgia Overload May 3, 2016 Verified owner Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire originally came out in the early days of the N64 on the 64. The first level was amazing and still is to this day. After that, people where divided. The controls for the N64 version were awful to be completely honest. But I still loved the game. I always knew there was a PC version, with better graphics and rendered cutscenes (opposed to the 2D static cutscenes from the original). Now, through the wonders of GOG, Shadows of the Empire is here, and it is the best it has ever been. The graphics look great, the rendered cutscenes make the game have a more cinematic feel and the controls are actually good on the PC! I love this game (one of my favorite Star Wars games) and if you give it a chance, I think you will enjoy it too.
