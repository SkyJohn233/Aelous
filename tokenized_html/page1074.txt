op 31 the effect of ethnicity on the performance of protein-creatinine ratio in the prediction of significant proteinuria in pregnancies at risk of or with established hypertension – an implementation audit and cost implications sciencedirect sciencedirect the replacement of 24-h urine collection by protein-creatinine ratio pcr as one of the diagnostic criteria for pre-eclampsia has been recently recommended however the literature is conflicting and there are concerns on the impact of demographic factors on the performance of pcr as a screening tool this was an implementation audit of the introduction of pcr in a london tertiary obstetric unit women with suspected pre-eclampsia n 476 were asked to complete a 24-h urine collection and an untimed urine sample for pcr calculation multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the independent predictors of significant proteinuria in a pregnant population ethnicity and pcr are the main predictors of 300 mg or more of proteinuria in a 24-h urine collection with a pcr cut-off of 30 mg/mmol 41.4 and 22.9 of black and non-black women respectively would have been incorrectly classified as non-proteinuric sensitivity of 100 is achieved at cut-offs of 8.67 and 20.56 mg/mmol for black and non-black women respectively applying these levels as a primary screening tool to inform for the need to perform a 24-h urine collection in 1000 women it would lead to a financial saving of £2587 in non-black and to a loss of £2905 black women respectively pcr has 100 sensitivity and is cost efficient in non-black pregnant women at a cut-off of 20.5 mg/mmol in the detection of more than 300 mg in a 24-h urine collection however in black pregnant populations the performance of pcr is both clinically and financially suboptimal download download high-res image 77kb download download full-size image download download high-res image 133kb download download full-size image elsevier we use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads by continuing you agree to the use of cookies copyright © 2019 elsevier b.v. or its licensors or contributors sciencedirect ® is a registered trademark of elsevier b.v
