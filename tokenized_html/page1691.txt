reserved all market data delayed 20 minutes article accuses group of forming an alliance of 'hate with evangelical christians to back president trump religion correspondent lauren green reports on 'special report like many christians in america i was befuddled by the incredibly caustic language used by the authors of a vatican-vetted article last month which characterized the relationship between evangelicals and catholics in the united states as an xa0 x201c ecumenism of hate x201d xa0 i remembered a different version of this phrase x201c ecumenism of hate x201d used by pope francis himself when he called the historic unity enjoyed by catholic protestant orthodox and evangelical christians an ecumenism of blood x201d he did so in light of persecution around the world which he has xa0 characterized as producing more martyrs today than at anytime in history xa0 i found it shocking and intolerant for the article x2019 s authors to misappropriate language first used to unite the church to cause division within it xa0 it reminded me of romans 14:10 xa0 x201c why do you pass judgement on your brother x201d the authors of the piece in the la xa0 cattolica civiltas also used xa0 words like xa0 x201c radicalization and xa0 even xa0 drew comparisons to isis xa0 they also said that evangelicals and conservative catholics were in pursuit of a theocratic state we are not of course xa0 we simply want to protect our religious liberties so we can continue to minister xa0 though i couldn t miss the irony that the article was published from within the vatican a theocratic state xa0 i can not imagine that the article x2019 s authors understand the beautiful relationship that catholics and evangelicals have had in the last thirty years in the united states xa0 together we have worked in pursuit of the fall of communism led a vast resurgence of pro-life sentiment in the united states and we have fought for religious liberty here and abroad our humanitarian collaboration has also saved millions of lives among the poor and persecuted xa0 rather than being offended i xa0 decided to try and make peace by writing pope francis xa0 the bible says in romans 12:18 xa0 x201c if possible so far as it depends on you live xa0 peaceably with all x201d xa0 letter to pope francis august 3 2017 your holiness i am writing to request a meeting between catholic and evangelical leaders from the united states at a place and time of your choosing though i x2019 m hoping we can meet quickly i speak for many evangelicals when i say that we have looked upon your appointment with great gratitude to god and with great optimism for the new spirit that you have brought to the catholic church your commitment to the poor and to pastoral ministry and your efforts to build bridges and to spread the doctrine of mercy around the world have been a light and hope to us all as you know more than most all of this has also come at a time of historic christian persecution in more places than perhaps at any time in christian history together catholics orthodox protestant and evangelical christians throughout the entire world have shared as you x2019 ve said x201c an ecumenism of blood x201d it x2019 s in this moment of ongoing persecution political division and global conflict that we have also witnessed efforts to divide catholics and evangelicals we think it would be of great benefit to sit together and to discuss these things then when we disagree we can do it within the context of friendship though i x2019 m sure we will find once again that we agree far more than we disagree and we can work together with diligence on those areas of agreement i have to confess what prompted this request were articles published in the xa0 la xa0 cattolica civilitas xa0 recently and in the xa0 new york times we feel like this conversation is an urgent one and i will bring a half dozen or so of our denominational heads and significantly influential evangelicals for our time together we would also like to use the time to meet with various other high level officials throughout the vatican to find ways in which we can cooperate on matters of great concern to us all especially as it relates to refugees the poor and the persecuted i might add that when god put it on my heart to write you directly i immediately reached out to a mutual friend of ours he has recounted to me the warm experiences that he x2019 s had with you and they are what prompted me to write you knowing that you would receive this letter in kindred spirits with all the respect in the world and with love for christ x2019 s church and every corner of it i x2019 ll earnestly await your reply sincerely rev johnnie moore this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or
