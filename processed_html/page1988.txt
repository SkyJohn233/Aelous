New EV Battery Trailer from ebuggy Leads to Cheaper EVs Published on  September 19th, 2012 |                 by Tina Casey September 19th, 2012  by  Tina Casey If electric vehicle batteries are the single most expensive obstacle to  making EVs more affordable , then one solution is to ditch the battery, right? Well, almost. A German company called  ebuggy  has come up with an EV battery trailer called ebuggy (what else?). The trailer arrangement enables car buyers to go for a relatively low-cost EV with a small, lightweight battery for local driving (where range is not an issue). To go on a long trip, all they have to do is stop by the local ebuggy station, hitch up a trailer with a much larger battery, and Bob s your uncle. Though driving around with a trailer is not everyone s cup of tea, between private owners, the commercial sector, and government/non-government organizations, there is probably plenty of market to support something like ebuggy. For that matter, the ebuggy concept is familiar territory to the millions of U.S. drivers who routinely hitch U-hauls, campers, boats, and bike trailers to their cars. As a one-off range extender, the trailer concept is pretty simple. It only takes a couple of minutes to hook up, which makes it at least as quick and convenient as going over to the local gas station and filling the tank for a long trip. For even longer trips, ebuggy envisions a network of relay stations where EV drivers can drop off a spent trailer and hitch up a fresh one, also within just a couple of minutes. That makes things a bit more complicated, but it wouldn t necessarily put a crimp on the market. In fact, the EV battery relay/exchange concept is already starting to take hold as an alternative to charging stations. The  EV battery company Better Place , for example, has been ramping up the introduction of a fully automated drive-through  experience,  where EV owners can switch out their spent batteries in a matter of minutes rather than waiting around for a recharge. In terms of EV design, the ebuggy concept offers a higher degree of leeway to EV manufacturers, which would be freed up to devote more talent on developing super lightweight, inexpensive EVs for local driving rather than having to accommodate larger, heavier batteries. The folks at ebuggy also point out that the trailer concept provides a two-for-one deal, by providing EV owners with both a short-range and a long-range option in one car. Another option would be to buy that tiny new  Emo from Tata  and rent a larger car for long-distance drives, but that could prove to be a lot more expensive than simply hooking up an EV battery trailer whenever you need it. That tight focus on affordability and flexibility is no accident, as ebuggy evidently has its eye on the personal mobility revolution under way in enormous new markets like China and India, as well as Western markets where consumers are thirsting for more economical options. If U.S. car manufacturers want to compete for those customers, they are not going up against a lone company called ebuggy. They will be butting heads with a full-scale public-private collaborative effort by Germany. That includes a grant from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology, along with the participation of companies  AERA GmbH Muhlhausen Germany ,  BVB INNOVATE GMBH Stuttgart, Germany , and  HB Technologies AG, Tubingen, Germany , as well as the  ISW Institute of the University of Stuttgart . Unfortunately, back here in the U.S., a certain presidential candidate continues to push the  I built this whole thing all by myself  fantasy, which certainly does no good for the U.S. business community  except, maybe, in your dreams.
