ranganath ph.d. and cameron s. carter m.d additional article information individuals with schizophrenia sz can encode item-specific information to support familiarity-based recognition but are disproportionately impaired encoding inter-item relationships relational encoding and recollecting information the relational and item-specific encoding rise paradigm has been used to disentangle these encoding and retrieval processes which may be dependent on specific medial temporal lobe mtl and prefrontal cortex pfc subregions functional imaging during rise task performance could help to specify dysfunctional neural circuits in sz that can be targeted for interventions to improve memory and functioning in the illness to use functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri to test the hypothesis that sz disproportionately affects mtl and pfc subregions during relational encoding and retrieval relative to item-specific memory processes imaging results from healthy comparison subjects hc will also be used to establish neural construct validity for rise this multi-site case-control cross-sectional fmri study was conducted at five cntracs sites the final sample included 52 clinically stable outpatients with sz and 57 demographically matched hc behavioral performance speed and accuracy d x02019 on item recognition and associative recognition tasks voxelwise statistical parametric maps for a priori mtl and pfc regions of interest roi testing activation differences between relational and item-specific memory during encoding and retrieval item recognition was disproportionately impaired in sz patients relative to controls following relational encoding the differential deficit was accompanied by reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dlpfc activation during relational encoding in sz relative to hc retrieval success hits x0003e misses was associated with hippocampal hi activation in hc during relational item recognition and associative recognition conditions and hi activation was specifically reduced in sz for recognition of relational but not item-specific information in this unique multi-site fmri study hc results supported rise construct validity by revealing expected memory effects in pfc and mtl subregions during encoding and retrieval comparison of sz and hc revealed disproportionate memory deficits in sz for relational versus item-specific information accompanied by regionally and functionally specific deficits in dlpfc and hi activation long-term memory ltm for episodic events can be facilitated by focusing on distinctive features of individual items i.e. item-specific encoding or by examining relationships between multiple items i.e. relational encoding these encoding processes are of scientific interest because they are mediated by distinct subregions in prefrontal cortex pfc 1 2 and they differentially impact representations formed in medial temporal lobe mtl 3 x02013 5 subregions given evidence that schizophrenia sz may disproportionately impact relational memory 6 x02013 10 an essential next step is to develop an efficient task to differentiate between relational and item-specific processing in individuals with psychiatric disorders the relational and item-specific encoding task rise was created through the cognitive neuroscience test reliability and clinical applications for schizophrenia cntracs consortium http //cntracs.ucdavis.edu the original paradigm developed in healthy undergraduates 2 was optimized to provide a valid and reliable measure of episodic ltm in sz 11 x02013 13 to dissociate specific encoding and retrieval processes and assist with identification of corresponding brain regions to facilitate translational research aimed at improving cognition and clinical and functional outcomes the rise validation study 12 found individuals with sz to be unimpaired using a sense of familiarity to retrieve information following item-specific encoding but markedly impaired using familiarity following relational encoding and when trying to recollect information regardless of encoding process work is underway with clinical high-risk and first-episode individuals to test whether relational encoding deficits represent a cognitive biomarker for psychosis however it is equally important to establish valid imaging biomarkers 14 of relational encoding deficits so that they can be used to identify candidate brain regions for treatment development and outcome assessment in the current study we adapted the rise for use in fmri data were obtained during memory encoding and retrieval in a large sample of hc and individuals with sz goals were to establish neural construct validity in hc by demonstrating functionally specific effects in pfc sub-regions during encoding and mtl sub-regions during retrieval and more importantly test the hypothesis that sz specifically impairs functioning of mtl and pfc sub-regions associated with relational memory but not with item-specific memory processes by performing the study at multiple sites with multiple scanners we will also establish whether fmri effects are sufficiently robust to survive increased variability associated with clinical trial settings complete details regarding cntracs recruitment and enrollment are found in henderson et al 15 briefly participants were recruited nearly equally across five sites table 1 supplementary materials university of california x02013 davis maryland psychiatric research center at the university of maryland rutgers university university of minnesota x02013 twin cities and washington university in st. louis data were obtained on 60 hc and 60 sz data were excluded for 2 patients with excess movement i.e. x0003e 0.37 mm of relative frame-to-frame movement 4 patients and 2 controls with below-chance performance and 2 patients and 1 control with image acquisition errors leaving a final sample of 57 hc and 52 people with sz groups were matched for age sex handedness parental education and estimated premorbid intelligence wtar 16 table 1 sz participants obtained fewer years of school than hc likely reflecting disruption caused by illness onset patients

second generation 4 first and second generation after complete description of the study written informed consent was obtained the study was irb approved at all participating research sites the design was identical to the original rise study 12 with the following exceptions stimuli were presented in pairs during both encoding conditions see below and the item recognition task did not include confidence ratings participants completed one encoding and two retrieval fmri runs during encoding figure 1a participants alternated between three item-specific x0201c is either object living x0201d

made a two-button response to indicate whether object pairs were x0201c unchanged x0201d i.e. had been studied in the same relational encoding trial or x0201c changed x0201d i.e. had been studied in different relational encoding trials trials were presented for 3 s each with a 0 x02013 10 s jittered iti for both recognition tasks participants successfully completed practice versions of the encoding and retrieval tasks prior to scanning during testing they were encouraged to respond as quickly and accurately as possible and guess if unsure total scanning duration was approximately 22 min images were acquired in a single session on either a siemens 3t timtrio with a 12-channel phased array head coil univ of california davis univ of minnesota washington univ a phillips 3t achieva scanner with an 8-channel head coil univ of maryland or a siemens allegra scanner with a circularly polarized cp transmit/receive head coil rutgers univ using a consistent protocol across sites pre-processing was accomplished with fmri expert analysis tool feat in the fmrib software library fsl version 4.1 www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl using standard procedures including fieldmap correction statistical analysis of subject-level fmri data was performed using a general linear model glm implemented in feat statistical analysis of group-level data was accomplished by entering parameter estimates from subject-level glm analyses into group-level one-sample and two-sample t-tests in feat for the one encoding relational minus item-specific two item recognition hits minus misses separately for item-specific and relational encoding and one associative recognition hits minus misses contrast of interest excluding any non-response trials because of site differences in scanner characteristics table 2 supplementary materials research site was added as a co-variate in the group-level glm designs at the group-level we first examined a priori regions in pfc and mtl cortices followed by exploratory whole brain analyses regional analysis goals were two-fold 1 to establish neural construct validity and 2 to identify group differences to achieve these goals voxelwise contrasts were performed within anatomically defined regions for the full sample i.e. across hc and sz anatomical rois for the pfc were identified for the relational minus item-specific encoding contrast with structural masks from the wfu_pickatlas maldjian et al. 2003 restricting the mask to activated voxels within left and right dlpfc brodmann areas ba 9 46 and 9/46 and vlpfc ba 44 45 and 47 mtl rois were identified for the hit minus miss contrast during item and associative recognition and structural masks from the harvard oxford atlas restricted these masks to activated voxels within left and right hi and phg using these functionally and anatomically defined pfc and mtl rois voxelwise one-sample t-tests identified activated voxel clusters separately for hc and sz next two-sample t-tests tested for between-group differences within the rois for all analyses resulting z gaussianized t statistic images were subjected to a voxelwise threshold of z x0003e 2.3 and a corrected cluster mass significance threshold of p x0003c 0.05 based on gaussian random field theory 17 as implemented in feat any effects outside these rois were explored using the fsl whole brain grey matter mask with the same thresholding and cluster-correction procedures pearson product moment correlations tested hypothesized relationships between fmri activation mean beta values in designated rois and

conditions were consistent across groups because our interest was in engagement of encoding processes rather than accuracy of frequently equivocal responses e.g. is an apple that is not on the tree

motivating the decision to include site as a covariate in group-level glm analyses contrasts of relational against item-specific encoding across the entire sz and hc sample revealed robust bilateral activation in vlpfc and dlpfc these regions were interrogated in voxelwise analyses to confirm reliable activation within-groups and test for between-group differences consistent with 2 and full-sample results regions in bilateral dlpfc and vlpfc figure 3a left panel showed increased activation during relational relative to item-specific encoding trials whole brain analysis supplementary

encoding was associated with significantly better associative recognition r 56 =.35 p x0003c .05 this right dlpfc region did not correlate with item recognition r 56 =.14 p=.30 however the difference

between relational versus item-specific encoding revealed pfc activation in the left hemisphere only figure 3a right panel as illustrated this activation was primarily in vlpfc extending into ventral portions of dlpfc whole-brain analysis supplementary materials table 3 revealed this left pfc cluster and a second cluster in parietal and occipital cortices correlational analyses revealed that greater vlpfc activity during relational encoding was associated with significantly lower associative recognition d 45 x02212 .46 p x0003c .005 no significant correlations were observed in dlpfc examination of clinical variables in table 1 did not reveal any significant correlations in dlpfc however higher right hemisphere vlpfc activity during item-specific encoding correlated with less severe disorganization r 46 x02212 .40 p x0003c .01 between-group contrast of relational minus item-specific encoding revealed suprathreshold clusters in dlpfc indicating reduced activation in sz relative to hc fig 3b no group differences were observed in the vlpfc whole brain analysis revealed additional group differences in right cerebellum supplementary materials table 4 analyses of activity differences between hits and misses during item recognition revealed bilateral suprathreshold activation in hi and phg in the full sample these regions were interrogated in further analyses described below left and right hi activation increased during item and associative recognition hits relative to misses but only for objects encoded on relational trials left panels figure 4a and 4b contrasts for item recognition success for objects encoded on item-specific trials revealed no suprathreshold mtl voxels whole brain analyses did not reveal any additional effects outside of hi for item or associative recognition following relational encoding however successful recognition following item-specific encoding revealed a significant cluster in left middle and superior frontal gyrus a second cluster in parietal and occipital cortices and a third cluster in right cuneus and precuneus supplementary materials table 5 patients showed increased left hi activation during successful item recognition following relational encoding and right hi activation during successful associative recognition figure 4a and 4b no hi activation was observed following item-specific encoding whole brain

a third cluster was observed in left cuneus and bilateral precuneus whole brain analysis of successful associative recognition did not reveal any additional activation whole brain analysis of item

relational encoding figure 4a bottom panel the associative recognition task did not reveal suprathreshold group differences in hi activation no group differences were seen in mtl regions during retrieval success for objects that had been encoded on item-specific trials exploratory whole brain analyses did not reveal any additional group differences previous research 11 x02013 13 established the rise as a valid and reliable behavioral measure of episodic memory capable of revealing differential deficits in relational encoding and recollection based retrieval associated with reduced functional capacity in sz the current study used functional neuroimaging to establish neural construct validity in hc and identify sub-regions within pfc and mtl memory systems responsible for specific memory deficits in sz healthy participants exhibited increased dlpfc and vlpfc activation during relational versus item-specific encoding dlpfc activity significantly correlated with associative recognition but not with item recognition performance x02013 consistent with research findings from an earlier version of the task 2 patterns of hi activation in hc during retrieval provided further evidence of neural construct validity hi activation increased during successful compared with unsuccessful item and associative recognition but only for items studied during relational encoding this finding is consistent with basic human and animal research demonstrating a specific role for the hi in relational memory see 3 4 18 19 for reviews between-group comparisons replicated previous behavioral findings 12 of disproportionate memory impairments in sz following relational versus item-specific encoding most importantly the fmri data showed that these memory deficits were linked to regionally-specific reductions in dlpfc activation during relational encoding and to functionally specific reductions in hi activation during successful recognition following relational encoding results in hc reflect important anatomical and functional dissociations within the pfc cognitive neuroscience research demonstrates that dlpfc ba 9 and 46 and vlpfc ba 44 45 and 47 20 21 support distinct cognitive control processes that facilitate encoding of different yet complementary aspects of a given item or event 1 vlpfc increases when one must activate or inhibit goal-relevant features of items or x0201c item-specific x0201d wm to support successful item recognition 22 in contrast dlpfc increases during processing of relationships amongst items that are active in memory which in turn promotes formation of representations that support retrieval of relational information and associative recognition 23 x02013 29 within the mtl several lines of evidence suggest that hi supports recollection and associative memory 4 5 30 possibly by binding item and context information 30 current results fit this model and substantiate rise fmri neural construct validity demonstrating that it can be used to dissociate pfc memory control and hi relational binding processes in healthy and clinical populations rather than solely attributing episodic memory deficits in sz to failed memory consolidation and retrieval in hi or to disrupted strategic memory control in the pfc current results suggest that distinct pfc and hi sub-regions and mnemonic processes may be disrupted patients were most impaired following relational encoding which demanded recruitment of dlpfc during encoding and hi during retrieval in contrast patients showed less prominent memory impairments when required to engage the vlpfc to encode item-specific information this richer and more integrated account of episodic memory in sz emphasizes the importance of dissociating discrete encoding and retrieval processes and may also help explain variability in the literature and arguments about presence or absence of recognition impairments and consistency of dlpfc and hi dysfunction based on these results we speculate that interventions to improve memory in patients might adopt a two-step approach the first is to increase compensatory recruitment of vlpfc through training in the use of item-specific semantic encoding strategies 31 however strategy training alone is unlikely to restore more persistent deficits in relational processing and recollection therefore we also suggest that training in relational processing possibly in combination with neurostimulation pharmacological or other mechanistic interventions could improve patients x02019 ability to recruit dlpfc and hi 31 although the most prominent sz impairments were observed during relational and associative memory it is important to note that patients showed a medium to large sized deficit in item recognition discriminability following item-specific encoding a similar magnitude deficit was observed in the original rise study 12 but use of confidence ratings in that study allowed us to separately estimate contributions of recollection and familiarity to recognition performance see 32 those analyses revealed two effects x02013 patients showed a global recollection impairment and a specific effect of relational encoding on familiarity-based recognition collectively we believe that these two effects can account for many observed memory deficits in sz thus it is likely that the current recognition discriminability deficit following item-specific encoding was due to patient difficulties in recollection rather than familiarity-based retrieval this can be tested in future fmri studies by including x0201c high x0201d x0201c medium x0201d and x0201c low x0201d confidence ratings during recognition testing which would allow use of dual process signal detection models dpsd 33 to obtain familiarity and recollection parameter estimates the study had other limitations worth noting because of the multi-site nature of the project the patient sample was quite heterogeneous however a potential benefit of this heterogeneity is that it increases generalizability of results to the larger population of individuals with schizophrenia and demonstrates that individuals with different demographic and clinical characteristics are capable of completing rise fmri in addition the majority of patients were medicated rise studies are underway with clinical high risk and first episode patients a number of which are un-medicated or never medicated which will allow investigation of medication and treatment effects finally the associative recognition task was less successful than the item recognition task in revealing significant group differences in hi activation following relational encoding we believe that this was because the task had half as many trials which reduced sensitivity to detect between-group differences future studies may therefore benefit from doubling associative recognition trials in summary this multi-site fmri study of episodic encoding and retrieval establishes the neural construct validity of the rise paradigm and suggests that it can successfully detect functionally and neuroanatomically specific deficits in relational memory processes and related dlpfc and hi function in people with sz across multiple sites employing different investigators and imaging environments similar to what would be encountered in a clinical trials setting this work was supported by
