Abdul Basit Usman, a militant with strong al-Qaeda links who was blamed for numerous bomb attacks in the southern Philippines, had been hunted by security forces since 2002. " There was in-fighting among his group, "  General Gregorio Pio Catapang told journalists at the main army base in Manila.  " Reports reaching this headquarters revealed that Usman and five of his unidentified cohorts were killed in a shoot-out allegedly with fellow members of his group. " Catapang said he had information that Usman's followers had turned on him because of a US$1 million bounty offered by the US State Department, without elaborating. But his account was contradicted by the country's largest Muslim rebel group - the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) - which said its fighters killed the renegade Usman. " We can confirm that Usman is dead, and his body was buried in accordance with Muslim tradition, "  MILF vice-chairman Ghazali Jaafar said. The MILF's chief peace negotiator, Mohagher Iqbal, said Usman was killed by its forces when he resisted arrest. In March last year, the Philippines signed a peace deal with the MILF ending about 45 years of conflict that has killed 120,000 people and displaced two million. But the rebels will not lay down weapons until after a final peace deal is reached. They are waiting for Manila to set up a new Muslim autonomous government in the south, granting wider powers over its economy, politics and social life. Catapang said Usman was travelling with seven bodyguards towards a rebel camp in Guindulungan town, on the southern island of Mindanao, when a firefight erupted within his group. " The bodies were discovered by Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels, "  he said, adding that the army and police units were trying to establish the identities of the slain militants. The MILF's chief peace negotiator, Mohagher Iqbal, said that Usman was killed by its forces when he resisted arrest. Usman's group was intercepted by rebel forces near a creek at around 10.30am on Sunday, but chose to shoot it out rather than be taken to the guerrilla's main camp, he said. Both Catapang and Iqbal said that Usman's death would be a boost to continuing peace efforts. " Our security operations will continue until we get all the potential spoilers to the peace process, "  Catapang said, adding there were still 10 foreign Islamist militants and about 100 local renegade Islamist militants in the south. Security forces had been hunting Usman, accused of repeated bomb attacks in the southern Philippines, since he escaped from a January police raid that killed Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir, an alleged bomb maker who was the subject of a US$5-million American government bounty. The January raid also led to the death of 44 police commandoes as rebels fought back, setting peace efforts. The MILF has since then been under pressure to show it is a reliable peace partner. The US State Department's website describes Usman as  " a bomb-making expert with links to the Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf Group terrorist organisations "  leading him to be considered a threat to American and Filipino citizens and interests.

Ten of the wounded, including three children, were civilians, while five were police officers, he added. “The attack is believed to be part of the Communist Party of the Philippines '  celebration of its founding anniversary on December 26,” Aragones said. “This just proves that they have no respect for human rights and the lives of innocent civilians,” he added. “They have no conscience.” The police officers were riding in a vehicle along the highway, when a huge explosion occurred followed by a volley of gunfire, said army major Patrick Martinez. Unfortunately, a tricycle packed with civilians got caught in the crossfire, leaving a 69-year-old grandmother dead, he added. “The loss of life and the violence experienced by the victims are reprehensible,” said Communications Secretary Martin Andanar.

During the raid, armed officers wearing masks burst into the room where the group was rehearsing for an upcoming performance commemorating the end of Spanish colonisation, raised their guns and ordered everyone to lie face down on the ground, said Joe Del Mar A. Tano II, a member of the group. “They made us drop and look down so we wouldn’t see what they were doing inside the office,” said the 18-year-old, who added that he “was kicked by a policeman in the back” when he tried to look up after hearing some younger members of the group crying. The police carried out a search, emerging about 30 minutes later with a cache of firearms and explosives they said they had found in the offices Teatro Obrero were using as a practice space, leaving Tano and his fellow performers “shocked, because we don’t have firearms in our offices,” he said. As they were lined up and arrested, officers bound their wrists tightly with cable ties which – for the men at least – were not removed until after their first night in police custody, Tano said. There were 25 members of Teatro Obrero arrested that day, 13 of whom were minors. Those under 18 were mostly released by November 4 – the same day that the 12 adults were charged with illegal possession of firearms and explosives. Charges against 11 of them were dropped upon their release on November 6, but at the time of publication, one member of the group remained in custody.

Military personnel would also demand that they confess to being communist rebels “every time we went to the [toilet],” the 22-year-old said. Other members recalled being forced to dance for policemen who “mocked them” and “kept on laughing”, said Zara Alvarez of the rights group Defend Negros which worked to secure the performers’ release. “They never tortured us physically, but they tortured us mentally and emotionally,” said Junelle Miraflor, a 37-year-old who helps choreograph the group’s performances. The October 31 raids in Bacolod, the provincial capital of Negros Occidental and a long-time hub for local organisations advocating for land and labour rights, were described by an army public affairs chief on November 2 as “a product of thorough intelligence operations”. They were part of a series of counter-insurgency raids carried out on the central island of Negros that led to the arrests of 57 people – 13 of whom were under 18 – including members of Bayan Muna, militant trade unionist group Kilusang Mayo Uno, leftist women’s political advocacy organisation Gabriela Women’s Party and the National Federation of Sugar Workers, as well as 21 former workers for a regional bus company who had been laid off. Of those detained in the raids, seven remain in custody, four were released on bail and the rest were released after the charges against them were dropped. Earlier joint police and military operations in Negros, in December 2018 and March 2019, led to the deaths of 20 farmers and community leaders after Duterte issued an order giving the military sweeping authority to engage in counter-insurgency operations. In a statement on November 5, the Philippines Commission on Human Rights said it had dispatched a team to “investigate and closely monitor” whether the raids in Bacolod were “intended to silence or curtail legitimate dissent”. The arrests underscore a heightened sense of fear and paranoia in Negros, where activists regularly report receiving anonymous threats, being followed by unidentified men and subjected to police or military “visits”. A number of Teatro Obrero members said their families continue to receive such “visits” and that they are afraid of returning home – a tactic that Clarizza Singson, chair of the Negros chapter of Philippine rights group Karapatan, described as a possible attempt to “force them to testify” against other detainees.

They left the two behind because they could not drag them any more. They scampered in different directions but our troops are in pursuit,” Sobejana said. The Hyrons were not hurt in the 10-minute firefight, the military said, adding that no ransom was paid to the Abu Sayyaf militants. A picture released by the military showed the couple smiling in a military camp and talking with generals and other army officers in Sulu. Sobejana said the couple will undergo a medical check-up and will be interviewed by military officials.

Troops killed a “high-value” but little-known Abu Sayyaf commander, Talha Jumsah, on Friday near Sulu’s mountainous Patikul town. Jumsah acted as a key link between Isis and local jihadists and helped set up a series of deadly suicide attacks in Sulu this year. Troops killed five Abu Sayyaf militants, including two commanders, on Sunday in a separate clash in Sulu. One of the slain commanders, Sibih Pish, had been blamed for past ransom kidnappings. Abu Sayyaf emerged in the late 1980s as an offshoot of the decades-long Muslim separatist insurgency in the south of the largely Roman Catholic nation. After losing its commanders early in battle, Abu Sayyaf rapidly degenerated into a small but brutal group blamed for ransom kidnappings, beheadings and other acts of banditry. Most of its militant factions have pledged allegiance to Isis.

Days after the video went viral, hundreds of demonstrators turned up at a rally protesting against CECA and Singapore’s population growth. This public anger was reminiscent of that seen in 2013 when the government issued a projection that Singapore’s population could hit 6.9 million by 2030. The number currently stands at 5.7 million, roughly 1.7 million of whom are foreigners. Over the past month, the authorities have attempted to quell the disquiet by making multiple clarifications about the case. The man, Ramesh Erramalli, was born in India but is a naturalised Singaporean with a Singaporean wife. His education certificates were real, CECA did not make it easy for Indians to gain entry to the country for work; nor would any free-trade agreement, the government said. The display of xenophobia is not new to Singapore. “Foreigners” – from mainland Chinese to Filipinos – have been blamed for a range of problems, including overcrowding on public transport and unemployment. But the discomfort with those of Indian ethnicity has been shaped by the influx of educated foreign professionals over the last two decades, working in sectors ranging from finance to technology. For Indian national Nandita Gupta, 36, who moved to Singapore in 2010 and works as a designer at an international school, it is a fallacy that the floodgates are open for foreigners. She said recruiters had told her it was hard to find jobs for overseas applicants. Gupta has applied for permanent residency but without success. Since 2011, when immigration became an election issue, Singapore has tightened requirements for foreigners looking to relocate there. The number of Employment Passes – issued to foreign professionals, managers, executives and technicians – approved each year slowed to an average of 3,000 between 2014 and 2017, compared to a peak of 32,000 in 2011.

Read more In Singapore, can monster malls scare retail woes away? Read more If Singapore is so wealthy, why do its citizens feel stuck? But the fact that Erramalli is a citizen has not appeased Singaporeans like Gilbert Goh, who organised the anti-CECA protest. “I think he’s a new citizen and I don’t think he blended in, he didn’t integrate well,” Goh said, echoing the views of most respondents in a survey by the Institute of Policy Studies research centre. Close to seven in 10 of 4,015 citizens and permanent residents polled thought immigrants were not doing enough to integrate into Singapore. Trinity Joan, an administrator for a start-up, said the anger towards Erramalli was “not race-based” but rather about nationalism. “We need to protect our own. If someone misbehaves and is not from our country, we need to have a sense of nationalism and say: ‘You disrespected a Singaporean, so you’re out’,” the 30-year-old said. RACE AND CITIZENSHIP Singapore Indians were among those who raged against Erramalli in private gatherings and on social media, their feelings fuelled by the perception that these new migrants tend to look down on them. As National University of Singapore historian John Solomon recounted in a 2016 book on the Indian diaspora, members of the Tamil community have expressed concern about the appearance of caste names in wedding and funeral announcements in Singapore’s only Tamil-language newspaper. “Whether or not new immigration from India is indeed bringing about a gradual revival in caste identities in Singapore, the growth of this perception has manifested itself in popular xenophobic stereotypes about the new Indian migrant as an exporter of atavistic and backward social ideas,” he wrote. Kumaran Pillai, publisher of current affairs website  The Independent News , said recent Indian migrants tended to “have their own enclaves”. “They hang around and move in their own circles, they rarely mix and talk with locals,” Pillai said. Asked where this perception came from, he gave anecdotes. Pillai said Indian immigrants often cut queues “because [they are] richer or hold a better position”. It was common to see foreigners being rude to service staff, he added. “They’re perceived as a bit uppity, those in management positions. It’s not caste, it’s class consciousness,” Pillai said. He also gave examples in which Singaporean-Indian women had supposedly been judged by immigrant colleagues over practices deemed unacceptable in India, such as wearing short skirts or enjoying a drink in a bar with male co-workers. Mengi felt it had been difficult to make friends with locals when he first arrived in the city state, mainly because life was busy and most citizens already had a well-established circle of friends. Small cultural differences also played a part. Mengi realised that the way he used language growing up was “totally unacceptable in Singapore”. “If you tell somebody ‘no la, cannot be la, cannot’, where I come from we’d say, ‘aiya shut up la’. When I first said ‘shut up’ to somebody, everybody stopped dead in their tracks.” In a research paper published two years ago, Nanyang Technological University sociologist Laavanya Kathiravelu said divisions between recent immigrants and long-time residents had superseded the social divides once thought the most insurmountable – those of race. She wrote that Singapore’s racial mix had barely changed in 15 years owing to careful immigration controls. But although racial harmony had been maintained, intra-racial tensions had intensified. Kathiravelu said the state should move towards dismantling ethnic classifications and must encourage healthy discussion about race. She also believed the basis of the Singaporean national identity needed to change to become “truly multicultural and multiracial”. The National Integration Council, set up in 2009 to help foreigners and Singaporeans mix, said integration was a process that involved everyone. “Foreigners should learn, respect and adapt to our country’s culture and norms … They need time to adapt. Residents can help them by reaching out to neighbours,” the council said. Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist at the National University of Singapore, said any xenophobia would only subside “when foreigners are no longer seen as a threat or unfair competitors, when their behaviour is consistent with local norms, when they are not seen as taking advantage of Singapore – and, more generally, when Singaporeans feel less insecure”. For Mengi, the onus is on the immigrant to learn about the country and make an effort to fit in, something he has endeavoured to do. “I’ve spent more time in Singapore than anywhere else, including the place I was born. So I can’t be anything else. Sometimes, people ask where I would retire and I find this question bizarre. Where would I go? I don’t really know anything else.”  ■ Read more In Singapore, can monster malls scare retail woes away? Read more If Singapore is so wealthy, why do its citizens feel stuck?

The mall, which houses 200 shops, is part of a giant mixed-use development spanning four hectares, or about six soccer fields. The project, by Australia-headquartered property firm Lendlease, includes three high-spec office towers and 429 condominium units. “This precinct will ultimately house 10,000 workers and residents,” said Lendlease group chief executive officer and managing director Steve McCann during a speech at PLQ’s opening ceremony on October 24. In 2016, the island nation’s tallest building, the S$3.2 billion (US$2.3 billion) Guoco Tower, which sits on top of a railway station, opened in the heart of the central business district (CBD). Its developer GuocoLand paid a further S$1.62 billion for a 2.1-hectare, 99-year leasehold site on Beach Road, where the Singapore firm plans to build a mixed development consisting of offices, condominium units and a shopping mall.

BRINGING MALLS TO THE PEOPLE Retail sales in Singapore fell for eight consecutive months this year, from February to September, even as the retail vacancy rate held steady at about 7.5 per cent between the year’s second and third quarters. Part of the problem has been the economy. Growth has slowed to a crawl, with the economy expected to expand by between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent this year. With their incomes stretched, shoppers are pulling back. But a far bigger problem for most retailers has been the rise of e-commerce. People are now buying everything from coconuts to computers on e-commerce sites such as Lazada, Amazon and Taobao. Mall developers have tried to stem the tide by bringing in new restaurants, hosting performances and even conducting free yoga classes. The buzzword is “experiential”, and a recent paper by real estate consultancy Edmund Tie  &  Co said these activities had helped boost footfall, maintain high occupancy rates and shore up earnings. However, Knight Frank Singapore executive chairman Danny Yeo said tenants providing experiences such as rock-climbing and exercise classes might not be the first choice of landlords, who prefer to fill their spaces with food, beverage and fashion outlets that pay higher rent. “When such tenants are not forthcoming, then there is a need to embrace newer ideas such as gyms and experiential uses and hope that these will help drive traffic,” he said. “But at least they fill the mall up.” There is another tactic to counter the dwindling number of visitors. Instead of bringing people to the malls, developers are now bringing malls to the people. “The integrated model is the way to go,” said June Chua, Cushman  &  Wakefield’s head of leasing. “It is a congregation point to also benefit the community and residents in the area.” Offices and residential properties become natural catchment areas for retail, while retail and offices are key reasons people buy condominium units in integrated developments. Another draw is that many of these billion-dollar projects are built near or even atop major train stations, making accessibility a key feature. “The growing trend of integrated developments in non-CBD locations arises from the government’s drive to bring work closer to home to relieve congestion in the CBD,” said Tay Huey Ying, head of research and consultancy for JLL in Singapore, adding that such projects were a catalyst for development. Indeed, mixed-use behemoths are sprouting up from the suburban heartland in Singapore’s north to the CBD down south, and the mega-development idea is unlikely to slow down any time soon. “We definitely have an eye out on a couple of schemes here in Paya Lebar, [and] other places coming up like Kampong Bugis, Jurong Lake District in the future,” said Lendlease Asia chief executive officer Tony Lombardo. He said the firm had failed in its bid for a mixed-use project in Holland Village, also a city-fringe area – showing how intense competition is for prime sites in land-scarce Singapore. “We see the mixed-use [concept] as the better area for us to play in,” Lombardo said. Singapore-based property giant CapitaLand, which operates malls across Asia, has 19 in the Lion City – many of them integrated developments at train stations. The latest to be added to its portfolio is the upcoming S$2.2 billion redevelopment of Liang Court in Clarke Quay, which it is building with another local developer, CDL. Developers are also adapting their retail strategies. Instead of resisting disruption, many are now bending to the flow of progress. Valerie Wong, general manager for asset management at GuocoLand Singapore, dismissed the idea that technology and retail were incompatible. She noted the explosion of food deliveries in recent years, which has affected restaurant sales. “Rather than fight the food delivery companies, we created more dedicated areas for riders to pick up orders, benefiting our F & B stores so that it was a win-win situation,” Wong said. Partly due to this, gross turnover for retail units at Guoco Tower, which mainly comprise F & B outlets, increased about 20 per cent from 18 months ago. REVERBERATIONS AND RESERVATIONS But concerns remain over the retail landscape. The sector still faced an uncertain future, said Knight Frank’s Yeo. “Things may not be as sweet in the next few years. You can sense many big developers are very cautious and worried that the market may not be strong enough for too long.” More worrying, according to experts, is a potential oversupply of physical retail with the influx of large integrated developments. Alan Cheong, Savills executive director for research and consultancy, said: “My concern about more and more integrated developments is that it may soon reach a critical point – beyond which it starts to siphon away consumer expenditure from larger clusters such as those in town centres and malls.” With developers also focusing on large projects, smaller malls are likely to find it harder to secure tenants. Said Cushman and Wakefield’s Chua: “Maybe they can choose not to play in the same league as the big boys and go after similar tenants. They can find a niche for themselves, such as in IT products.” “Once the formula is repeated often enough, every other station will have two to three mixed-use developments around it. We may start to see vacant shops or dodgy traders appearing below residential blocks, even before e-commerce takes away the retailers,” said Ku Swee Yong, chief executive of real-estate brokerage International Property Advisor. Despite these concerns, the monster mall trend is set to rumble on, with billions already ploughed into upcoming projects. While the spectre of an oversaturated retail scene looms, for consumers like Chua Jia Ying, more variety is a good thing. “At this rate, I can visit a new mall every weekend,” she said. “It’s easy to get tired of the older malls.”  ■ Read more From Indians to Chinese, Singapore feels the strain of immigration Read more Singapore’s opposition floats ideas to fund retirement with home equity Read more How Singapore’s Sentosa Cove went from Crazy Rich Asians to a poor man’s Bali Read more If Singapore is so wealthy, why do its citizens feel stuck?

Ten of the wounded, including three children, were civilians, while five were police officers, he added. “The attack is believed to be part of the Communist Party of the Philippines '  celebration of its founding anniversary on December 26,” Aragones said. “This just proves that they have no respect for human rights and the lives of innocent civilians,” he added. “They have no conscience.” The police officers were riding in a vehicle along the highway, when a huge explosion occurred followed by a volley of gunfire, said army major Patrick Martinez. Unfortunately, a tricycle packed with civilians got caught in the crossfire, leaving a 69-year-old grandmother dead, he added. “The loss of life and the violence experienced by the victims are reprehensible,” said Communications Secretary Martin Andanar.

President Rodrigo Duterte terminated peace talks with the communist rebels in November 2017. Efforts to resume the talks have so far failed in light of escalating violence.

During the raid, armed officers wearing masks burst into the room where the group was rehearsing for an upcoming performance commemorating the end of Spanish colonisation, raised their guns and ordered everyone to lie face down on the ground, said Joe Del Mar A. Tano II, a member of the group. “They made us drop and look down so we wouldn’t see what they were doing inside the office,” said the 18-year-old, who added that he “was kicked by a policeman in the back” when he tried to look up after hearing some younger members of the group crying. The police carried out a search, emerging about 30 minutes later with a cache of firearms and explosives they said they had found in the offices Teatro Obrero were using as a practice space, leaving Tano and his fellow performers “shocked, because we don’t have firearms in our offices,” he said. As they were lined up and arrested, officers bound their wrists tightly with cable ties which – for the men at least – were not removed until after their first night in police custody, Tano said. There were 25 members of Teatro Obrero arrested that day, 13 of whom were minors. Those under 18 were mostly released by November 4 – the same day that the 12 adults were charged with illegal possession of firearms and explosives. Charges against 11 of them were dropped upon their release on November 6, but at the time of publication, one member of the group remained in custody.

Military personnel would also demand that they confess to being communist rebels “every time we went to the [toilet],” the 22-year-old said. Other members recalled being forced to dance for policemen who “mocked them” and “kept on laughing”, said Zara Alvarez of the rights group Defend Negros which worked to secure the performers’ release. “They never tortured us physically, but they tortured us mentally and emotionally,” said Junelle Miraflor, a 37-year-old who helps choreograph the group’s performances. The October 31 raids in Bacolod, the provincial capital of Negros Occidental and a long-time hub for local organisations advocating for land and labour rights, were described by an army public affairs chief on November 2 as “a product of thorough intelligence operations”. They were part of a series of counter-insurgency raids carried out on the central island of Negros that led to the arrests of 57 people – 13 of whom were under 18 – including members of Bayan Muna, militant trade unionist group Kilusang Mayo Uno, leftist women’s political advocacy organisation Gabriela Women’s Party and the National Federation of Sugar Workers, as well as 21 former workers for a regional bus company who had been laid off. Of those detained in the raids, seven remain in custody, four were released on bail and the rest were released after the charges against them were dropped. Earlier joint police and military operations in Negros, in December 2018 and March 2019, led to the deaths of 20 farmers and community leaders after Duterte issued an order giving the military sweeping authority to engage in counter-insurgency operations. In a statement on November 5, the Philippines Commission on Human Rights said it had dispatched a team to “investigate and closely monitor” whether the raids in Bacolod were “intended to silence or curtail legitimate dissent”. The arrests underscore a heightened sense of fear and paranoia in Negros, where activists regularly report receiving anonymous threats, being followed by unidentified men and subjected to police or military “visits”. A number of Teatro Obrero members said their families continue to receive such “visits” and that they are afraid of returning home – a tactic that Clarizza Singson, chair of the Negros chapter of Philippine rights group Karapatan, described as a possible attempt to “force them to testify” against other detainees.

They left the two behind because they could not drag them any more. They scampered in different directions but our troops are in pursuit,” Sobejana said. The Hyrons were not hurt in the 10-minute firefight, the military said, adding that no ransom was paid to the Abu Sayyaf militants. A picture released by the military showed the couple smiling in a military camp and talking with generals and other army officers in Sulu. Sobejana said the couple will undergo a medical check-up and will be interviewed by military officials.

Troops killed a “high-value” but little-known Abu Sayyaf commander, Talha Jumsah, on Friday near Sulu’s mountainous Patikul town. Jumsah acted as a key link between Isis and local jihadists and helped set up a series of deadly suicide attacks in Sulu this year. Troops killed five Abu Sayyaf militants, including two commanders, on Sunday in a separate clash in Sulu. One of the slain commanders, Sibih Pish, had been blamed for past ransom kidnappings. Abu Sayyaf emerged in the late 1980s as an offshoot of the decades-long Muslim separatist insurgency in the south of the largely Roman Catholic nation. After losing its commanders early in battle, Abu Sayyaf rapidly degenerated into a small but brutal group blamed for ransom kidnappings, beheadings and other acts of banditry. Most of its militant factions have pledged allegiance to Isis.
