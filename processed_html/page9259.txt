Cumani bows out at the Midlands track after 43 years as a trainer and Swansdown, who lines up in the 1m1 f nursery ( 5.30 ), has been supported from an opening show of 4-1 down to 11-10 generally, with Coral going 10-11 about the daughter of Dubawi. Cumani was not exactly bullish about Swansdown's chances when he spoke to the Racing Post on Wednesday, saying: "It s difficult to really tell exactly what sort of chance Swansdown has got. "It's her first run in a handicap and it looks an easier race than running those novices she ran in, but all we ve learned about her up until this point is that she s not good enough to win one of those." However, punters have latched on to the juvenile being successful and provide Cumani with a 26th and final winner of 2018.
