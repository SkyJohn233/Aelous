One running back thrives in the spotlight.

(Photo: Gregg Pachkowski, Gregg Pachkowski/gregg@pnj.com) Buy Photo It s been an impressive start for Pine Forest s passing attack in 2018   and it s only just the beginning. The same can be said for quarterback Ladarius  " LD "  Clardy and wide receiver Von Hill   who leads a deep crew of receivers with 34.7 yards per catch. And just like the beginning of the season has been optimistic for passing, the same can be said for the two juniors '  recruiting journey. Shortly after the Class of 2020 ' s recruiting period opened, Cincinnati contacted Hill and Clardy. It s the start for me,  Clardy said, who added that he exchanged messages with a few  coaches from Georgia State previously.  I want to improve on my passing game. I ve already got the run game down, but I want to be 50-50. I m good at passing now but I can be great. The duo ' s athleticism jumps off the page, as Clardy said he s been clocked at a 4.49 40-yard dash and Hill said he has a 39-inch vertical jump. With measurements like that, it s easy to understand why Hill calls Clardy s connection with Pine Forest s receivers  electric. And they ' ll aim to bring the electricity Friday, as Pine Forest (2-0) plays its biggest game yet when hosting Gulf Breeze (3-0) for a 7 p.m. kick off. It s been great seeing him develop as a quarterback since freshman year,  Hill said.  I see him grow each practice. It s been a great time. I want to improve on my route running and coming out of breaks to help me as a receiver. In addition to Cincinnati, Hill, who is 6-foot-1, 180-pounds said he has interest from Tulane and has exchanged text messages with Central Florida tight ends coach Jon Cooper. Both Hill and Clardy transferred from West Florida and are in their first seasons at Pine Forest. Pine Forest head coach Jason McDonald credits his quarterback and wide receivers for staying after practice for additional work. They do whatever it takes to get better,  McDonald said.  Clardy is a very athletic and very coachable guy. He s a student of the game. He comes up here to watch film on his own. He s the kind of guy I want to lead this offense and team. Though Clardy has varsity experience as a quarterback and defensive back from his sophomore year at West Florida, he has only two starts as a varsity quarterback under his belt  as Pine Forest used an early bye week in Week 2. In those wins, the 6-0, 170-pound quarterback has completed 26 passes on 39 attempts, for 396 yards and three touchdowns. He ' s run for 128 yards on 20 carries. Hill has been the big-play guy for Pine Forest, catching three passes for 104 yards and one touchdown. Eric Young leads Pine Forest receivers with 11 catches for 105 yards and one touchdown, followed by Tehrenzo Turner s five catches for 68 yards. The theme of bright futures continue as Turner and Young are also juniors. Brian Achatz can be reached at bachatz@pnj.com or 850-435-8521.
