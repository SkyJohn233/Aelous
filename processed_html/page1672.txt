Will you join us in the biggest  # TacticalVoting  operation ever?  Mark Francois says publishing the Russia Report would not “do the Conservatives any favours”.

Labour and Lib Dems MUST stand aside for each other in the key marginal seats. We are about to enter the most important general election of our lifetime. The result of it will define this country for years to come, maybe generations. Register to fucking vote. https://www. gov.uk/register-to-vo te … Clause 30 of the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill. What happens if the Government doesn’t propose an extension? Parliament would have no say and we would exit the transition period on the 31 Dec 2020 even if a trade agreement hadn’t been reached by then with the EU; ie no deal. pic.twitter.com/mbCAsrX0eB It is an attack on our democracy. Ever since the referendum Tory governments have sought to follow Goebbels '  post-referendum script. They have done everything in their power to evade and subvert Parliamentary and legal scrutiny. pic.twitter.com/IqxJltBVBM Donald Tusk will keep it simple this week in order to move swiftly. A third extension does not preclude a fourth.

If we can conceptualise it at all. Hopefully she is already running a Politics Department somewhere in the country. pic.twitter.com/m5fCsl4jdw Still can’t get my head around the whole “colluding with foreign powers” accusation from No10 at MPs accused of being anti-Brexit..When Boris Johnson asks EU leaders to hold back on granting/talking up idea of new extension, is that colluding with foreign powers too?

It more or less what the PM said in Parliament this afternoon. But also warns that the EU may not give an extension immediatley.  https:// twitter.com/number10leaks/ status/1185625551698087937 … BremainInSpain #FBPE added, Julie Nazerali Retweeted Sebastian Payne U allow Tory Brexit, GE win Lab crush?@PM4EastRen @ Y_FovargueMP @KevinBarronMP @ Steph_Peacock @ DanJarvisMP @ EmmaLewellBuck @ FitzMP @LauraSmithMP @ rosie4westlancs @ SarahChampionMP @ OnnMel @ lisanandy @ GloriaDePiero @ CarolineFlintMP @ gareth_snell @ RuthSmeeth @ SKinnock @ UKLabour https:// twitter.com/SebastianEPayn e/status/1185284224217157633 … Julie Nazerali added, Julie Nazerali Retweeted People ' s Vote UK . @ PM4EastRen @ Y_FovargueMP @KevinBarronMP @ Steph_Peacock @ DanJarvisMP @ EmmaLewellBuck @ FitzMP @ LauraSmithMP @ rosie4westlancs @ SarahChampionMP @ OnnMel @ lisanandy @ GloriaDePiero @ CarolineFlintMP @ gareth_snell @ RuthSmeeth @ SKinnock @ S_Hammond https:// twitter.com/peoplesvote_uk /status/1185247419321085952 … Julie Nazerali added, How many times do Labour Leavers need to be told? 1) passing this deal isn ' t  " getting it done " - it ' s just start of another excruciating phase 2) neither Gov nor statutory  promises to protect rights/standards mean anything- new Gov with Commons majority can scrap them.
