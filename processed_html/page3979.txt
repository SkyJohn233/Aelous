We created a small village of 17 independent residences, of traditional Cycladic architecture, built fully in harmony with the beautiful landscape.  Just few steps from the beach, each residence provides stunning sea views and combines the privacy of a holiday home with the services and facilities of a hotel. It is an ideal solution for families with young children and group of friends that can be accommodated in nearby houses. The bar area, with the small amphitheatre, offers charming views of Ios Village and the beautiful church Agia Irini. It is the “square” – meeting point of the small village.  Periodically it hosts exhibitions, musical and theatrical performances. It offers an ideal choice for travelers that appreciate the beauty of Cycladic environment and architecture.
