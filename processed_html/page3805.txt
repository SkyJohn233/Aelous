All Critics (5)                 |  Fresh (4)         |  Rotten (1)                                             Godzilla: Planet of Monsters did a decent job setting up the world and introducing some concepts that have some real potential, but the weak character development is really a killer.                                     Taylor Made                                             ...a bland entry in a trilogy that has great potential.                                     Jonathan Barkan                                             Animation proves to be an exemplary medium for this story, particularly the lovely hybrid animation form used here.                                     Tim Brayton                                             Beautifully animated, with a lush color palette and inventive, space opera influenced designs, Planet of the Monsters does what all the best reboots do.                                     Mike Cecchini                                             Being two of Japan's biggest pop-cultural exports, it's a small wonder Godzilla and anime haven't been brought together before now. But better late than ever.                                     Matt Schley                 There are no featured audience reviews for Godzilla: Monster Planet at this time.
