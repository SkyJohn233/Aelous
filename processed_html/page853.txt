Aviva Stadium Given the non-league look to the end behind one of the goals, it may look like they ran out of money at the end of the build. However, part of the deal to renovate Lansdowne Road in 2007 was that the Aviva would be constructed to make sure nearby residents had enough natural light, and the green bowl satisfies that requirement. It also satisfies UEFA, who put it on the elite list and gave it the 2011 Europa League final – an all-Portuguese affair between Porto and Braga for which it was temporarily renamed the Dublin Arena – and four matches at Michel Platini’s Europe-wide Euro 2020. A raucous Irish atmosphere is pretty much guaranteed no matter who the opponent is and with the only other permanent occupants being the Irish national rugby team, the pitch is always in decent nick for Martin O’Neill’s side to play ball. -  JF ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 87. Cape Town Stadium Formerly known as Green Point Stadium, Cape Town’s impressive football ground was one of the venues created specifically for the 2010 World Cup. Indeed it hosted eight matches of varying quality during the tournament, from Holland’s pulsating 3-2 semi-final win over Uruguay through Portugal’s 7-0 hammering of North Korea to England’s drab 0-0 stalemate with Algeria. The new arena now gives one of the world’s great cities a superb venue for top-class sports and music events, not too far from the popular V & A waterfront area and clearly visible from Table Mountain, which provides a stunning backdrop. Trouble is, like many a showpiece stadium, it needs to pay for itself thereafter; the local council tried to tempt Western Province rugby union team as anchor tenants, but after four years of talks the deal collapsed. At least the annual South Africa Sevens rugby tournament is to be held at the venue for the next few years, while Ajax Cape Town have made themselves cosy as football tenants. You shouldn’t struggle to get tickets. –  GM I WAS THERE:  "...for seven of the 2010 World Cup matches held at the Cape Town Stadium. Despite bad weather and England's dismal performance the party atmosphere and sleek, modern arena made for a top football holiday." –  Gregor McGregor , FFT Deputy Digital Editor #FFT100STADIUMS   The 100 Best Stadiums in the World: list and features here
