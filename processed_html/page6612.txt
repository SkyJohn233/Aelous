However, the latter isn't something that every family has the luxury of doing. A new initiative from the local nonprofit  Collier Harvest  plans to change that. And not just this season, but year-round. Last week, students and families from East Naples Middle School met after school for a monthly food drive that includes a free meal, a week's worth of groceries and a ham to boot. Afterward, parents enjoyed a monthly educational presentation that discusses a variety of topics, such as learning how to discipline a child, and helping with homework. It's part of Collier Harvest's new initiative, Collier CAN!, which provides food to families in need by working with the Collier County School District and local businesses. It all began with Naples resident Dawn Silverman, who reached out to the nonprofit about a year ago because she wanted to do something to help families in need.

(Photo: Ashley Collins) "(My sister) teaches here, and she was always saying how the kids are always hungry, and she's always looking for snacks. So I thought, 'Why don't we do something?'" She chose East Naples Middle because it's one of the schools in Collier County that's a Title I school, which means a high percentage of students live in low-income households, with 77.4 percent of the students on the reduced price or free lunch program. Silverman asked five businesses — Moe’s Southwest Grill, Fish Crazy, Gulf Breeze Real Estate, Rick Johnson Tire  &  Auto and IRMS Inc. —  to donate $200 a month to purchase enough food for about 50 families every month. They agreed. The initiative took off at the start of the fall semester. East Naples Middle School Principal Darren Burkett greets, and serves food to students and their families on Dec. 15, 2016.

Burkett said he was quickly on board when he heard about the initiative, and thought it would be a perfect marriage with the school's monthly educational presentation. "We knew that we had this component already in place, so we said, 'Let's build around this.'" Collier CAN! is just one of the many projects that Collier Harvest takes on to feed the hungry in the community. For more than 20 years, they've worked to assist small agencies that need help providing for individuals who otherwise may not receive food in the community, said Annette Kirk, with Collier Harvest. "We feel like we're making a big impact," Kirk added. Christmas was in the air as music played in the background while more than 100 people ate together. Cindy Godinez, 13, sat and talked with her dad, Juan Godinez. The two have come to the monthly meeting for the past four months to share food and laughs with others in the community.

"I feel happy," she said as she ate a holiday meal with all the fixings. After dinner, they grabbed a bag full of groceries to take home for the rest of their family.
