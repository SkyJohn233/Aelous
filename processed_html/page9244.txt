Xbox 5 5 User Rating: 5 out of 5 A lot of fun, great story, tons of side missions, fun combat system, AND TWO short bonus side stories after the main story! Plus customization through the wardrobe, collection items, cars... This game is a lot of fun. From street races to fight club to karaoke, this game is more than just its story, and is a wonderful addition to your collection. Xbox 5 5 User Rating: 5 out of 5 I almost missed out on this thoroughly enjoyable game. Great story and pretty tight gameplay mechanics all around. It &# x27;s not too short nor does it overstay it &# x27;s welcome. If you &# x27;re an achievement junkie this is a good game for that as well. Definitely recommend. A pity we will never get a sequel. Xbox 5 5 User Rating: 5 out of 5 the game has great missions dlc combat world truley the 7th best game of alltime it reminds me of true crime Xbox 5 5 User Rating: 5 out of 5 This game is incredibly good. The fighting is really fun and being a car guy I really enjoyed collecting the cars too. Lots of collectibles and side missions galore. Best game I &# x27;ve played in a long time! Xbox 4 5 User Rating: 4 out of 5 Story is pretty solid as well as characters. I like the combat system A LOT because it &# x27;s far more complex than games like gta. Not a lot of gun variety, but gunfights are still fun. Similar to gta with the crime open world aspect but it &# x27;s still different in a lot of ways. It has a way of getting your adrenaline pumping, and it &# x27;s probably one of the best free games xbox has put out. Xbox 5 5 User Rating: 5 out of 5 Be Wei Shen. Great game, esp. if you are a GTA fan. More focus placed on hand2hand combat which is cool and encourages you to get the most out of Hong Kong. Story is great, combat is engaging, driving is fun (esp. w/ high end cars) and just really I can &# x27;t say enough about this gem. Was fortunate to get it free w/ gold but wouldn &# x27;t be mad if I bought it. Xbox 5 5 User Rating: 5 out of 5 Great Game.Worth the buy.Open world with a atmosphere that draws you in. Never a dull moment big thanks to the creator for this experience. Game also gives you a different vibe from gta. Everyone should play this game atleast once in there life.NEED THAT PART 2 THO ASAP. YOU CAN TAKE MY MULAH. Xbox 5 5 User Rating: 5 out of 5 This game right here is the bee &# x27;s knee &# x27;s. It is definitly on par with GTA if not better than some of them. Story, characters, gameplay, setting its all awesome! Most fun I &# x27;ve had on a game in awhile! Xbox 4 5 User Rating: 4 out of 5 pleasant surprise. well done story , fun combatdlc is short but fun. controls can be funky and it doesn &# x27;t. always run smooth, but i had a very good time with it. Xbox 5 5 User Rating: 5 out of 5 Bought this game about a year ago on sale. I just recently started playing it and I have to say that it &# x27;s a great game.  even compared to today &# x27;s games.  It has a lot to do. You are an undercover cop in Tokyo so you get to work both sides of gangs and police.   It has a great story good graphics, tight controls and is am overall good game. The fighting and driving in it is really fun and I would suggest it to anyone that is a fan of GTA or Watchdogs. Buy it! Especially if it &# x27;s on sale.
