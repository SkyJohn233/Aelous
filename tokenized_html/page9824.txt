tom 's hardware ces 2019 awards from 7nm chips to robot butlers tom 's hardware logo by the editors of tom 's hardware january 10 2019 finally some hardware innovations we can sink our teeth into this year s ces was dominated by chips as nvidia and amd both unveiled new gpus and team red also gave a sneak peek of its upcoming third-generation ryzen platform the show floor and demo suites were teeming with new notebooks and desktops that were powered by some of the latest graphics cards rgb was everywhere from video cards to ssds and who can forget ubtech which showed off walker a 4.7-foot bipedal robot that can climb stairs grasp objects and respond to voice commands what about an rgb laptop bag that can charge your other devices these were just a few of the innovations we saw at ces 2019 here are our favorite products of the show amd s ryzen series of processors have revitalized the market but the company s transition to the 7nm process could leave its competitors reeling the 7nm process is denser than other gpu and x86 cpu technology allowing the company to pack more transistors into the same footprint thus lowering cost and improving performance and power efficiency amd is using the new manufacturing technology for both its third-gen ryzen matisse lineup and the radeon vii graphics card which promises to shake up the market as intel struggles to transition to the 10nm process and nvidia remains on a 12nm refinement of tsmc 's 16nm process amd s third-gen ryzen processors also come with the new zen 2 microarchitecture which should magnify the performance improvements we haven t seen the end products in our labs yet so the final verdict is still out on overall performance but amd s fast transition to a smaller node brings the promise of cheaper faster and lower-power processors and graphics cards in the very near future read more amd demos third-gen ryzen cpus launches 7nm radeon vii gpu alienware 's area-51m is the desktop replacement that many have been dreaming of it 's a stunning mix of the rgb gamer aesthetic with a more adult look thanks to clean lines and curved edges on top of that its desktop class internals including up to an intel

triples airflow letting the company pack in a 12-core intel core i9-9920x cpu and an nvidia rtx 2080 ti along with 32gb of ram considering the 12-liter chassis size and small footprint this is an exceptional feat of engineering and according to corsair there 's plenty of thermal capacity for even higher-end parts like a 18-core xtreme edition cpu and an nvidia rtx titan card high-end content

ll get your money s worth even if the promise of widespread ray tracing doesn t come to fruition more games are coming to market that will support ray tracing though and the rtx 2060 offers enough
