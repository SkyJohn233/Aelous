elizabeth lesser talks about her book broken open and omega institute beliefnet it 's kind of the end of life as we know it.of certain dreams or expectations it 's hard to think of something good growing out of something so bad yes the cracking of our shell feels like a pain we ca n't bear so we shut down to that pain but in doing so we shut down to the next stage of our life and over a lifetime we can accumulate these strong scars over the times we 've felt broken and the ability to hear the messages that come in our difficult times becomes less and less what happened in your personal life that made you want to put this all together and teach it to others well the first motivation was the times in my own life when a loss or a change overwhelmed me so much that it caused me to re-evaluate who i was what i wanted where my life was going and the big one for me was my divorce my self-image as a good mother a good wife a good person was really shattered when my marriage crumbled i never thought it would happen to me no one in my family had ever gone through it it made me feel like there was something profoundly wrong about me and it sent me spiraling down into a place in which i started to feel i was losing everything through the grace of having around me the tools that could help me i used it as the swinging door between who i was before and who i was after i was really a profoundly different person since then as i teach about growth and transformation i have heard so many people say before i had cancer i did n't know who i was i did n't know what life was about i was sleepwalking. or before i got kicked out of my job i was just kind of going through the paces or i thought i was x and now i know i 'm y. if you actually take the challenge and use the difficult times to grow you find that part in yourself that is whole already-and that can survive any difficulty and actually survives death you find your eternal soul all the great spiritual masters reveal this in their lives culminating in the story of christ we find ourselves through the dark night of the soul you 've had the advantage at omega of studying with many of the major spiritual figures of our time and with teachers of every faith who inspired you most in getting through the dark night of the soul my first teacher and my enduring teacher was the sufi master pir vilayat inayat khan who died a few weeks ago and the teaching of sufism is the teaching of the broken heart actually the symbol of the sufi path is a heart with wings is that a visual symbol we can see or is it spoken about in poetry no you can see it everywhere you can find the heart with wings if you wanted to look it up on the website of the sufi order of north america and there is a beautiful line from pir-o-murshid inayat khan who is my teacher 's father who brought the sufi teachings to the west he says out of the shell of the broken heart arises the newborn soul. rumi and all the great sufi saints and masters teach that a broken heart is an open heart if we could fit in the full feeling function of the heart and not close down the pain then we can stay open also to the joy that 's really the sufi teaching ascendancy has its place in spiritual life obviously but so does descent into the dark into the fertile dark womb when we 're going through an uncomfortable painful time-like i 'm going through one right now my mom died recently i 'm so sorry to hear that i think i 'm such a creature of our culture i want to get on with it i feel so uncomfortable being cloudy and sad and confused and everything in me rears up to want to be my regular old self here i 've just written a book that 's telling me and all of us the opposite that when a difficult time comes we ca n't rush through it it can take a long time and if we do rush through it then we lose the opportunity for growth so sitting tight in the discomfort and the pain until the dark work is done is probably the hardest part of this journey of broken open. what would help you now if you could stand outside yourself and give yourself advice on how to handle this loss one is to just stop slow down and feel what 's going on and when that urge to get up and do something comes to you gently quiet it and stay with the uncomfortable feelings that something major is changing in your life that 's one thing and there are all sorts of spiritual practices that can assist in that meditation prayer working with the body yoga and other kinds of exercise so that we 're not running away from what 's really going on but how long can you stay with that if other things are calling you out to go and be part of the world it 's not necessarily that we ca n't do what we always do in life we have to i mean we have to keep our children fed and we have to keep bringing in the paycheck it 's not that the feelings the internal feelings of loss confusion discomfort will happen to us whether we 're busy active in the world or not it 's the turning away from what 's going on in the inside that needs to be addressed you can be making dinner for your children and feeling that inner gnawing in the heart what i call the sleeping giant that wants to wake up the lessons that are coming on the winds of change and you can still be doing everything in the world and stay attuned to those voices now it does really help if you could carve out forty-five minutes a half hour even ten minutes if that 's all you have to sit tight sit down be alone and just go in the direction that your internal soul river is flowing instead of swimming so hard against it and lo and behold we actually do metabolize our grief more quickly and more fully if we 're resisting it and pushing it away it goes underground it goes somewhere else it shows up as sickness shows up as anger i think that many of us have an image of ourselves as being highly responsible we really do n't want to invite trouble into our lives and yet sometimes it comes yes it does and one thing that happens when it comes is that it busts our self-image as the one who can protect everyone from everything and we have to just say i 'm not in control here and it 's not my role to be in control here i am a participant with the rest of these bumbling fools on planet earth. lighten up give in allow life to be.that 's one of the great messages of being broken open i 'm not the master of everything here in the book you also talk about the phoenix process which you teach in your workshops could you explain what you mean by that i love mythology and i think the teaching myths of the world religions and the world cultures have just really helpful imagery to grind into us these lessons and one myth i love which you can find in many of the world traditions is this image of a bird burning and then finding its true self in the ashes the one we 're most familiar with is the egyptian myth where a great bird lives and every 500 years he feels the winds of change coming and builds this big pyre of herbs where he sits until he 's burned completely he does n't just put his toe in it and feel the heat he just burns his entire being and the ashes smolder and burn down then out of the ashes arises the newborn phoenix and he 's the same bird he always was but he 's new he 's his more eternal self so the phoenix process is named for this myth and it 's about change in our own life would you say that the result is more of an internal process or something you can point to something that you can see in the world or something you see within yourself ultimately it 's only about what you see in yourself if it 's just an external change it really does n't mean anything but sometimes it takes an external change to help you make the internal changes and it 's not a one size fits all story for everyone i 've seen people utterly transform their marriages have a born-again marriage-from a revealed affair from a deadness in a marriage and a commitment to making inner change i 've seen that happen as many times as i 've seen divorce so you can have a broken heart and learn from that and save your marriage or not save your marriage and it 's the same thing for a job you can feel you 're in a soul-killing job and lo and behold if you make it all known if you talk about it if you work about it if you 're honest with your colleagues boss and organization you may not have to leave it you were very honest in the book in talking about the affair that you had with the man you call the shaman lover and how that precipitated a kind of end to the sleep-walking do you think you need another person to help you move out of a marriage that 's dead-someone who comes and breaks the shell i did but i really want to be clear again that not everybody does my particular issue was that i had never really been born into my body i was raised in pretty puritanical way and even though i 'd had two children and been a midwife i was someone who was still very caught up in being ashamed of my sexuality and caught up in an image of who i was supposed to be vis a vis marriage love romance i was living a very sheltered and small experience of everything i could be as a women-i really had n't entered my womanhood and i really did n't think i had to it had never been valued in my family i grew up in a very intellectual family i married very young and we married into a spiritual community so everything was going in the opposite direction of where ultimately my soul needed to go-which was descending into myself as a woman and learning to love my own body so it was a humbling and utterly life-altering experience for me to fall in love with someone outside of the marriage and to pursue it and to be given my womanhood and it took a huge risk he 's not the man you ended up with he was n't what we used to call husband material. no he was not husband material but he was transformation material and often whether we 're talking about a love affair or we 're talking about a change brought on through work or a child who 's difficult often the person or the situation that can change us is not husband material and that 's why i called it the shaman lover. there 's a shamanic energy of destruction to it it was a really scary thing for me to write about but the book made me do it because after so many years at omega of meeting teachers of reading more books than is probably legal about the self-help movement i began to get suspicious of people talking about human transformation who did n't talk about their own humanness and the more i started saying to myself i 'm going to write this book really honestly because that 's what will help people the more i stayed true to that mission the more i found it asking me to tell the truth about myself very quickly i figured out i was going to have to talk about the stuff i did n't want to one of the pieces i read on the book tour that people love the most is that little story called bozos on the bus. it 's about how we spend so much time pretending to each other that our lives are all together because we do n't want to admit that we 're just a bozo on the bus. but lo and behold when you admit that to someone else there 's so much freedom and there 's so much intimacy created i would read that chapter and it would encourage someone to raise their hand and say something like i was just diagnosed with cancer or my wife left me or i hate my job. and just one person saying that in a group of 60 people you could feel the whole group just sighing-like the jig 's up we 're all just bozos on the bus we can get on with really being together. so i had to reveal my bozo-hood and it was the shaman lover story that was it for me
