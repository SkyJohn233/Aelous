Guests at Sable Alley have the opportunity to make the most out of this camp’s enviable location. Set in a private wildlife concession bordering the famous Moremi Game Reserve, this tented camp overlooks the permanent water and green floodplains of the Okavango Delta in an especially game-rich area. Elephant and buffalo herds are often seen in front of camp, and the surrounding woodlands are home to the rare, elusive and beautiful sable antelope after which the camp was named. There are 12 tented suites at Sable Alley, each mounted on its own viewing deck and with an en suite bathroom. You also have the chance to spend a blissful evening away from camp in one of the star-beds, set high in a tree above a waterhole and open to the night sky. Activities at camp usually focus on the morning and afternoon game drives but you can also take to the water in a traditional canoe (known as a mokoro) or, when water levels are high enough, explore by motor boat. Activities take place in the private concession, your expert guide reading the season and landscape for the best sightings, but you may explore Moremi Game Reserve as well. It is an area well known for its predators – lion, leopard, wild dog, cheetah, crocodile and spotted hyena can all be seen here – and it is an excellent bird-watching destination. Its private setting also means your guide is allowed to drive off-road for extra close sightings and to conduct spot-lit night drives. There are 12 very spacious timber and canvas suites at Sable Alley, each mounted on its own wooden deck and with views over the in-house waterhole. Crisp-lined and decorated with style and flair, you also have your own private bathroom with both indoor and outdoor shower. Sable Alley has a central lodge area built on raised wooden decking and offering superb views over the floodplains and waterhole in front of camp. There are plenty of shaded areas to sit back and absorb it all and it is here that you will find the lounge, bar and indoor and outdoor dining areas. There is a pool surrounded by sun loungers and shade umbrellas, and a fire pit where you end the day with cold drinks around a camp fire as your dinner is prepared. There is no Internet connectivity but the camp does have a central charging station for devices and batteries. All meals and selected drinks are included at Sable Camp and meals are taken communally unless private dining is requested. You begin the day with an early wake-up call served with tea, coffee and biscuits. Following your return from your morning activity, you sit down to a hearty mid-morning breakfast. Lunch is served after your siesta, and there is time for high tea before you head out on your afternoon activity. Dinner is a 3-course affair, served under the stars or under canvas.
