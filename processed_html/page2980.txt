However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today’s newsroom and any business incentives. Looking to do a little shopping to get you through that mid-week slump? Frankly, Amazon's deals are not super thrilling today. Most of the offers in the Gold Box are on products from unheard-of brands with either low or fake ratings. That, or the deals aren't actually as good as they seem. But I managed to find a handful of diamonds in the rough that you might be interested in. These are all highly rated, personally used, or professionally tested products we are confident you'll enjoy, especially at their discounted prices. Faster charging. and stronger cables make life a little more convenient. (Photo: Anker) Anker's braided Powerline+ charging cables are great. Not only does the braided cord prevent tangles and fraying, but the cables are durable and they charge your device as fast or faster than the cord that came with it. Right now, Anker has discounts on its 6-foot USB-C and 3-foot lightning cables that knock the price down below $10. I have a lot of these cables in my home, with a collection of every cord my guests could ever need in our living room to phone charging cables in the bed that are long enough to use comfortably. It's a serious game changer. I'd recommend getting the 3-foot cables if you're an Apple user in need of a desktop charging setup or have a charging station that came with a super slow charger. The 6-foot cables are perfect for using USB-C devices while they're charging, whether on the couch or in bed. For under $20, this is the perfect replacement for your old, worn-out cookware. (Photo: T-Fal) The T-Fal line is one of those affordable-but-good cookware brands. I've been using the same T-Fal pots and pans for years, and they're completely sufficient for the casual home cook. Are they perfect? Probably not. But are they good enough if you're on a budget and really need to replace that old scratched up, no-longer-nonstick pan? Absolutely. The 12-inch frying pan, which usually costs around $35, is down below $20 for the first time since last July, making it the perfect opportunity. It's got a heat indicator that turns solid red when the pan is fully warmed, and in my personal (and amateur) experience I've never noticed a disparity in heat distribution. Get the T-Fal 12-inch Nonstick Frying Pan for $18.80 and save $17 Treat yourself to a warm and cozy bed. (Photo: Utopia Bedding) If you've had the same blanket for years, even if you wash it as often as you should, it's probably getting worn out. So why not replace it for less than $30? This comforter is designed to be comfy on its own or to be used as a duvet insert. With more than 5,000 positive reviews , this blanket typically sells for around $32, but you can save a few bucks right now and make your bed an even more enticing place to be. Get the Utopia Bedding Queen Comforter for $28.04 and save $6 Skip running—try a fun cardio routine (Photo: Sunny Heath and Fitness) Let's face it. Running and cycling aren't for everyone, but if you're looking for a way to get your cardio workout at home, they can feel like the only options. But have you considered rowing? Right now Amazon's running a deal on a magnetic rowing machine for $170, the lowest price we've seen in nearly a year for equipment that usually costs around $220. It gives you eight levels of resistance so your workouts are always challenging, and an easy to read LCD screen. Sure, it'll take up some room in your home, but it's got roughly the same footprint as a treadmill. If you've never tried rowing, as a fellow running un-enthusiast, I can tell you it's quite fun and much easier on your willpower. Get the Sunny Health and Fitness Magnetic Rowing Machine for $169.9 and save $50 This is our favorite Kindle ever. (Photo: Amazon) If you promised yourself you'd read more in 2018, but you never seem to have enough room on your bag for that library book, make the switch to an e-reader. Kindles are the best e-readers out there, and the Paperwhite is the cream of the crop. It blends all the best features (the white page-like screen, the ability to read even in direct sunlight, a super long-lasting battery) with an affordable price, and if you're ok with buying refurbished, you can save even more. Plus, Prime members have access to the Kindle Lending Library, which includes thousands of books you can 'borrow' as long as you want, one at a time, for free reading. Get the Certified Refurbished Kindle Paperwhite for $79.99 and save $30 Prices are accurate at the time this article was published, but may change over time.
