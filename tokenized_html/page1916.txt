undisclosed verified buyer verified buyer verified buyer submitted as part of a sweepstakes entry reviewed at we chose whirlpool appliances in our new kitchen because whirlpool has a reputation of reliability and ease of use we chose this range specifically because we used its delay start feature regularly with our previous whirlpool range whirlpool corporate told our technician that the user manual does not coincide with the actual range and it is not going to be remedied too bad for us we must now activate delay start the way a dishwasher delay start is activated cumbersome bottom line no i would not recommend to a friend was this review helpful to you 0 0 submitted 1 month ago by edta from red deer submitted as part of a sweepstakes entry reviewed at i am disappointed in my purchase of this range i don t like the fact that the clock goes off when the range is in use our last range could display the oven temperature and the time at the same time this is good when you need to leave an item in the oven for a certain time also the storage area below the oven is too small not capable of storing any pots i realize the oven space is large but i would give up some oven capacity for more storage space below i don t like the care and attention the glass top requires i would want a much steadier heartier range top one that can handle some spills i would not recommend this product bottom line no i would not recommend to a friend was this review helpful to you 0 0 submitted 1 month ago by jackie 36 from bowling green ohio verified buyer verified buyer verified buyer

the features nothing fits in the drawer too shallow cook top takes work to keep clean the stainless scratches easily you must hold on to the pans or they could slip off while stirring food i do like
