Patrice Bergeron Steps Up as Arbella Player of the Week | Arbella Player of the Week | NESN.com  When first-string center  Marc Savard  went down,  Patrice Bergeron  knew it was his job to step up.  Bergeron has tallied a team-high eight points this season, including two in the last week alone. Bergie potted the B ' s lone goal in their 2-1 loss to the Devils at the Garden on Thursday night and accounted for an assist on  David Krejci ' s game-tying goal with less than a minute to go in Boston ' s 4-3 shootout win over the Senators last Saturday. The 24-year-old Bergeron has stepped in as the front-line center after Savard was shelved earlier this month with a broken foot, which will sideline him for at least a month. Bergeron, already in his sixth season with the club, remains a crucial member of the penalty-kill unit and is 16 goals shy of his 100th career NHL goal. Bergeron and the B ' s take on the Oilers on Saturday. The center has two goals and three assists in four career games against Edmonton. On Sunday, Boston travels to Madison Square Garden to battle the Rangers, against whom Bergie has three goals and six helpers in 16 career games. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.
