CDI interceptor binding doesn't work |JBoss Developer Hi, I'm New to the forum so first of all I want to say hello. I'm learning JEE from few months and like every newbie I encounter issues. In most cases I find the solutions at google, books, forums, stackoverflow etc., but sometimes it doesn't work. So I'm here and I believe that I find few answers from the more experienced developers. Recently I created a little project with CDI examples. Everything works fine except features that are configured with deployment descriptor. My simple app works without interceptor bindings or alternatives defined in beans.xml. So my question is do I need to configure something else in the JBoss? Below I present my interceptor binding files. You can find all project here:  https://github.com/dstepien/jee7-examples beans.xml ProfileInterceptor.java DatePrinterBean.java Profiling.java Thanks, Dawid Ok, I resolved my problem. I just migrate from JBoss 7 to WildFly and my simple project works perfectly  . Unable to retrieve content from the server: You are now following {0}. You have stopped following {0}.
