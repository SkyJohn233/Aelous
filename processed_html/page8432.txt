These changes are reflected as on the external (formal) as the internal (meaningful) level. The main requirement of the government to the current pedagogical process is to ensure purposeful process of education and training in the interests of the individual and society. Thus, one of the basic principles (on a par with the patriotic education) is "to create favorable conditions for the integration of the education system of the Russian Federation with the educational systems of other countries on an equal and mutually beneficial basis" [FL, 2012, No 273].    The successful implementation of this requirement of an integrative education and the fact that the Russian Federation is an integral part of the world culture and the economy are directly dependent on the elimination of cultural, linguistic and economic barriers to such cooperation. In this case, pedagogy as one of the main mechanisms for the implementation of the state program is changing the attitude to the foreign culture in the Russian society: it's important not to love but to understand the others and to accept them in originality. Such change will be the key to attracting the attention of the younger generation in the process of globalization in the world. This aspect of the modernization of the system of modern education leads to the increased requirements for mastering a foreign language. As a result there are more chances for the unhindered communication with non-native speakers.    The aim to create barrier-free environment has determined the content of the Federal State educational standards (FSES) for secondary (full) general education [FSES, 2012, No 413]. Thus, in accordance with the paragraph 9.1.2., the substantive result of a foreign language acquisition is the formation of communicative competence in it. The determining factor in such understanding the importance of mastering a non-native (foreign) language is not in favor of the learning the language itself but the mastery of a foreign language culture. This change forces to reassess the system of goal-setting work of the foreign language teacher. His task should not be reduced to learning the language but to the formation of foreign language culture representation by the students.    METHODS    The concepts of cultural dialogue and understanding [M. Bakhtin, 1976], the language person [Karaulov, 2009], the competence (Eck, 1990; Savignon, 1991; Hutorskoy, 2013], communicative and cognitive approaches (Schepilova, 2005; I.Bim, 2007], the concept of integration in education [Archipenko, 2007] formed the methodological basis of the study. The theoretical bases of the research are works of literary theory [Tyupa, 2002] and methods of teaching literature [Svirina, 2010; Golikova, 2014].    There are also used a complex of complementary research methods: theoretical methods (the study and analysis of the scientific literature on the history of literature, linguistics, pedagogy and methods of teaching foreign languages); empirical methods (analysis of written work; monitoring the process of learning).    RESULTS    The priority areas defined by FSES based on achieving not only the subject but also metasubject results. For the Foreign language as a school subject it gives more chances to involve the student to the process of enlarging their erudition by teaching them how to search for the information. It's possible because of the foreign language teacher helps pupils to drop into the social problem. In his case there is the very effective possibility to demonstrate the world in its variety. That's why it's important to teach the young learners to accept the existing contrasting views on life. To aim the following the methods used by the teacher should be oriented to the modern principles based on the inter-subject relationship for the forming culture-centered competence.    PRACTICE    The Teaching of English Literature in The Modern School    In this part of the study the experience of Literature teaching in English at Municipal Budgetary General Education Institute "School No 49" of Novo-Savinovsky district of Kazan is presented. The foreign language teachers of the school are not limited to the studying materials in fiction given in modern textbooks. In this educational institute the foreign language culture formation is carried out in the study groups. Thus, students have the right to attend additional English classes on English literature and culture. Methodical efficiency of studying Literature in its original, first of all, is provided by the creation of an enabling environment for an independent construction of meaning and the creation of reader discourse during the interaction of the author and the reader. In this case there is a relationship between the participants in the communicative act is a special kind of dialogue--"the meeting between the two texts: the finished and create responsive texts, therefore, the meeting of two entities, the two authors," [Bakhtin, 1976: 127]. The peculiarity of the teacher in these classes is that students are engaged not in translation but in the philological analysis of the text. During the lesson theme, idea of the text are discussed, the main attention is given to the author's artistic method. Very often in the course of the discussion, students are faced with the mismatching of reader expectations with the author's intention. One of the main reasons for this discrepancy is in the meeting of two cultures, the bearer of which is participants in the artistic dialogue. But in the course of resolving this misunderstanding the acceptance of cultural identity rooted in the work is achieved.    The philological Analyze in English    The works of art by the 20th century American author Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961) usually cause a keen interest in the teenage audience. Such students' interest in issues raised in his works, the originality of the author's literary manner, low-key style allows the teacher to choose the material for the philological analysis of samples of his works. Students are given the task to read in advance the work of art by the author to a particular lesson. In this case, The Old Man and the Sea was chosen for discussing in the lesson. The technological map of the lesson (Table 1) represents one of the practical examples of using fiction in English for the forming culture-oriented competence. This material is approbated with the 9-th form students of Municipal Budgetary General Education Institute "School No 49" of Novo-Savinovsky district of Kazan.    SUMMARY    Nowadays in pedagogy one of the most effective roles is lead to Literature (according to its high educational level). It's evident, that the work of art can't exist without the lexical and grammatical support. This is a good example of where language acts as a tool to create a cultural masterpiece.    This form of integrative learning where there is an interaction between Fiction and Linguistics draws attention of researchers. So, scientists are paying attention to the possibility of development of intellectual and creative abilities of students in the classroom reading of works of art in the original [Zagrayskaya, 2009], explore the communicative potential of fiction in the language study [Stul, 2007; Golikova, 2014], develop the basic techniques and methods of working with artistic text in a foreign language [Sadykova, 2014]. Anyway, the main issue that brings modern technique boils down to is to move away from the realities of grammar in the text and draw attention to the cultural code contained in it.    Nowadays in textbooks, where the authors are taking into account the basic requirements for FSES, the problem of the formal relationship to get acquainted with English literature has been managed to solve. The modern textbooks has moved away from the formal approach. The authors [Vaulina, 2010] pay a great attention to forming culture-oriented competence. This allows the teacher to involve Literature as an integral part in the national culture of the target language. Thus, the aesthetic sense is formed in the field of artistic expression on a par with the other forms of art. This relationship is further strengthened by the fact that the text is not only read, but also is listened to in the actor's performance. This additional instrument for the perception eliminates errors in understanding the author's text encoding. Properly placed accents, the tempo of reading constitute additional aids to facilitate more effective implementation of the dialogic function of the work of art.    CONCLUSION    Using an integrative approach in English teaching is advantageously carried out in the subject area "Literature". In this case, students are actively involved in the cultural environment. The language which is the tool for the perception of the work of art allows to aware the specifics of the author's artistic method and some specific features of the national culture. For example, "meeting" with the Hemingway's world of America it's important to demonstrate the importance of the iceberg theory to reflect the idea of the text. But to show the peculiarities of this method is possible only by analyzing the piece in its original. The ability to build a culture relationship, form the reader discourse is made directly with the process of involving the students into the national environment. And the language as the inseparable part of it is the author's tool for encoding the text.    ACKNOWLEDGEMENT    The work is performed according to the Russian Government Program of Competitive Growth of Kazan Federal University.
