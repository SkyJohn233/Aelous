Tesla premiers Roadster 2.5 at Goodwood Festival of Speed | Tesla UK CHICHESTER, England - Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) will unveil its next-generation sports car to the public this weekend at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. The  Tesla Roadster 2.5  features improvements in design and technology, including a new front fascia, rear diffuser, improved seat comfort, sound dampening and an optional large touch screen navigation system with back-up camera. Improved interior sound reduction techniques, including new front fender liner material, make the cabin even quieter. The Festival of Speed  is the world’s largest motoring garden party – a unique weekend that brings together a heady mix of cars, stars and motor sport ‘royalty’ to create the largest car culture festival worldwide. Held in the immaculate grounds of Goodwood House, this annual hill-climb extravaganza celebrates all things automotive. ‘Goodwood is one of the most beloved motoring events in the world and a highlight of the English summer – so it’s only appropriate that this iconic celebration will be the public launch of the latest Roadster,’ said Cristiano Carlutti, Tesla’s Vice President of European Operations. ‘Absolutely Extraordinary’ Tesla has already become a darling of Britain’s beloved Goodwood, which this spring hosted  the first official UK motor race that included electric vehicles , a competition sanctioned by the UK Motor Sport Association. One of Britian’s most respected motoring correspondents described a recent Roadster stint on a Goodwood hill climb as an  'absolutely extraordinary performance.' UK companies that purchase a Roadster benefit from a 100 percent  Writing Down Allowance , meaning they can deduct the price of the car from their taxable profits. The Roadster is the only sports car that has ever qualified for such a tax incentive in the UK. Roadster drivers park for free and without time limits in various London boroughs, they get four hours of free charging at certain parking sites, and they are exempt from the  Showroom Tax . Tesla launched the new Roadster this week and is delivering to customers now. More than 1,200 current Tesla owners in at least 23 countries have logged over five million electric miles in their Roadsters. Prospective customers can see the Tesla Roadster 2.5 at Goodwood or at the  London showroom at 49-51 Cheval Place in Knightsbridge , near Harrod’s.
