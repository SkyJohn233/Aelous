Man of Steal - Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch Wiki Guide - IGN IGN Logo Open Menu Search In order to get this trophy you must play as Swaine and use his  " Mugshot "  ability to steal an item from an enemy 50 times. You should be able to achieve this by just playing through the post-game automatically. However, if you want to get the trophy fast, just switch to Swaine at the start of the battle and do all out defence so Oliver and Esther don not kill the familiars. Then, steal from every single familiar before switching to all out attack.Â  Was this guide helpful? Previous Next
