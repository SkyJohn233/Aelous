if only black america could work together as well as the nba champion warriors the undefeated yet professor michael eric dyson says black folks are a league not a team the golden state warriors will hold their victory parade in oakland california on tuesday celebrating the franchise s third nba title in four years this season s accomplishment was heralded as the triumph of a great team and teamwork the warriors are a team of stars superstars young players veteran players strong personalities and unique talents they overcame internal issues through teamwork and an intense focus on winning after the final game june 8 a few players hinted that internal pressures and undisclosed distractions had made 2017-18 a particularly vexing campaign yet the warriors survived to win their third title since the 2014-15 season as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of tumultuous 1968 i find myself wondering whether far-flung black america could use the warriors brand of teamwork to achieve a championship in an atmosphere of clickbait self-centeredness and narcissism the civil rights movement was a testament to the bravery of a few and the concerted action of many just as the warriors had their issues there were tensions and rivalries with the movement but the brutality and persistence of white supremacy were often enough to force alliances we ve always had disagreements and scuffles professor michael eric dyson said during a recent conversation we re going to have skirmishes all black people don t have to agree with all black people in order for black people to succeed. we were discussing dyson s new book what truth sounds like robert f. kennedy james baldwin and our unfinished conversation about race in america the book centers on a 1963 conversation between robert f. kennedy and a group of handpicked black celebrities and activists about the smoldering racial tensions in america kennedy became annoyed when his guests offered a no-holds-barred assessment of racism including the kennedys culpability the book s overarching themes were the need to speak truth to white power and the need for white power to listen i told dyson that i felt african-americans spend far too much time persuading the white power structure to listen i used a sports team analogy suggesting it was like tyronn lue the cleveland cavaliers coach going to the golden state locker room before a game and asking warriors coach steve kerr to take his foot off the cavaliers neck why should he they are opponents just as lue worked tirelessly and ultimately unsuccessfully to devise a strategy to defeat the warriors more time and energy is needed to get our own locker room the black team s locker room committed to winning that s because racism is deeply rooted and an omnipresent opponent we must do everything it takes to achieve victory prison reform police accountability and economic justice we must be as committed to the proposition of teamwork toward this end dyson accepted the metaphor of the black team but argued that african-americans are far too diverse and varied to be a single team black folks are a league not a team he said on top of that he argued you have to figure out who s on your team everybody who is your color isn t on your team regardless great teams bolster the nba the majority of franchises are in disarray some teams are talent-laden yet never win some such as the new york knicks the nba s most valuable franchise don t have to win to turn a profit some black teams are like that as well where individual success is valued over collective success the beauty of golden state and before that a franchise like san antonio is understanding the vision of collective gain vs. individual gain i raised the issue of teamwork and great teams with david west the warriors 37-year-old veteran forward west has played 15 nba seasons having come into the league in 2003 west has been with four teams has been in the playoffs but did not win a title until he joined golden state in 2016 he has won two titles with the warriors david west of the golden state warriors poses for a portrait with the larry o brien nba championship trophy after defeating the cleveland cavaliers in game 4 of the 2018 nba finals on june 8 jesse d. garrabrant/nbae via getty images west said the most important element for golden state this season and for successful teams in general was the ability to put aside personal agendas for the time that we are together when we go to practice guys aren t bringing their issues into practice guys aren t bringing their own i m going to do it my way into the group environment. west mentioned the warriors morning music locker-room playlist as a small but poignant example of the give-and-take that forms the backbone of a successful team usually wherever you go the young guys rule the music said west who played with new orleans indiana and san antonio before joining golden state at golden state the distribution of music is generationally diverse from jordan bell the 23-year-old center to west the music is a thread that connects generations and sensibilities you might hear earth wind fire and kool the gang one morning you hear michael jackson another morning and you might hear kodak black the next morning said west talent matters and continuity matters but there are teams that have talent and continuity that do not win on the team or in the movement teamwork requires selflessness and sacrifice that might mean putting oneself in danger or at risk to achieve a greater good each generation of players or activists must decide what is that greater good what is the connective thread the common denominator on the sports team the thread is winning on the black team the thread varies from generation to generation in his book exchanging our country marks the transformation of african identities in the colonial and antebellum south historian michael gomez writes about denmark vesey s insurrection of 1822 when people of african descent born in either africa or the americas coalesced for the purposes of realizing a common objective. gomez pointed out that even free blacks cast their lot with those in legal bondage after sober assessment revealed that their own status was precarious if not illusory in vesey s failed rebellion the unifying element was religion although that ultimately was not enough to overcome social and ethnic differences in 1968 we were unified by the brutality of a deeply racist system determined to sustain itself in 2018 sports and high-profile sports stars making statements and taking stands have become a unifying thread the nfl champion philadelphia eagles largely because of the protest of black players did not go to visit the white house the warriors twice have said they would not attend if invited west said social consciousness seeped into the golden state locker room where there were several conversations over the past two seasons about whether to protest during the playing of the national anthem there were agreements and disagreements but nothing got in the way of the ultimate quest to win a third nba title darius leonard on love loss and second chances read now why major league baseball s rule changes on marijuana matter read now the nfl and colin kaepernick are done with each other read now black people have to give up the notion that we have to be unified in order for us to have progress said dyson we do not. commitment is more crucial than consensus whether achieving an nba title or the endless quest for freedom and justice there must be a commitment to achieve collective victories the warriors parade tuesday their third in four years is a testament to dedication vision and the power of teamwork william c. rhoden the former award-winning sports columnist for the new york times and author of forty million dollar slaves is a writer-at-large for the undefeated contact him at william.rhoden espn.com the crowning of four black women in major pageants defies the legacy that privileges european standards of beauty in the pageant industry for the first time in our collective history four black women have been crowned in each of the major beauty pageant titles miss america miss usa miss teen america and now miss universe the crowning of these women has defied the long standing legacy that privileges european standards of beauty in the pageant industry in 1977 more than 40 years ago miss trinidad and tobago janelle penny commissiong was declared the most beautiful woman in the world when she was crowned the first black miss universe but i didn t know it i was too short to reach the television knob and too young to stay up for prime-time television so i was unaware of commissiong and the way she shattered the glass ceiling of universal beauty standards two years later i found myself in the play area for girls in kindergarten i met a best friend who looks like a brunette barbie doll barbie is the drugstore pop-culture beauty i know the best friend s name is carrie and because my mother does not do the cooking in our house my imagination has a hard time imagining my body in an apron or the role of homemaker like barbie soon after i came to realize that i must have resembled a christie the black barbie doll with skin the shade of a chocolate ribbon these memories of kindergarten kicked up like dust when zozibini tunzi was crowned miss universe on dec. 8 in atlanta she is african her skin is black it collects all the colors of the rainbow and confronts the legacy of colonies in our world tunzi s hair is not a mask of femininity but a crown that frames her regalness her very existence and her role as miss universe are personified as anti-colonial â€“ she defies the scripts of what is normal and subverts the suggested hierarchies of ideal femininity during her win she stated may every little girl see their faces reflected in mine. i grew up in a world where a woman who looks like me with my kind of skin dark and my kind of hair short and tightly coiled was never considered beautiful tunzi said the miss universe 2019 pageant is another example of how popular culture is expanding ideas about beauty beyond industry norms and the legacy of empires my kindergarten self wished i knew of tunzi sooner for generations traditional references to universal beauty standards have privileged european standards that are often associated with race and a history of european countries occupying and claiming other countries as their property privileging lighter skin blond hair longer hair small noses and thin body frames considering that the miss universe corporation described tunzi as a proud advocate for natural beauty i am not sure if the pageant industry plans to be more open to standards of beauty that are inclusive of the global majority hopefully tunzi s win is not an exception to the pageant industry s commitment to expanding beauty norms still her crowning is a clear indication that the pageant industry will interrogate its long-standing commitment to celebrating beauty standards that mirror a eurocentric standard of beauty a change may be near damaris

hbo s watchmen the wound it turns out is the place where the blue light enters apologies to rumi for the bastardization of this lovely quotation it couldn t be helped a god walks into abar gives us several crucial missing pieces before what i imagine will be an epic showdown between the seventh kavalry lady trieu and those remaining who know about the cyclops plan and are determined to thwart it but the best thing about this episode is the story of how angela abar and cal came to be a couple in the first place so let s begin with the love story of the abars and that rumi quotation angela has one giant wound she s lost everyone who she ever cared about her parents were murdered by a viet cong sympathizer-turned-suicide-bomber after the conclusion of the vietnam war which resulted in american statehood for the previously independent country upon learning that she had a grandmother who wanted to raise her angela was left with no place to turn except the orphanage where she was raised because grandmother june died the same day the two were supposed to depart for a new life in tulsa oklahoma and so angela nurses her wounds with state-sanctioned violence/vengeance she becomes a cop distance she doesn t seem to have any friends and control even when a literal god tells her they re going to end up together for 10 years she s incredibly skeptical dr. manhattan then is angela s blue light her salve her reason for allowing herself to be vulnerable to love and to be loved in return he s kind of perfect for her at least on the surface who could possibly be a better match for a woman whose heart keeps getting broken by unpredictable circumstances than a time-bending god who knows about everything before it even happens a time-bending god who knows about everything before it even happens angela abar regina king was a police officer in saigon vietnam before she moved to tulsa oklahoma mark hill/hbo once angela assents to dinner with dr. manhattan and later a full-blown relationship she realizes that his ability to see and experience the future is a downer i m so impressed by the way co-writers jeff jensen and damon lindelof committed to falling down the rabbit hole of what it means to be in a modern relationship with a superhero these romantic entanglements tend to be ultimately unfulfilling for the civilian partner especially if that partner is a woman there s an inherent power imbalance one that i wrote about when discussing luke cage s relationship with claire temple if dr. manhattan can see know and experience everything before it happens angela quickly becomes robbed of her own sense of agency she s in a relationship in which she has no control if you know everything that s going to happen what is there to be afraid of a frustrated angela asks dr. manhattan what is there to risk and so the sacrifice dr. manhattan makes in the name of love is to give up the very thing that makes him well dr. manhattan thanks to a device adrian veidt created with just this situation in mind dr. manhattan gives up the very thing humans seem to be addicted to most power it might be one of the most romantic gestures i ve ever witnessed in a television show the penultimate episode of watchmen directed with stunning tenderness by nicole kassell mirrors dr. manhattan s galaxy brain in that both are running on multiple and concurrent tracks the first the microtrack was the abar relationship now let s zoom out and look at the macro view dr. manhattan wins the vietnam war for the united states at the request of president nixon he turns himself into a 100-foot-tall one-man weapon that lays waste to the viet cong army resulting in vietnam s statehood of course there can be no war without unintended consequences and dr. manhattan is indirectly responsible for the deaths of angela s parents â€” his actions in vietnam provided the motive for the suicide bomber who killed them in one lifetime jon osterman goes from refugee fleeing tyranny to reluctant and regretful agent of american imperialism it s all rather einsteinian woe is dr. manhattan like the rest of the series episode eight carries the through line of watchmen graphic novelist alan moore s skepticism toward the idea of superheroes and the unforeseen havoc their actions create but it also provides a path to redemption one that is paved with love besides learning from the mistakes he made as a boyfriend to laurie blake dr. manhattan comes to similar conclusions about allowing himself to become a hired gun for the u.s. defense department and his remorse for both converge in one person angela dr. manhattan s biggest departure from the god he learns about in the bible he s given as a boy in 1936 may be that he is in fact quite fallible what s more he s capable of regretting his actions it s obvious that dr. manhattan is contrite about his role in the vietnam war in which he becomes the deified equivalent of a nuke i think dr. manhattan is also introspective about his previous relationship with laurie we know how she feels about it thanks to the voicemail message she leaves for him in one of lady trieu s mars phone booths she s been forsaken by a god who was seemingly cold unfeeling and distant even if he was all-powerful he creates an eden on the moon of a planet jupiter that shares a name with laurie s mother sally dr. manhattan it would appear feels bad about the way he left things with his ex if the dr. manhattan who destroyed the viet cong and laurie s heart is old testament blue god then the one who gives up his omniscience for the woman whose life his actions inadvertently destroyed is most certainly new testament but now that he s been sucked into the seventh kavalry s teleporter what will become of tulsa and the country at large can adrian veidt save the world now that it appears to need him again preferably without killing 3 million humans as collateral damage this time stray but maybe important observations soraya nadia

second consecutive month surviving original members philip bailey verdine white and ralph johnson found themselves back in the nation s capital in november the smithsonian s national portrait gallery unveiled a 1978 photo of the group earlier this summer bailey told the undefeated that being honored by the kennedy center ranks among the highest of all the accolades the group has received dating to its infancy founder maurice white who died in 2016 was adamant that the group never sought to be embraced by the masses â€” but rather they would embrace them their music serves as a crockpot of styles ranging from rhythm and blues soul big band and swing to jazz and classical the diversity in their music was reflected in the look of their generations of fans funk exclaimed actor tom hanks when asked about his earliest memories of earth wind fire moments earlier the two-time academy award winner joyfully embraced and chatted with the group s members on the evening s red carpet there isn t a person alive that if earth wind fire are playing in the other room and you don t find yourself grooving along just a little bit on the backbeat â€¦ god bless earth wind fire. i loved dancing to them when i was a young person singing along throughout my lifetime and now my 21-year-old daughter â€” she s more thrilled than i am to be here tonight that kind of impact is amazing said kennedy center president deborah rutter the spectrum of all the music they have brought into their performances but the way they perform them the dance moves the live show it s the full package. throughout the audience couples danced and crooned to one another maybe it was their way of connecting to the music that defined the earliest stages of their relationship or maybe it was that the music if only for a few seconds evaporated any other concerns in their lives had it not been for a full band and backup singers already on stage the crowd itself was ready and willing to take on the responsibility of an impromptu choir everyone knew the words that included house speaker nancy pelosi â€” who received a resounding ovation earlier in the night pelosi from her elevated seat smiled and swayed back and forth while singing along to boogie wonderland. kennedy center honors host ll cool j on earth wind fire i m so happy for earth wind fire they deserve it so much. photo by scott suchman the groove that exists in earth wind fire s dna is difficult to quantify and even harder not to be touched by this was white s vision and why his spirit felt present as the crowd and performers ran through a king s ransom of hit records white s being loomed large it s also worth noting how unusual this moment was for the most part individual singers and songwriters get kennedy center honors earth wind fire is just the fourth musical group to receive one of the most prestigious titles in the arts following the who in 2008 led zeppelin in 2012 and the eagles in 2016 they also are the first african american band to receive the distinction they should ve been honored said musician aaron neville who was in attendance they re a world staple. closing the show out with earth wind fire was both a marathon and inspiring victory lap they received two standing ovations both of which lasted well over a minute with audience members screaming their adoration for bailey white and johnson the show concluded with a karaoke-style session of september with legend nick jonas ne-yo and erivo all having their chance to run through one of the most beloved songs in music history as yet another decade

the series the group plays play eight strangers thrown together in a house real world -style all from different backgrounds and experiences i spoke with braylock milligan and james iii about the new show and their podcast black men can t jump this interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity how have your relationships as performers evolved since you first started working together jerah milligan each time we perform we get a deeper understanding of who we all are as comedians there is an improv element to us with the podcast we re having a conversation and we go on rants but we can read each other we know what types of things are going to push each other s buttons and i think that is what makes it fun and exciting jonathan braylock when astronomy club first started i think one of the joys of being in that group and doing improv was that most of us had done improv primarily with white people that s just the nature of the improv community especially in terms of theaters like the upright citizens brigade it wasn t the first time any of us had improvised with other black people but it was the first time we had gotten to be on a house team with just black people and we were able to make jokes and references that we knew we would get but maybe before when we had made that reference when we were on a team with non-people of color that those people did not get it was so fun but as we evolved we knew each other s personalities more even though we all share this black background we re not a monolith we have different shades and there are different things that james will like he likes terrible movies and i like great movies james iii that s rude we didn t need to say that the movies i like are great too jonathan jerah likes to say that he gets passionate some people might call it anger but that s a stereotype jerah i m a person of the people jonathan james has a lot of joy and he gets really excited about things when he gets excited he does a lot of movement you can t see it on the podcast but he s moving his hands a lot and we re like ok there s james over there. jerah i feel like these friendships haven t been manufactured no one s forcing us to stay together no one s like you got to talk to john and bray every day. i talk to them in the morning before i talk to my own mother and i m cool with that that s not a problem that s fun we re stuck together in a wonderful way and that allows us to do things and say things and bounce around that you may not have been able to in a regular writers room i love snl but those people were put together they don t know what braylock was like when he was growing up i ve heard those stories they don t know what james will watch when he gets home after work i ve seen that and i think that is the beauty of us it s like a fam-fam for real from left to right comedians jerah milligan james iii and jonathan braylock star in astronomy club the sketch show and host the podcast black men can t jump viktor erik emanuel there s a comfort among you guys when it comes to the ways that you make fun of yourselves i m thinking of the sketch where you guys ostracize braylock for being light-skinned jerah he fine he ll be all right jonathan i love that we get to play with perceptions of ourselves and maybe even our own insecurities or fears of other people s perceptions of us in our comedy because one none of us take ourselves too seriously even though i am the leader jerah here we go this is happening on an interview jonathan no i mean you have to be able to joke about that stuff because as human beings â€” none of us are perfect we all make mistakes we all have things about ourselves that we like or would like to improve and if you can t have that self-awareness of yourself i don t know how effective you can really be calling out society or other people or culture james whatever it is that s going on with us and the faults that we may have we re in this business that is such a public and such a present thing that if we don t talk about those things somebody else will jonathan true james you have to beat them to the punch and if we don t put it out there that way we could crack underneath the weight of our own self jerah i am perfectly perfect as a human but what i do is i relate to the people i like to pretend like i know what folks are when people see me they think i m relatable to them because i m one of them it s really just a deep mind game that you just have to figure out what should i make fun of to be relatable to other people james but all of it is a lie you re saying jerah jerah listen i didn t say it was a lie what i said it was a part of the system to get people to understand i m part of the people you know what i mean it s an inception but for real life you re welcome james wow comedians jerah milligan jonathan braylock and james iii star in astronomy club and host the podcast black men can t jump. viktor erik emanuel i feel like sketch comedy and improv attracts a very specific type of weirdo jonathan sketch is a fun way to do a lot of different things you can explore a lot of different characters you can explore a lot of different types of comedy and talk about a lot of different subject matter because that s the nature of sketch we have sketches in which we get to play famous characters in movies like the magical negro rehab and then there are times where we get to play ourselves there s one where i get to be a vampire so all of that is superfun and we get to make commentary on different things you guys have managed not to get sucked into the endless vortex of politics was that a deliberate decision and if so why jerah some of our teammates are from canada some are from the suburbs some are from the hood and it s hard to have a unique voice on politics almost every type of comedy form is talking about politics and unless you re going to come into that space and say something drastically different then why do it why would i want to talk about that dude who s racist i don t want to give that guy more attention there s so many things we can do to make ourselves look better again we can make fun of braylock for being light-skinned that is a black community thing we can talk about cooking chitlins and things like that because that s for us i don t want to talk about something that is only affecting us in a negative light it s like for what it doesn t serve any purpose james that just was never the lane that we were in as a group jonathan sometimes it feels like when people of color do comedy they have to talk about politics you have to talk about race we say this on our podcast all the time why can t we also just do funny for funny s sake we are goofy too we can do silly faces we can have jokes that don t have a political agenda behind them from left jonathan braylock james iii shawtane bowen jerah milligan caroline martin keisha zollar monique moses and ray cordova in a scene from astronomy club. courtesy of netflix what have you learned from caroline keisha and monique james caroline is a person who will admit her upbringing was more white than black it s so fascinating because she will be learning slang phrases on set or when we give her a script what is so interesting is her kindness when it comes to checking me on things that i ve said i try my best to not be offensive or sexist but there are certain things that men have learned that we don t even know contributes to sexism caroline is really good about being like hey you got to cut that out. and keisha s really good about it too she will tell you i m not doing that that s racist that makes no sense. mo is interesting because she comes from canada so her racial experience is different than what my upbringing is here in america i am the world is black and white where she s like no i understand that but there is this gray area here that we have to be understanding about. she s good about trying to see things from all aspects is there an example james i remember when we were writing the netflix show we would have people read certain parts and then caroline was like hey i m noticing that you guys keep making me the girlfriend or love interest it may be more important to see a woman with darker skin in some of these parts. that was something that she said not something that mo had to come out with or keisha she s like no man we should make sure that people are seeing black women in all different types of parts on this show and that s kind of what we made sure to do going forward from that point jerah there was a lot of care when working with them and making sure that the female voices of the team aren t squandered or pushed aside because i do think that them being black women in comedy it was very important that they were like we are here we are not going anywhere. keisha taught me to speak my mind on stage she will say whatever the fâ€” comes to her mind i ve always looked up to that and i ve always admired that monique is such a celebratory performer and i learned to celebrate not only myself as an individual but me as a black man to celebrate that while i m on stage or working with her caroline is one of the greatest character performers i ve ever seen what i look up to about her is how to really be big really go for that character those three are fantastic is anything off-limits jerah the first thing that comes to my mind is i think a lot about the unarmed black people being shot thing and i specifically remember a conversation with jerah about this sketch that i was working on that s about a new toy that s being marketed to black kids that s a new superhero and it s a white guy who is a superhero he can t get shot he can reach for his wallet and he ll be fine i remember talking to jerah about this and he would say i don t think talking about unarmed black people being shot is funny even if the butt of the joke is something else. it s not off-limits to me but it s precious and needs to be taken care of and i remember that discussion with jerah as being very important because it made me think about am i sending the wrong message jonathan as a comedian i think any subject should be able to be tackled and satirized and viewed through a comedy lens am i the right person to tackle that subject for a lot of matters i probably am not i just don t have the experience the knowledge perspective the pov to tackle certain issues i wouldn t say it s off-limits to me because perhaps i could collaborate with somebody who can fill in those gaps i wouldn t tackle certain subject matters like say relating to lgbtq or women s issues or other people of color like the asian community or the middle eastern community because i m not a part of that community jerah i can t make fun of trans people that makes no goddamn sense no matter what angle i come to i m not a part of that community i should not be making fun of a community that i m not in it s just disrespectful to me and every time someone s like i can say what i want. no you re an idiot you are personally refusing to change because you don t want to and that is a problem that we have james i think that there s a dangerous saying that people throw around it s funny is funny. it s dangerous because funny is also subjective and also what is funny to you is not necessarily going to be funny to me people would say that it s ok but because we have such a large platform to put our voices out there and we should be careful we should be cognizant of what we re saying how is it going to land it really just sounds like good manners jerah treat humans how you want to be treated it s so simple jonathan if you have the privilege of speaking to large audiences at once you should be responsible with that privilege sometimes people forget not everybody gets to have a show not everybody gets to have a comedy special there s an artistic responsibility to do the best art and comedy
