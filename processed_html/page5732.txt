There is evidence for both homomeric and heteromeric H-NS &# x02013;StpA complexes. The two proteins show differential turnover, and StpA was previously found to be subject to protease-mediated degradation by the Lon protease. We investigated which regions of the H-NS protein are able to prevent degradation of StpA. A set of truncated H-NS derivatives was tested for their ability to mediate StpA stability and to form heteromers in vitro. The data indicate that H-NS interacts with StpA at two regions and that the presence of at least one of the H-NS regions is necessary for StpA stability. Our results also suggest that a proteolytically stable form of StpA, StpA F21C , forms dimers, whereas wild-type StpA in the absence of H-NS predominantly forms tetramers or oligomers, which are more susceptible to proteolysis. The H-NS protein of  Escherichia coli  is a major component of the bacterial nucleoid and has been shown to affect several cellular processes, such as gene expression, recombination, transposition, and phage transposition (reviewed in references  1  and  24 ). The H-NS protein binds DNA in a relatively nonspecific manner but with some preference for curved sequences, and high overexpression of H-NS causes a detrimental compaction of the chromosome ( 3 ,  6 ,  20 ,  21 ,  26 ). The H-NS protein negatively regulates expression from the cryptic  bgl  operon, probably by binding to an AT-rich nucleation site near the  bgl  promoter where a nucleoprotein complex is formed. The site extends over the  bgl  promoter and thereby abolishes expression ( 16 ). An H-NS paralogue, StpA, has 58 &# x00025; identity to H-NS and is able to functionally substitute for H-NS in several cases, although it also displays unique properties of its own ( 19 ,  27 ,  28 ). Recent findings suggest that H-NS and StpA stimulate the expression of stringently regulated genes by their effect on local DNA topology ( 10 ). The extensive identity between H-NS and StpA suggests that they are able to form heteromers, and Williams et al. ( 25 ) were able to cross-link StpA with the 64 N-terminal amino acids of H-NS. Functionally, the interaction between the StpA protein and the H-NS 64  peptide was important for silencing of the  bgl  operon, and the StpA protein was suggested to function as a molecular adapter ( 7 ). Recently, we found that the StpA protein, in the absence of H-NS, was susceptible to Lon protease proteolysis, whereas StpA was stable in the presence of H-NS ( 12 ). This suggests that StpA is present mainly in heteromeric form with H-NS in the cell. In this study, we investigated what parts of H-NS are able to mediate StpA stability. We present evidence that the protease-susceptible wild-type StpA protein (StpA wt ) forms tetramers and oligomers in the absence of H-NS, whereas the stable mutant protein StpA F21C  predominantly forms dimers. The strains used in this study were described before ( 11 ,  12 ): BSN26 (MC4100  trp ::Tn 10 ), BSN27 (MC4100  trp ::Tn 10 ,  &# x00394; hns ), BSN29 (MC4100  trp ::Tn 10 &# x00394; hns stpA60 ::Km r ), JGJ212 (MC4100  zfi-3143 ::Tn 10  Km r  StpA wt ), JGJ213 (MC4100  zfi-3143 ::Tn 10  Km r  StpA F21C ), JGJ214 (MC4100  zfi-3143 ::Tn 10  Km r  StpA wt  hns ::Cm r ), JGJ215 (MC4100  zfi-3143 ::Tn 10  Km r  StpA F21C  hns ::Cm r ), JGJ221 ( &# x00394; hns ), and JGJ223 ( &# x00394; hns lon ). The different strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium ( 2 ) at 37 &# x000b0;C with vigorous shaking (220 rpm). Growth was monitored by measuring Klett units on a Klett-Summerson colorimeter, where 50 Klett units corresponds approximately to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.4. Where necessary, the following antibiotics (Sigma) were used: carbenicillin, 50  &# x003bc;g/ml; kanamycin, 25 or 50  &# x003bc;g/ml; spectinomycin, 100  &# x003bc;g/ml; and tetracycline, 7.5  &# x003bc;g/ml. Plates containing 40  &# x003bc;g of the chromogen  &# x003b2;-glucoside 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- &# x003b2;- d -glucopyranoside (Sigma)/ml were used to monitor the Bgl phenotype expressed by the different  hns  deletion derivatives. Activity of the  bgl  operon was determined by the color of single colonies, where blue colonies represent full derepression. Molecular genetic manipulations were performed essentially as described elsewhere ( 15 ). Primer  hns -up2 (5 &# x02032;-CCCGAATTCCCTCAACAAACC-3 &# x02032;), binding upstream of the  hns  gene and containing an  Eco RI restriction enzyme site, was used together with either primer  hns - &# x00394;60 (5 &# x02032;-TTATCAATATTGCTGCAGCTTACG-3 &# x02032;), coding for the first 60 amino acids, primer  hns - &# x00394;80c (5 &# x02032;-TTATCAACGTTCGTTCGTTAACGACAAC-3 &# x02032;), coding for the first 80 amino acids, or primer 8 (5 &# x02032;-CAAATAAAGCAAATAAAG-3 &# x02032;), binding downstream of the  hns  gene and thereby coding for a full-length H-NS protein. These three primer combinations were used on a wild-type  hns  sequence (pHMG409) ( 9 ), creating pJOB101 (wild type), pJOB103 (N60), and pJOB104 (N80), respectively. Furthermore, primer  hns -up2, together with either primer  hns - &# x00394;80 or primer 8, was used on a construct lacking an  Nru I fragment of the  hns  sequence, creating an in-frame deletion of 21 codons; the resulting constructs were named pJOB105 (N80 &# x00394;39 &# x02013;60) and pJOB107 ( &# x00394;39 &# x02013;60), respectively. The QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create the amino acid substitution mutant C21F (pJOB108), containing a phenylalanine instead of a cysteine at position 21. Wild-type plasmid (pJOB101) was used as the template. Primers hns-O (5 &# x02032;-GCGCAGGCAAGAGAATTCACACTTGAAACGCTGG-3 &# x02032;) and hns-U (5 &# x02032;-CCAGCGTTTCAAGTGTGAATTCTCTTGCCTGCGC-3 &# x02032;) were used to create the desired base pair substitution. The PCR fragments were digested with  Eco RI, cloned into the  Eco RI/ Sma I site of pCL1921 ( 13 ), and then sequenced. Subsequently, the constructs were digested with  Eco RI/ Bam HI and cloned into the  Eco RI/ Bam HI site of the IPTG (isopropyl- &# x003b2;- d -thiogalactopyranoside)-inducible plasmid pMMB66EH ( 8 ). Strains BSN26, BSN27, and BSN29 were transformed with the constructs. In order to analyze the presence and stability of the truncated versions of H-NS, strains containing the different constructs were grown to 50 Klett units in the presence of 10 &# x02212;5  M IPTG, and protein synthesis was inhibited by the addition of 100 mg of spectinomycin/ml. Extracts were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and silver staining, and the constructs were found to be stable (see Fig.  &# x200B; Fig.1B). 1 B). These results are in keeping with the finding by Ueguchi et al. ( 22 ), who found that several truncated forms of H-NS are stable. Bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The different samples were subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE (10, 15, or 20 &# x00025; polyacrylamide). For immunoblot detection the gel was blotted onto a 0.2-mm-pore-size polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Bio-Rad) by use of a semidry blotting apparatus. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against StpA was used as the primary antibody. Further visualization and quantification were done using chemifluorescent detection as described previously ( 11 ) or using the ECL-plus kit as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia). All data are averages of at least two independent experiments. To determine the intracellular stability of the StpA and H-NS proteins, we followed a previously described method ( 12 ). Protein stability was monitored after the protein synthesis had been inhibited by the addition of spectinomycin (100  &# x003bc;g ml &# x02212;1 ) to bacterial cultures grown to 50 Klett units in LB medium containing 10 &# x02212;5  M IPTG at 37 &# x000b0;C. Samples to be analyzed by Western blotting were removed at various time points. The peptides were cross-linked with dimethyl suberimidate (DMS; Sigma) by a method described by Ueguchi et al. ( 23 ). Cells for cross-linking were harvested from 5 ml of the culture, washed with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and subsequently freeze-thawed in the same buffer. Thereafter, the cells were resuspended in cross-linking buffer (1 M triethanolamine-HCl  &# x0005b;pH 8.5 &# x0005d;, 0.25 M NaCl, and 5 mM dithiothreitol). The cell extracts were sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000  &# x000d7;  g  for 30 min, and the supernatants were incubated at room temperature without or with DMS (1 mg ml &# x02212;1 ). After incubation for 30 or 60 min, the samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE buffer. In a previous study we showed that the StpA protein was unstable in the absence of H-NS, whereas it remained stable in the presence of H-NS ( 12 ). In order to get further insight into the molecular interactions between H-NS and StpA, we wanted to analyze what regions of the H-NS protein mediated this stability. To do so, genes encoding truncated versions of H-NS (Fig.  &# x200B; (Fig.1A) 1 A) were constructed (see Materials and Methods) and cloned behind an IPTG-inducible  tac  promoter. Since the StpA protein is unstable in the absence of H-NS, the protein stability experiment was performed in the  hns  strain (BSN27) containing plasmid constructs encoding the truncated versions of the  hns  gene. The strains were grown to 50 Klett units in LB medium containing 10 &# x02212;5  M IPTG prior to the addition of spectinomycin, and samples were removed at various time points. The results (Fig.  &# x200B; (Fig.2) 2 ) clearly demonstrated that strains containing the pJOB101 (wild type), pJOB103 (N60), pJOB104 (N80), and pJOB107 ( &# x00394;39 &# x02013;60) plasmids retained similar levels of StpA 160 min after the addition of spectinomycin. In the case of the N80 peptide there was some reduction, but levels of at least 50 &# x00025; were retained after 160 min. This suggests that these H-NS peptides were able to prevent proteolysis of StpA. In contrast, strains containing the vector plasmid or the construct pJOB105 (N80 &# x00394;39 &# x02013;60) did not contain detectable levels of StpA 160 min after the addition of spectinomycin, indicating that these plasmids were unable to prevent StpA proteolysis.     Previously, we showed that a single amino acid change (phenylalanine to cysteine at position 21  &# x0005b;Fig.  1 C &# x0005d;) within StpA made the protein stable ( 12 ). Interestingly, a cysteine is present at that position in H-NS, and to test if this particular residue was essential for the stability of H-NS and/or for the interaction between H-NS and StpA we constructed an inducible plasmid (pJOB108) that encoded an H-NS protein with an amino acid change from cysteine to phenylalanine at position 21 (see Materials and Methods). When tested in a stability experiment (using strain BSN27/pJOB108), the H-NS C21F  mutant protein was as stable as the wild-type protein (data not shown). As seen in Fig.  &# x200B; Fig.2 2  (lanes 13 and 14), the H-NS C21F  protein was still able to prevent proteolysis of StpA under the conditions tested. A possible explanation for the stabilization of StpA by the N60, N80, and  &# x00394;39 &# x02013;60 H-NS constructs would be that the StpA protein could directly interact with the H-NS polypeptides and thereby be protected from Lon-mediated proteolysis. In order to test this hypothesis, we grew the  hns  strain (BSN27) containing plasmid constructs encoding the truncated versions of the  hns  gene to 50 Klett units in LB medium containing 10 &# x02212;5  M IPTG, prior to performing a cross-linking experiment. Protein extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as shown in Fig.  &# x200B; Fig.3. 3 . Half of the samples were exposed to DMS, whereas the other half were untreated (Materials and Methods). The results clearly suggested that strains containing pJOB101, pJOB103, pJOB104, pJOB107, or pJOB108 produced H-NS polypeptides able to interact and cross-link with StpA as heterodimers. The results of experiments illustrated in Fig.  &# x200B; Fig.2 2  and  &# x200B; and3 3  suggest that H-NS interacts with StpA at two separate domains, one situated in the middle portion and the other located in the C terminus of the H-NS protein. Also, the prevention of StpA proteolysis requires at least one of these domains.   Interestingly, whereas both the wild type and the  &# x00394;39 &# x02013;60 peptide, seemed to  &# x0201c;trap &# x0201d; the StpA protein in a dimer conformation (Fig.  &# x200B; (Fig.3, 3 , lane 8 and 12), the N60 and the N80 peptides could mediate such trapping only partially. Instead, several bands migrating more slowly appeared in these wells (Fig.  &# x200B; (Fig.3, 3 , lane 2 and 4). We believe that these bands are oligomeric forms of StpA (tetramers and oligomers). The relative amounts of multimeric forms appeared to differ somewhat between different constructs. Shorter cross-linking treatments emphasized the difference, and an example is shown by N80 (in comparison with its vector control) in Fig.  &# x200B; Fig.3, 3 , lanes 16 to 18. The N80-StpA heterodimer was evidently the multimer present in most significant quantity. In contrast, the N80 &# x00394;39 &# x02013;60 peptide was not able to form heterodimers with StpA. In this case the StpA protein formed predominantly oligomers, with some dimer formation as well (Fig.  &# x200B; (Fig.3, 3 , lane 6). Previous results showed that the Lon protease was involved in the turnover of StpA ( 12 ). It was therefore of interest to find out if StpA formed dimers or larger oligomers in a  lon hns  mutant strain. Samples of strains JGJ221 ( hns lon &# x0002b; ) and JGJ223 ( hns lon ) were accordingly subjected to cross-linking tests as described above. As shown in Fig.  &# x200B; Fig.3, 3 , lanes 19 to 24, there was no indication of increased StpA dimer formation in the  lon  mutant derivative but the majority of StpA seemed to be present in relatively large oligomers. Free et al. ( 7 ) reported results suggesting that the StpA protein was able to function as a molecular adapter for an H-NS protein lacking DNA-binding function in the repression of the  bgl  operon. Intriguingly, Ohta et al. ( 14 ) could not repeat that experiment, but as discussed by those authors ( 14 ), this anomaly may be due to different strain backgrounds, since Free et al. ( 7 ) used an MC4100 derivative whereas Ohta et al. ( 14 ) used a CSH26 background. We wanted to analyze our truncated H-NS derivatives for their ability to repress  bgl  expression and therefore used three different strains derived from MC4100, a wild-type (BSN26), an  hns  (BSN27), and an  hns stpA  (BSN29) strain containing our constructs. As seen in Table  &# x200B; Table1, 1 , the results indicate that the heterodimers formed between StpA and the H-NS derivatives in the  hns  strain (BSN27) were also able to repress  bgl  expression. The results also suggest that StpA is able to function as a molecular adapter for truncated H-NS, since no repression of the  bgl  expression could be monitored in an  hns stpA  strain (Table  &# x200B; (Table1). 1 ).   In this context we also note that  bgl  expression was not repressed in the  hns lon  mutant strain (JGJ223) as judged by tests on indicator plates. Our previous finding that the StpA F21C  protein was proteolytically stable, even in the absence of H-NS ( 12 ), prompted us to compare the ability of StpA wt  and StpA F21C  to multimerize. To investigate this, we used both  hns &# x0002b;  and  hns  mutant strains containing either  stpA wt  or the  stpA F21C  allele. The strains were grown to 50 Klett units in LB medium before they were subjected to cross-linking experiments with DMS (Materials and Methods). In the presence of H-NS, both StpA wt  and StpA F21C  predominantly formed heterodimers together with H-NS (Fig.  &# x200B; (Fig.4A, 4 A, lanes 2 and 4), since no oligomers could be detected under such conditions. However, in the absence of H-NS, the proteolytically unstable StpA wt  protein predominantly formed oligomers (Fig.  &# x200B; (Fig.4A, 4 A, lane 6). Quantitative measurements showed that more than 60 &# x00025; of the StpA wt  protein was present as oligomers and about 20 &# x00025; each was present as monomers and dimers (Fig.  &# x200B; (Fig.4B). 4 B). Interestingly, only a small fraction ( &# x0003c;10 &# x00025;) of the stable StpA F21C  protein formed oligomers in the absence of H-NS. Instead, most of the StpA F21C  protein was detected as monomers and dimers after cross-linking (Fig.  &# x200B; (Fig.4A, 4 A, lane 8, and 4B).   In this work we compared the multimerizing ability of the StpA wt  and StpA F21C  proteins. Our results suggest that in the absence of H-NS, the StpA wt  protein forms dimers to a much lesser extent than the StpA F21C  protein, which traps the StpA molecule in a dimeric form. Instead, most of the StpA wt  can be found as oligomers (tetramers and oligomers) (Fig.  &# x200B; (Fig.4). 4 ). The results of this study (Fig.  &# x200B; (Fig.3 3  and  &# x200B; and4) 4 ) together with earlier findings ( 12 ) suggest the following model (Fig.  &# x200B; (Fig.5). 5 ). The StpA wt  protein is unable to form stable dimers and instead forms oligomers that are susceptible to degradation by the Lon protease. In contrast, the StpA F21C  protein predominantly forms stable dimers, which are not degraded. The StpA F21C  protein has probably undergone a conformational change revealing a dimerization site that is normally  &# x0201c;masked &# x0201d; in StpA wt  but is available in H-NS.   Our results also suggest that the StpA protein is largely protected from proteolysis in the presence of three truncated H-NS derivatives (Fig.  &# x200B; (Fig.2) 2 ) and that the protection is mediated by a direct interaction between the StpA protein and the H-NS peptide (Fig.  &# x200B; (Fig.3). 3 ). We also show evidence demonstrating that such an interaction functionally represses  bgl  expression in a strain lacking normal H-NS (Table  &# x200B; (Table1). 1 ). The present data suggest that the H-NS protein is able to interact with the StpA protein at two distinct domains, one situated between amino acids 39 and 60 and the other located between amino acid 80 and the C terminus (Fig.  &# x200B; (Fig.1C). 1 C). Previous reports have also identified C-terminally deleted H-NS as being able to interact with StpA ( 7 ,  25 ) and to repress  bgl  expression in the presence of StpA ( 7 ). However, we also show here that an H-NS molecule lacking the middle portion of the protein is still able to interact with, and prevent degradation of, StpA. This StpA- &# x00394;39 &# x02013;60 complex can also repress  bgl  expression in the absence of H-NS. Previously, the oligomerization domain of H-NS has been suggested to reside within the N-terminal or middle portion of the protein, whereas the C-terminal part has been suggested to mediate DNA binding ( 18 ,  22 ,  24 ). Williams et al. ( 25 ) discussed the possibility of an alteration of the nucleic acid binding after heteromerization between H-NS and StpA. Our results do not contradict this, but they may indeed indicate a possible difference between H-NS &# x02013;H-NS homomerization and H-NS &# x02013;StpA heteromerization. Perhaps the C-terminal interaction between H-NS and StpA alters the DNA-binding ability of the proteins and thereby causes a change in the DNA motif recognized. The physiological roles of different H-NS &# x02013;StpA complexes are not yet known. The findings that there are both differential expression and turnover of the proteins suggest that levels of homomeric and heteromeric complexes can be regulated ( 12 ,  19 ). Furthermore, it will be of interest to find out if other proteins with similarities to H-NS in the C-terminal domain ( 5 ) might also be involved in complex formation with H-NS and/or StpA.

Analysis of stability of the StpA protein. The level of StpA was measured in an  hns  mutant strain (BSN27) expressing different H-NS derivatives encoded on plasmids pJOB101 (lanes 11 and 12), pJOB103 (lanes 1 and 2), pJOB104 (lanes 3 and 4), pJOB105 (lanes 5 and 6), pJOB107 (lanes 7 and 8), and pMMB66EH (lanes 9 and 10). These strains were grown to 50 Klett units in LB medium containing 10 &# x02212;5  M IPTG, and protein synthesis was subsequently inhibited by the addition of spectinomycin. Samples were removed at indicated time points. Processing and Western blotting were performed as described in Materials and Methods. Interaction between StpA and different H-NS derivatives. Chemical cross-linking was performed with an  hns  mutant strain (BSN27) expressing different H-NS derivatives encoded on plasmids pJOB101 (lanes 11 and 12), pJOB103 (lanes 1 and 2), pJOB104 (lanes 3, 4, 15, and 16), pJOB105 (lanes 5 and 6), pJOB107 (lanes 7 and 8), and pMMB66EH (lanes 9, 10, 17, and 18). BSN27 strains were grown to 50 Klett units in LB medium containing 10 &# x02212;5  M IPTG prior to sampling and cross-linking with DMS (Materials and Methods). Positions of different presumed StpA forms were revealed by Western blotting using anti-StpA antisera. Cross-linking experiments with strains JGJ221 (lanes 19, 20, and 23) and JGJ223 (lanes 21, 22, and 24) were performed to test how a  lon  mutation might influence StpA multimer formation. The strains were grown in LB medium, and samples were subjected to DMS treatment as in the case of BSN27 derivatives. Lanes 1 to 14 show results from 60-min DMS treatment, and lanes 15 to 24 show results from 30-min DMS treatment.
