3 email updates: Double opt-in and more! - Podia New year, new improvements to our email marketing tools! Just letting you know about a few new improvements we’ve made to Podia’s email marketing tools: Double opt-in (new default option) All landing pages and email capture embed forms now feature a “Double opt-in” mechanism as a default. This means if someone signs up for your offer, he/she will have to confirm his/her email address before receiving it (or being added to your list). If you’d like to go back to “Single opt-in” (meaning new subscribers do NOT have to confirm their email addresses), you can do so in your Settings tab. Check out this FAQ  for more details and to learn how to change the new default setting. Send email from your own custom domain Do you want to send emails from your custom domain such as spencerfry.com? You can now do this! To set it up,  read our guide here . Just FYI, you must be on a paid plan (either Mover, Shaker, or Earthquaker) to send emails from your custom domain. Anti-SPAM compliance Before sending emails (newsletters or drips), you must confirm your email address and add your physical mailing address in order to comply with anti-SPAM laws. Next time you create a new email, simply click the link that says, “Before we can send your emails, we need your mailing address to comply with anti-SPAM laws.” Just a reminder… At the end of January, we  added these 5 new features : If you have any questions or feedback regarding these new updates, leave a comment below or email us at  hello@Podia.com .
