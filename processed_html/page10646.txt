XD wheels based out of California initially began producing steel wheels in 1982, then technology advanced and their wheels did as well and are now made of cast aluminum. XD Wheels feature a variety of aggressive spoke designs, complemented with a variety of finishes, from Matte Black to Chrome, and many complemented with machined and milled accents. XD has also added Dually Wheels for those large trucks. XD is not only an industry leader in aftermarket wheels, but also a leader and proud sponsor of multiple races and drivers, including Ricky Johnson, Carl Renezeder, Bryce Menzies, Corry Weller, and Travis Pastrana. The bottom line is that XD wheels have a great history, pedigree and sure do make good looking wheels. XD makes their wheels out of aluminum alloy, this creates a lighter and stronger wheel. A lighter wheel means less overall weight and better gas mileage, it also means that it will be easier on your brakes. Both of these points are magnified as trucks are lifted and wheels and tires become larger. XD Rims are built to withstand even the most extreme terrain, being battled tested at the Baja 1000. XD Series Rims are offered in all of the latest trending designs including simulated beadlock (also known as streetlock) and stunning machined finishes that will knock your socks off.
