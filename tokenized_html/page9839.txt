standards act as well as aspects of ontario s labour relations act the brief draws on findings of closing the employment standards enforcement gap improving protections for people in precarious jobs based on primary research evidence from other jurisdictions and secondary scholarly literature and policy analysis the interim report of the changing workplace review released on july 26 2016 sets out four options for reforming the personal emergency leave pel provisions of the employment standards act and is seeking public input on the alternatives posed prepared by researchers affiliated with the research partnership closing the enforcement gap improving protections for people in precarious jobs this research brief responds to this call for input drawing upon both preliminary findings of our research evidence from other jurisdictions and scholarly literature and policy analysis on the subject of pel growing evidence shows that the employment standards act is failing to provide a floor of rights for ontario s employees leaving many people vulnerable to many types of violations in our first research note we explore five reasons why improving employment standards enforcement matters for all of us thomas mark leah f. vosko eric tucker mercedes steedman andrea m. noack john grundy mary gellatly and lisa leinveer fall 2019 the employment standards enforcement gap and the overtime pay exemption in ontario. labour/le travail 84 25-53 employment standards es legislation sets minimum terms and conditions of employment in areas such as wages working time vacations and leaves and termination and severance es legislation is designed to provide minimum workplace protections in particular for those with little bargaining power in the labour market in practice however es legislation includes ways in which legislated standards may be avoided including through exemptions that exclude specified employee groups fully or partially from legislative coverage with a focus on the ontario employment standards act this paper develops a case study of exemptions to the overtime pay provision of the act and regulations and examines in closer detail three particular areas in which exemptions apply through this study of the overtime pay exemption the system of exemptions is presented as a contradictory approach to the regulation of es that in effect reduces es coverage contributes to the avoidance of key legislated standards and undermines the goal of providing protection for workers in precarious jobs vosko leah f. eric tucker and rebecca casey enforcing employment standards for temporary migrant agricultural workers in ontario canada exposing underexplored layers of vulnerability. 2019 international journal of comparative labour law and industrial relations 35 2 227-254 over 50,000 migrant agricultural workers are employed in canada each year almost half of whom are destined for the province of ontario these workers are among the most vulnerable in the country and therefore most in need of labour and employment law protection one important source of employment rights in ontario is the employment standards act esa which establishes basic minimum entitlements in areas such as wages working time and vacations and leaves drawing on an analysis of the ontario ministry of labour s mol s employment standards information system esis a previously untapped administrative data source containing information on all of ontario s employment standards es enforcement activities and their outcomes this article investigates the enforcement of es among migrant agricultural workers after offering a few methodological caveats the analysis unfolds in three parts beginning in part i by setting the stage with a discussion of the layers of vulnerability that combine to construct migrant agricultural workers as an extreme case against this backdrop part ii describes agricultural workers limited entitlements under the esa and the act s complaint-based enforcement regime which produces for workers in general a gap between rights on the books and in practice part iii then looks more specifically at es enforcement among agricultural workers focusing where possible on the situation of those that are migrants and illustrating how a complaint-based enforcement regime and an under resourced and poorly targeted inspectorate is ill-suited to the realization of rights among this group mirchandani kiran and sheldon bromfield 2019 roundabout wage theft the limits of regulatory protections for ontario workers in precarious jobs. journal of labor and society volume unavailable 1-17 this article focuses on wage theft experienced by workers in precarious jobs in ontario canada workers report that employers utilize subtle forms of wage theft which one respondent in this study described as roundabout wage theft we argue that the enforcement of the employment standards act requires not only action on overt wage theft but also a proactive approach which challenges employers subtle practices which result in wage theft we highlight two sets of practices resulting in wage theft although these may not always in themselves represent violations of the law first employers use discourses of futurity where promises of future work or payment are evoked to deter employee action on unpaid wages second employers set up confusing payment structures which mask unpaid wages as difficult-to-detect errors mirchandani kiran mary jean hande and shelley condratto 2019 complaints-based entrepreneurialism worker experiences of the employment standards complaints process in ontario canada. the canadian review of sociology 56 3 347-367 in ontario workers who face unfair working conditions have the option of filing an official complaint with the ministry of labour complaints making is characterized as a widely available easily accessible and free-of-cost avenue for workers who may have experienced a violation of the law however interviews with ontario workers who have filed complaints tell a different story this paper is based on a community-university project on the enforcement of the employment standards act in ontario we draw on 36 interviews with workers employed in precarious jobs in sudbury toronto and windsor who filed complaints to the ministry workers characterize the complaints process as rife with bureaucratic complexity risk and unsuccessful payouts their experiences shed light on the efficacy of complaint-based approaches that are often promoted as a form of bottom-up enforcement of employment standards es we demonstrate that the current es complaints system requires workers to enact neoliberal entrepreneurialism rather than agentic or collective entrepreneurialism creating a highly stressful enormously time-consuming and demoralizing experience we document the increasingly individualized and contradictory avenues through which workers must act as entrepreneurs to navigate and self-advocate when their rights have been violated we argue that the current complaint processes limit the potentially empowering impact of this strategy hande mary jean hande ayesha mian akram and shelley condratto journal of international migration and integration not yet assigned volume issue june 2019 prior to entering canadian workplaces immigrants generally expect strong legislative protections based on canada s global reputation for equity and equality as reported by hardwick and mansfield annals of the association of american geographers 99 2 383-405 2009 however after exposure to poor working conditions employment standards es violations and challenges with filing claims for recompense immigrant workers perceptions of work in canada often diminish significantly although scholars have explored canadian immigrants experiences with unemployment and poor working conditions little research has uncovered the effects of these experiences on their shifting perceptions of canada and their overall experience of adjusting to a new life in canada our narrative data collected in ontario canada reveals 1 the exploitation of immigrant workers perceived limited access to and knowledge of workplace rights and 2 limited access to employment opportunities and protections for immigrant workers these two factors lead to workers diminishing perceptions of canada as they navigate poor working conditions on the precarity track according to goldring and landolt goldring and landolt 2013 this analysis offers insight into the everyday experiences of immigrant workers and the impacts of precarious employment on perceptions of canada vokso leah f. john grundy rebecca casey andrea m. noack and mark p. thomas 2019 canadian labour employment law journal 21 2 267-298 the development of employment standards legislation in ontario has historically been shaped by a tension between the competing goals of establishing a minimum floor of protections for employees and minimizing interference with employers business practices this tension has resulted in the establishment of numerous exemptions from the legislated minimum standards based on the perceived needs of particular industries sectors or occupational groups the growth of the patchwork of exemptions has been accompanied in recent decades by the spread of precarious employment with particular effects on women recent immigrants and young people by examining specific occupations subject to an exemption from or special rule regarding the minimum wage this article reveals the disproportionate costs of exemptions for certain groups of employees through an in-depth look at the cases of homecare employees liquor servers and agricultural employees it demonstrates how exemptions and special rules can exacerbate insecurity for those in occupations characterized by high degrees of precariousness and often otherwise subject to disadvantage in the labour force tucker eric leah f. vosko rebecca casey mark thomas john grundy and andrea m. noack 2019 international journal of comparative labour law 35 1 1â€“30 this article assesses whether a deterrence gap exists in the enforcement of the ontario employment standards act esa which sets minimum conditions of employment in areas such as minimum wage overtime pay and leaves drawing on a unique administrative data set the article measures the use of deterrence in ontario s esa enforcement regime against the role of deterrence within two influential models of enforcement responsive regulation and strategic enforcement the article finds that the use of deterrence is below its prescribed role in either model of enforcement we conclude that there is a deterrence gap in ontario casey rebecca eric tucker leah f. vosko and andrea m. noack 2018 the economic and labour relations review 29 2 228â€“249 it is widely agreed that there is a crisis in labour/employment standards enforcement a key issue is the role of deterrence measures that penalise violations employment standards enforcement in ontario like in most jurisdictions is based mainly on a compliance framework promoting voluntary resolution of complaints and if that fails ordering restitution deterrence measures that penalise violations are rarely invoked however the ontario government has recently increased the role of proactive inspections and tickets a low-level deterrence measure which imposes fines of cad295 plus victim surcharges in examining the effectiveness of the use of tickets in inspections we begin by looking at this development in the broader context of employment standards enforcement and its historical trajectory then using administrative data from the ministry of labour we examine when and why tickets are issued in the course of workplace inspections after demonstrating that even when ticketable violations are detected tickets are issued only rarely we explore factors associated with an increased likelihood of an inspector issuing a ticket finally we consider how the overall deterrent effect of workplace inspections is influenced by the use or non-use of deterrence tools vosko leah f. john grundy and mark p. thomas 2016 economic and industrial democracy 37 2 373â€“398 a mounting crisis in employment standards es enforcement is prompting the adoption of new instruments and mechanisms among governments in common law jurisdictions aiming to improve workplace regulation this shift evident across all stages of the enforcement process indicates the increasing influence of regulatory new governance using reforms in four jurisdictions as illustrative examples this article raises serious cautions around the emergence of regulatory new governance in employment standards enforcement the central argument of the article is that new modes of regulation that fail to account adequately for the power dynamics of the employment relationship risk entrenching processes of regulatory degradation in light of this potential the article outlines four principles for more effective es regulation that aim to balance aspects of traditional regulatory models with a selective application of more promising elements of regulatory new governance in particular participatory arrangements that involve workers in enforcement processes vosko leah f. john grundy eric tucker mark p. thomas andrea m. noack rebecca casey mary gellatly and jennifer mussell 2017 industrial relations journal 48 3 256â€“273 this article critically assesses the compliance model of employment standards enforcement through a study of monetary employment standards violations in ontario canada the findings suggest that in contexts where changes to the organisation of work deepen insecurity for employees models of enforcement that emphasise compliance over deterrence are unlikely to effectively prevent or remedy employment standards violations gellatly mary john grundy kiran mirchandani j. adam perry mark p. thomas and leah f. vosko 2011 the economic and labour relations review 22 2 81â€“106 in october 2010 the provincial government of ontario canada enacted the open for business act oba a central component of the oba is its provisions aiming to streamline the enforcement of ontario s employment standards act esa the oba s changes to the esa are an attempt to manage a crisis of employment standards es enforcement arising from decades of ineffective regulation by entrenching an individualised enforcement model the act aims to streamline enforcement by screening people assumed to be lacking definitive proof of violations out of the complaints process the oba therefore produces a new category of illegitimate claimants and attributes administrative backlogs to these people instead of improving the protection of workers the oba embeds new racialized and gendered modes of exclusion in the es enforcement process vosko leah f. and mark p. thomas 2014 journal of industrial relations 56 5 631â€“652 employment standards es are legislated standards that set minimum terms and conditions of employment in areas such as wages working time vacations and leaves and termination and severance in canada the majority of workers rely on es for basic regulatory protection however a significant enforcement gap exists in the province of ontario this enforcement gap has been exacerbated in recent years due to the deregulation of es through inadequate funding workplace restructuring legislative reforms that place greater emphasis on individualized complaints processes and voluntary compliance and a formal separation of unions from es enforcement the implications of these developments are that increasingly those in precarious jobs many of whom lack union representation are left with insufficient regulatory protection from employer non-compliance further heightening their insecurity taking the province of ontario as our focus in this article we critically examine alternative proposals for es enforcement placing our attention on those that enhance the involvement of unions in addressing es violations through this analysis we suggest that augmenting unions supportive roles in es enforcement holds the potential to enhance unions regulatory function and offers a possible means to support the ongoing efforts of other workers organizations to improve employer compliance with es mirchandani

multi-disciplinary team of researchers located in universities and community settings in toronto ontario the group designed and conducted a research project on the enforcement of labor standards in ontario canada discussion of methodological possibilities often began with nots that is consensus on methodological approaches the team collectively rejected out of these discussions emerged suggestions and approaches through which we navigated dilemmas in research design three such knots are presented in this paper specifically a epistemological tensions around mixed methods and the politics of mixing b the attempt to capture the relationships between research and its impact and c the need to develop interviews which both establish respondents as knowers and simultaneously focus on that which is unsaid/ normalized tucker eric alan hall leah f.vosko rebecca hall elliot siemiatycki 2015 canadian journal of law society 31 1 65-86 the purpose of this paper is to advance an approach to analyzing decision-making by front line public officials the notion of discretion in front line decision-making has been examined widely in the law and society literature however it has often failed to capture the different kinds and levels of decisions that enforcement officials make taking an interdisciplinary approach that draws on political sociological and legal analysis we propose a new conceptual framework one that draws a sharper distinction between discretion and judgment and teases out distinct levels in the scope and depth of decision-making we then use this framework to create a conceptual map of the decision-making process of front line officials charged with enforcing the employment standards act esa of ontario demonstrating that a deeper more precise analysis of discretion and judgment can contribute to a richer understanding of front line decision-making and its social political and legal implications noack andrea leah f. vosko and john grundy 2015 industrial relations/ relations industrielles equal first authorship with noack 70 1 86-109 this article reports on efforts to develop a telephone survey that measures the overall prevalence of employment standards es violations as well as their evasion and erosion in low-wage jobs in ontario without requiring that respondents have any pre-existing legal knowledge the result is a survey instrument that is unique in the canadian context and reflects the concerns of both academic researchers and workers rights activists pilot survey results show that ontario workers do not necessarily distinguish between es violations and other workplace grievances and complaints with careful questionnaire design it is nevertheless possible to measure the prevalence of es violations evasion and erosion in order to track the effects of es policies and their implementation it will be crucial to establish baseline measures and standardized reporting tools leah f. vosko valerie preston and robert latham eds. mcgill-queen s university press liberating temporariness explores the complex ways in which temporariness is being institutionalized as a condition of life for a growing number of

expanding temporariness in recognition of why pathways to permanence remain so compelling vosko leah f. 2013 osgoode hall law journal 50.4 845-873 workers in ontario canada are on the edge of a crisis in the enforcement of their minimum employment standards es this crisis is shaped not only by well-documented deficiencies in the scope of labour protection but by the fact that the administration of the es system has not kept pace with the increasing number of workers and workplaces requiring protection under the province s employment standards act coupled with an outmoded complaint-based system the dearth of support for es enforcement is cultivating a situation in which an unprecedented number of workers are bearers of rights without genuine opportunities for redress responding to this situation this article explores how measures augmenting the voices of workers and their advocates could contribute to improving es enforcement in ontario it does so through a review of innovative practices in other common law contexts characterized by similar enforcement regimes where labour market conditions have likewise deteriorated casey rebecca canadian centre for policy alternatives nova
