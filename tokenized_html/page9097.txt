nancy a brand new fruit juice maker who is working her way up to become in the big leagues in the fruit juice world this is a tm game with an actual storyline unlike contemporaries like diner dash and chocolate shop frenzy sound easy just making juice it is at first but you have quite a deep and fun filled challenge ahead of you fruit juice tycoon is a time management and a business tycoon game at the same time you start out as nancy a wealthy young woman talking to your brother who is part of a big company nancy decides to strike out on your own to test the waters instead of being reliant on her fatherâ€™s trust fund and run a business nancyâ€™s brother teases her and wants to see if she can run a juice making shop and she goes on ahead eager to prove she really is up for the challenge nancy is trained by peter the juice shopâ€™s manager in the tutorial that everyone should play otherwise you ll surely be lost in fjt with peterâ€™s help you learn the ropes which is how to sort fruit pour the drinks to the right level how to drink a cup that you screwed up on so there is no waste and finally how to buy the right amount of supplies there are 3 levels of difficulty slow medium and fast slow is obviously the easy level sorting fruit is easy you have to get 3 of the same kind of fruit in order for you to have one cup you just tap one container to select the fruit and tap another of the two other containers to move it around you have to pay attention to the level selector on the drink while you have a customer if you fill it just up to the level indicator you will have a perfect drink and the customer say cool thus giving you a cool point a couple of these and you get a bonus if you fill their drink below the line you will get a good compliment from the customer that s still good but the aim is to get cool points which are important to get 120 points in one week so you can get more money to upgrade further build your empire when you are at the store don t buy too much this will lead to waste or overbuying buy just enough when you get enough money you will be able to preserve equipment to preserve the fruit so it doesn t waste fruit only lasts one day before it spoils nancyâ€™s road to actually having a successful juice making empire is not going to be easy she has to deal with some nasty folks from a big time competitor who arenâ€™t about to let her take the lead over them in the juice making world fruit juice tycoon takes strategy for sure if you donâ€™t make enough money you wonâ€™t get a passing grade from the customers and wonâ€™t be able to afford a store anymore the touch controls in fruit juice tycoon were responsive easy for me to delve into and learn right off the bat sorting the fruit is the most important skill in the game if you canâ€™t make your juice you wonâ€™t even get off the ground floor but donâ€™t worry you will learn it very quickly keeping an eye on your supply was just a matter of being attentive and wasnâ€™t hard at all in my experience shopping for your store was very simple but you have to keep an eye on the supplies you need and how many you need as well keeping the customers isnâ€™t always easy when you think you are making the right type of juice drink for a customer but then they turn out to think the drink is poor or bad you definitely do not want too many poor or bad comments from the customers this will take away from your income and give you a failing grade at the end of each round the controls of the fruit juice tycoon mini-game which touch controlled based are delivering the right types of juice to their destination i found also simple all you do is hit the right color button corresponding to each truck and make sure they reach the right place in time if they donâ€™t then an unhappy face will be on the place and you donâ€™t want that it was a bit tricky at times because multiple trucks will come right another and you have to make sure each truck is going to the right place it is a fun challenge though what i love about fruit juice tycoon is that the interface is nice and clean it has wonderful and colorful graphics i wish they were a bit crisper but they look pretty good it would have been a great touch if you could actually hear the customers say their comments game play is overall smooth as a babyâ€™s behind a nice touch also is that in the game options menu you can choose to hear only the sound effects background music or no music at all what i found only slightly annoying in fjt was that you have to be mindful that you have two taps to finish each drink the first to stop the drink pouring and the second to serve it to the customer sometimes tapping wasnâ€™t always as responsive but it really wasnâ€™t that big of a deal at all this literally is a time management game with a twist indeed while it looks similar to other tm games like sallyâ€™s salon or even airport mania it is actually quite a deeper and strategy tycoon game as well the storyline i thought was very good and interesting which added to the overall enjoyment of the game i think this will definitely appeal to gamers who want a more meaty time management game this is without a doubt one of the best time management games in the app store itâ€™s not too hard and not to easy it is just right you work your way up and that gives you incentive what more do you want from a tm game
