an interview with virgin america s david cush airways magazine miami — david cush president and ceo of virgin america sat down with airways after his triumphant entrance to dallas love field with virgin group founder sir richard branson on the uber downtown express flight from dallas-fort worth international airport he spoke about what the move to love field will mean to his airline and the citizens of dallas as well as about other developments virgin america ceo david cush credits austin speaker airways obviously this is a big move for virgin it s your biggest expansion so far or at least in the last five years how important was this move for you from dfw to love field david cush well it was very important for us that we would not have launched flights to the east coast from dfw very simply american is too strong at dfw to go up against them we were confident with la and san francisco because we ve got big bases there so this is important because we think number one it will also strengthen our san francisco and la flights which is why we re increasing but also because it makes it possible for us to launch service into new york and reagan national airways are you also still looking into flights to chicago pending regulatory approval cush well we don t really need regulatory approval for chicago—we need gates which we don t have right now we re going to sit tight on that for a while we think with these two gates that we can get about 18 departures a day out of love field as of april we ll have four flights to each of our destinations so that s 16 so we re just going to be careful about how we use those last two it certainly could be chicago it s at the top of our list for new cities but we may also just decide to add additional frequencies to existing cities airways are there any other cities you re looking at for future service that may be of interest cush probably chicago is the biggest one i ll say as far as out of love field it s a massive market and again we re just being very careful about where we use our final two frequencies airways are you looking to grow in dallas in the future or are you comfortable with the 16-18 departures a day cush we will not split operations so we re not going to reopen dfw that s just too expensive and we ve got two gates and our expectation is that we will have to figure out how to operate out of those two gates so my guess is you re not going to see a lot of expansion as far as out of dallas unless gates magically become open which i doubt they will airways since the other carriers involved in the repeal of the wright amendment southwest and american are legally bound not to further appeal what remains of the wright amendment would virgin see down the road possibly trying to carry on that torch to expand the airport cush no not really i was here when that battle was fought it was a compromise with the community these are compromises we have every day when you have airports or any other facility surrounded by neighborhoods and i think it would be out of place for us to be the ones to challenge it this is southwest and american s home we re visitors airways could you see possibly trying to acquire one of the other gates here cush now that s a little bit contentious right now and i m going to stay out of it they have their own issues they re dealing with and we re happy with our two gates we re going to come in and just do a good job airways so far are ticket sales reflecting that the additions of new york and d.c. were good decisions for you cush yes—look it s very early washington just started today new york starts in a couple of weeks it s very early but what we ve seen with la and san francisco where we have comparisons because we flew from dfw last year looks very good we re confident with things going forward airways does it look like you re going to be able to support the extra frequencies pretty easily cush absolutely airways obviously virgin is sort of a niche market its routes are few compared to a lot of the other carriers have you looked into possibly codesharing with another carrier u.s.-based carrier cush we haven t looked at it seriously my strong gut feeling is that if we asked anyone they would say no their network strength is really the most overwhelming benefit they have and they wouldn t want us to be able to piggyback off that so it s not really in the plans for us airways and are there any other international carriers that you re looking at cush well we do a lot of international stuff interline as well as codeshare i believe we re just announcing a new codeshare tomorrow with china airlines so we do a lot in particular out of la and san francisco with asian carriers that are looking for some feed airways have you looked at some of the other carriers like porter or someone more on the east coast that would connect with your network cush we were close to the guys at porter don carty is our chairman and their chairman we ve looked at partnering with them in the past when we were in toronto but that simply didn t work they ve got some automation challenges that would make that difficult in terms of partnering so they aren t high on our list but they certainly run a fine airline airways this is the first time that any destination outside the west coast has gotten eastbound traffic could we see other destinations like chicago or austin with eastbound traffic cush it s hard to tell i think we try not to get ahead of ourselves we re going to try and learn a lot from our experience here at love field and then take it from there our expectation is we will open up more focus cities for lack of a better term in the u.s. it s just that we want to learn from this one first airways are any of those foreseen as being more on the east coast side you run a lot of short-haul flights up and down the west coast but that doesn t really exist on the east coast for you is that something you re looking at cush not a lot we ve got a pretty big operation in new york—we serve all three airports we are doing a little north-south flying out of new york this winter just seasonally it s not really big in our plans those are well-served markets with very strong competitors i think we re pretty comfortable where we are airways are there any other cities either in the network now or perhaps more interestingly that aren t in the network now that you d like to target for a next focus city cush we don t want to get ahead of ourselves we re going to develop love field we re going to i believe learn a lot from our experience here and that s really going to influence where we go next airways how has the withdraw from philadelphia gone over so far cush it was fine you know the mayor and the city were disappointed but they were very gracious they didn t take any shots at us as we were leaving we love philadelphia—i wish we could have made it work and we ll be back there someday but they were all very good to us all the way to the end no products in the cart would you feel safe flying on a boeing 737 max once the grounding is lifted view results would you feel safe flying on
