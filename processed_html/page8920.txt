Hiring New cinema5D Writers - Do You Have What it Takes? | cinema5D by  Nino Leitner  | 3rd May 2018 cinema5D has managed to become one of the most successful video camera gear reviews  &  news websites in the world over the past five years, and we are only getting started. We need more cinema5D writers. Our main focus on original, self-generated content   generated by the entire team which consists only of professional shooters who are working in the industry day in and day out. Unbiased and with different styles, the audience sees different takes and perspectives on new gear and shooting techniques. People appreciate personal opinions from professionals, even if they are different   which makes our content even more relevant. If you are only interested in writing guest posts or irregular posts, please DO NOT get in touch at this point in time as we need to focus on finding a regular writer first   irregular posts are however unpaid, but you will have your name and link to your website on them. We hope you see the opportunities and chances of growth this presents if you feel like we’re looking FOR YOU. Get in touch via hiring[at]cinema5D.com. And don’t hesitate to ask any questions too!
