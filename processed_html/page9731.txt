LTTng 2.0 and making use of trace tools and techniques to develop complex multicore embedded systems Â« Embedded Blog On my quest to continue to learn more about embedded systems development I was able to attend  LinuxCon 2012  One of the sessions I attended was an  update by Mathieu Desnoyers  (author and maintainer) on LTTng 2.0 The  Sourcery Analyzer  trace and analysis tool from Mentor Embedded makes use of LTTng and I m in meetings where we discuss the benefits of LTTng 2.0 so I was happy to have gotten an overview at Linuxcon. I ll write more on specific areas related to debugging, trace, LTTng 2.0, gdb (I m finding there are so many pieces to the puzzle) in the future. Core activity visualized along with the name of the program and assoicated process ID The first thing I was curious about was just  why tracing is useful to begin with . The LTTng 2.0 session was step one. The engineering manager for Sourcery Analyzer (our trace and analysis tool) has been busy writing a paper on the subject. Instead of taking out excerpts I thought the best thing to get the info is for people to  just be able to read it themselves .
