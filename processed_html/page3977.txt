Easy Rainbow Party Drinks | Mom Spark - Mom Blogger There are lots of holidays I don t see fit to spend tons of money on. Is St. Patrick s Day a lot of fun? Can be. Am I going to spend hundreds of dollars on a shamrock covered St. Patty s tree? Um, no. So when I craft for this particular holiday I try to keep things cheap. Or, even better I try to use things that I already have on hand. And I try to make things that don t need to be stored. Guaranteed if I start making all sorts of St. Patty s decorations, I won t find them this time next year. They ll be in the bottom of a box long forgotten. So I thought it would be fun for today s post to do something party related. Now this is great for now because it s rainbow themed. But it is also a lot of fun for a kid s party or play date to add something neat and jazzy to the day. I don t know about you, but it is the out of the normÂ things I remember most about being a child. So let s make some memories! For this project you will need: Just mix your water and food coloring until the color is nice and dark. Add to your ice cube tray and freeze. After frozen pop  em out and get ready for some fun! When one color is placed in the same glass you get a fun, bright color. You can even do two colors to make other colors. You know, yellow and red make orange and whatnot. BUT I wouldn t recommend just tossing every color in at once. I don t know if you ve ever mixed up a whole bunch of colors but the end result is ultimately brown. And this isn t a tasty soda looking brown. It s just nasty. Kids can choose their own colors and try a different one later. I ve found that if something has a color kids will notice a flavor that isn t even there. Yellow water will suddenly taste like bananas! And red like cherries! So with a little bit of effort, the kids can be super stoked and you can be the king or queen of the best party beverages ever.
