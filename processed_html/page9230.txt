This petition had 11 supporters Sydney's pretty great, but it's pretty shit.  It's impossible to buy a home, driving in the city is a nightmare, the way the city is laid out is stupid, lockout laws are terrible and in 30 years Sydney nightlife will probably be a thing of the past. I went to a restaurant in bondi once that wouldn't even do a take away hot dog.  Why there are so many Ibis' I'll never know but they shit me too.  The monorail was really cool, I mean who doesn't want to ride on a train that's up high?! It's amazing! Still burning that they scrapped it even though I only went on it once about a decade ago, but I would have used it more if it still existed and I'm sure there are countless other Sydneysiders in that exact position.  While I'm on trains I still don't understand why they didn't put a northwest rail line in when they built the area. That only makes sense doesn't it? Have a good think about this city of ours and tell me you honestly don't think that it should be called Shitney.  This petition had 11 supporters jayden saxon needs your help with “ Malcolm Turnbull: Change Sydney &# x27;s name to Shitney ”.
