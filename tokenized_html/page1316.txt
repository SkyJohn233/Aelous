will get a visit from the police while testing it 's limits the pws1200 is for people that would rather drive a viper than a porsche both are fast but in a different way let 's just say i had a little

you need but so is the viper very loud and clear and very impressive looking bulky but the sound makes up for its appearence just recieved this sub today and all i can say is wow this thing is huge and very loud i could not be happier with the sound that i am getting from this sub polk doesnt just use any sub on this they use two of the db series subs of their car audio line and those alone are worth 500 retail i recommend everyone to buy this sub if they can afford the hefty price tag of it similar products used velodyne ct120 very loud and clear and very impressive looking bulky but the

friends to help you move i bought this beast while i was working for circuit city in 1999 so i was able to get it at accomodation price all the reviewers below except for george from new york only a wimp lets a salesman push them into buying something they ca n't understand can attest to the fact that this thing is a piece of furniture you have to plan your room around it the advantage is that placing it on either end of a sofa allows it to serve as an end table as well as an earthshattering noise violation polk built this monster so well that even at heart-stopping levels you can balance your house of cards on it needless to say when i popped the covers off the speakers i was floored by the fact they had used 8ohm versions of the mammoth 12 db car subs i say mammoth because unlike most sub manufacturers polk created 12 subs that sound as good as 15 s without the size or power requirements and with this home theater sub you get _2_ do n't have a mono rca sub out jack on your amp no problem you can route your front speakers straight through this bad boy have 2 rca sub outs no problem plug them both in i have had this thing for several years and my comfortable listening level is 4 on the dial on the front at 5 the neighbors complain it goes to 11 folks and if you use your that stupid bass boost button on your amp with this goliath you should be shot my current system has some older speakers in it but if you check the reviews of the rt 7s and the cs 350 you 'll see this is as good if not better than the current i stuff being put out by polk right now front polk rt 7s

man group dvd-audio my ar-115s seems to work very hard to keep up with this dvd my living room is fairly large so i decide to look for a high performing sub i bought this one via mail order through

problem for the blue man dvd-audio if you want to test your system to the limit use this dvd-audio as a reference disc i also try the deep puple dvd-audio track 5 smoke on the water the bass

fantastic i was able to order it directly from polk and it was worth every cent that i spent i did n't realize it until i set it up but this sub is huge it has sounded great on everything i have listened to including jazz rock r rap classical and dvd movies most subs have the basic connections line in and out high level in and out and some phase crossover and gain controls but this sub has line level inputs for every channel when i write this i mean every channel front left front right center left surround right surround and lfe there is also a built in high pass crossover which can be switched between 40hz and 80hz for the line level front left and right outputs as for high level ins and outs there are only connections for the front left and right speakers the high-pass crossover for these can be set at 40hz or 80hz or can be shut off another nice thing about this sub is that it will automatically increase the volume by 3db for movies this circuit is turned on any time there is a signal present in the center channel the volume control for the sub is hidden on the front panel right below the polk audio logo this makes it convenient enough to adjust when needed and also not so convenient that you could accidentally turn it up too loud by bumping it the 12 drivers are very sturdy and tough and are mounted on 1 1/2 thick mdf to be sure that there are no cabinet resonances to color the sound this adds to the weight of the sub whick tips the scale at about 110 pounds needless to say once you get this in place you wo n't want to be moving it around much with all this sub has to offer i have to give it the best rating possible polk did a really good job with this one this sub just came out in may '99 and it is fantastic i was able to order it directly from polk and it
