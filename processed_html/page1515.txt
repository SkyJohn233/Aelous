Original Trailer Park Boys Movie from 1999. Black and White. Before the TV Show. : trailerparkboys Hello, Here  is a link to the Original Trailer Park Boys movie. This was directed by Mike Clattenburg and shown at the Atlantic  Film Festival in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1999. Barrie Dunn (Who plays  Ray) saw the potential for a TV show and approached Mike Clattenburg to  create a television series. And the rest is history. Link Thx m8, heres some pepperoni! Fuck that’s good pepperoni. Is this ok? Actually I don &# x27;t give a fuck! Thanks! The way I see is it’s a rare piece of fandom. It’s not the best quality. If it was DVD quality and I was selling it. I could see the problem. This is from one fan to another. Doesn &# x27;t work for me, is it down already? it still works No Bubbles in this one. Mike Smith was there and appeared briefly as one of the documentary crew following Ricky and Julian but not as Bubs. he gets shot right at the end. Mirror? This is great. The show is like 80-90% there. It &# x27;s interesting to see which background info they kept as canon and which they changed, or changed slightly. What &# x27;s the song playing from 29:26 30:18? I tried searching for the lyrics I heard but nothing. Here &# x27;s what I heard (I probably misheard some things) Wow thanks for sharing! Deeeeecent. Does not work for me 160k Members 213 Online Oct 29, 2009 Cake Day
