2019 this is in no way a judgement of the artist this is about the quality of the print which i am very displeased with the colors are muddy and the darker tones are way too black and run together not providing separation of the gold and brown tones the face of the horse from the eyes to the snout looks like shades of black with almost no shades of brown i bought the match to this print a few years back so aside from how the image on the website i know what this print should look like unless fineartamerica can provide me with a reprint i am going to request my money back buck oherin december 13th 2019 i was not happy with the quality of the print and missed the deadline to return it doubt i would buy again from fine art sue hallett december 13th 2019 fall foliage and timber perfect combo allyson bianchi december 13th 2019 my favorite fripp island photo ever i know exactly where this is on the island and it makes me smile every time i look at it mary phillips december 12th 2019 photo
