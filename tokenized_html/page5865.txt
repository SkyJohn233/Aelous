a game of men x2019 s league hockey when he absorbed an accidental hit to the head he was shaken by the blow and it wasn x2019 t long before it occurred to him he x2019 d probably suffered a concussion as much as he was enjoying the game he knew what he should probably do x2014 stop playing immediately and reassess his condition in the quiet of the dressing room in an age of heightened awareness around head injuries such common-sense tenets of self-preservation aren x2019 t exactly brain surgery but jha happens to be a brain surgeon so perhaps it was a surprise that for a long moment in the midst of that otherwise forgettable game of shinny he tried to convince himself he could play on before he took himself out x201c i x2019 m embarrassed to tell you this x201d he was saying recently x201c but i didn x2019 t want to come off the ice and i x2019 m playing for a beer imagine what these guys are thinking when they x2019 re playing for the stanley cup x201d if jha can relate to the possibly self-destructive instincts of uber-competitive athletes call it an occupational asset in a field that sees him cross paths with elite competitors and weekend warriors on a daily basis but don x2019 t misunderstand as a man of medicine he isn x2019 t prone to minimizing the damage being done by what he calls an ongoing x201c epidemic x201d of concussions the extent of which he understands better than most on many days he can be found at the private weston road clinic konkussion where he tends to about 200 concussion cases a week he x2019 s also founder and editor-in-chief of first medical journal devoted exclusively to the current research on concussions and later this month he will play host to an international conference that will bring to the gta many of the world x2019 s foremost experts in the field related brain damage detection rests on blood testing progress leading concussion experts coming to toronto area to brainstorm official koncussion retreat web page 10 athletes whose careers were devastated by concussions but even though jha 37 is devoting much of his life to concussions he says it x2019 s important to remember that most concussions when treated intelligently don x2019 t turn out to be a matter of life and death x201c the thing is you have certain groups going out there and creating hysteria around brain injuries x201d he said x201c it is an epidemic but at the end of the day 80 per cent of people get better in a short frame of time that gets overlooked very often x201d it gets overlooked because of the real and extreme cases of life-taking tragedy that have taken over the headlines and shaken the foundations of sports high-profile injuries billions in lawsuits suicides linked to repetitive head trauma x2014 the lot of it has led many to question whether pro sports especially collision sports like football and hockey will survive the gruesome emerging truths about their possible effects of the brains of the people who play them last year barack obama the u.s. president and an avid sports fan said if he had a son he wouldn x2019 t allow him to play football ditto lebron james the nba star who was a force on the high-school gridiron and nfl icons mike ditka adrian peterson and kurt warner but jha said he remains hopeful enough about the future of concussion care that he says he would allow his son akshay to one day participate in a collision sport should akshay now 4 xbd months old ever express such a passion x201c knowing everything i know i would say this absolutely i would allow it x201d he said x201c because the benefits of health fitness discipline character team building outweigh in my opinion the risks however education is of paramount importance x201d jha said he is optimistic in part because thanks to the millions being poured into concussion research by everyone from the nfl to the u.s. department of defence new discoveries for concussion diagnosis and treatment appear to be on the horizon he said he sees a day x2014 x201c we x2019 re a couple of years away x201d x2014 when there x2019 ll be a blood test or a hand-held scanning device to diagnose a concussion and there x2019 ve been recent studies on a handful of therapies that have shown promise still jha who has a gift for talking sports and science with an infectious enthusiasm says there x2019 s an ongoing need for improved education at the youth-sports level x201c it x2019 s the kids in our local neighbourhoods that don x2019 t have the access to care immediately to help them make the right decision we know if you get a second injury before fully recovering from a first one x2014 that is the real concern x201d jha said jha x2019 s konkussion clinic is a compelling model in state-of-the-art care for a fee of about 60 athletes get a baseline neurological test and a card with a telephone number they can call for around-the-clock advice should they suffer a concussion follow-up appointments are scheduled within 24 or 48 hours dr. charles tator the toronto neurosurgeon who has been a pioneer in treating and understanding head injuries lauded the approach in a recent interview x201c a few years ago it was almost impossible to get somebody knowledgeable to see a concussed patient in the first few weeks x201d said tator who has referred patients to jha and who is a member of the editorial board of jha x2019 s concussion journal x201c so dr. jha has really innovated this rapid access which is really a major asset i think he x2019 s the first one to be able to accomplish that x201d the gap in the system struck jha in 2010 when his mother prema suffered a concussion after falling down a set of stairs while shopping on queen street west at the time jha who grew up playing hockey in regina before moving to his ancestral india at age 12 to live for five years on an ashram was the chief resident in neurosurgery at mcmaster university he came away unimpressed with what he called the x201c confusing x201d way his mother x2019 s case was handled x201c it was a life-changing moment for me the moment the cat scan was normal the neurosurgeon said x2018 look there x2019 s nothing we can do the cat scan x2019 s normal x2019 x201d jha said x201c but we know almost all cat scans and mris are normal with a concussion i also knew my parents came from india my mother x2019 s a hard-working nurse loves the job she wanted to get back to work right away but she couldn x2019 t get back to work for four months because of cognitive issues headaches and memory issues x201c i couldn x2019 t understand why the emergency rooms didn x2019 t have any information why there were doctors x2014 general practitioners and emergency medicine doctors x2014 telling people that if the cat scan is normal and you didn x2019 t have a loss of consciousness it x2019 s not a concussion we know those things are not true x201d it wasn x2019 t long after that a life x2019 s mission was born and jha has since come to see a possible ally in the ongoing search for solutions the major sports leagues x2014 the same ones that have often been criticized for their handling of the concussion conundrum x201c the major sports leagues have a huge responsibility in my opinion to educate the children at the grassroots level who are not following the protocols correctly x201d jha said x201c kids don x2019 t want to listen to a boring doctor like me they want to listen to a sidney crosby they want to listen to a lebron james they want to listen to a clayton kershaw or a rickie fowler rather than attacking the professional sports leagues they could be our greatest partners in educating the grassroots level x201d later this month when jha welcomes many of the world x2019 s top authorities on concussions to his conference x2014 which will include dinner at the doctor x2019 s kleinberg home cooked by celebrity chef and friend susur lee x2014 he x2019 ll be among the undersigned of a white paper intended to set a new global standard for concussion management that the conference x2019 s list of attendees includes what jha calls a x201c hall of fame x201d of concussion specialists x2014 among them dr. robert cantu dr. julian bailes and tator x2014 will lend heft to the document and to a sales pitch jha plans to deliver to some of the world x2019 s top concussion researchers his angle that they work together x201c right now groups around the world are competing to do research we should not compete against each other we need to collaborate with each other but compete against the epidemic of concussion x201d he said there x2019 s money at stake companies racing to develop a silver-bullet solution that could reap multi-millions but jha insists he x2019 s not motivated by finances he says he doesn x2019 t draw a dollar x2019 s salary from konkussion that he makes a fine enough living in his day job as a brain and spine surgeon that his formative time living a monastic existence in india where he slept on the floor and owned two sets of clothes taught him the inconsequence of material possessions he said he still sleeps on the floor and drives a used red dodge challenger what truly drives him he said is coming up with good answers to the questions of the day in his field x201c will pro sports survive the concussion epidemic my opinion is yes they will x201d jha said x201c but we x2019 ve got to make adjustments i x2019 m not saying we haven x2019 t done things incorrectly in the past but what i am saying is we can change things and do things better together in the future x201d indeed it x2019 s a work in progress the blueprint to save sports that there x2019 s passionate optimism in its crafting is good news for everyone who desperately wants to keep playing
