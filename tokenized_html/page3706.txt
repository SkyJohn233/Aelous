the tour there or in usa itself does anyone have any information on how to sign up there is a link at the bottom of the page you reference thanks gaijinmike for your quick reply we have in fact opened that link using google translate regrettably we have no japanese but we see no information there on where to sign up perhaps we re missing something about making reservations we re also missing any indication that the bus tour circles back to ta ta.queueforload ta.queueforload function f g document.addeventlistener 'domcontentloaded f function ta.trackeventonpage 'postlinkinline 'impression 'postlinks-55872856 'log_autolink_impression usa station – it appears simply to go to oita airport beppu and oita if we could travel to and from usa on our jr railpasses we could save whole lotta money if i m reading right the listed phone no and fax no are for reservation and enquiry although seats are on a reserved basis if there are vacancies on the date of travel you can join on the spot they do pick-up at ta ta.queueforload ta.queueforload function f g document.addeventlistener 'domcontentloaded f function ta.trackeventonpage 'postlinkinline 'impression 'postlinks-55874677 'log_autolink_impression usa station but not drop-off their route is roughly following the letter shape p starting from oita in the south goes through beppu and then straight up to usa to pick up passengers the tour follows a crescent loop of the kunisaki peninsula and then returns south through beppu and oita if you want to take jr after the tour you can get off at beppu or oita station slightly cheaper if you get off at beppu thanks we ll try faxing a reservation request but ii suspect it ll be something to be solved by phone once we re there the route you describe is pretty much what we d made out from the link seems odd they wouldn t return to ta ta.queueforload ta.queueforload function f g document.addeventlistener 'domcontentloaded f function ta.trackeventonpage 'postlinkinline 'impression 'postlinks-55884723 'log_autolink_impression usa station though – surely they must get some people coming in from kokura to the north as we pointed out initially we ll be staying in beppu so if they ve dragged us all the way back there there s no need for jr but we could save money if we could start and end the tour in usa because we can get free rides to beppu using railpasses have you taken the tour yourself if so did you find it good i think this bus tour is a nice way to see some things in the area even though it focuses on a few temples and shrines they are quite a hassle to find on your own the ta ta.queueforload ta.queueforload function f g document.addeventlistener 'domcontentloaded f function ta.trackeventonpage 'postlinkinline 'impression 'postlinks-55889167 'log_autolink_impression futagoji temple was quite spectacular during fall the area north of beppu was one of my favorite places to hang out the oita area in general is very underrated including south of beppu because of the diverse variety of things to see in the area it took me three rental car trips to cover the best source of info is the jnto site click on each area www.jnto.go.jp/eng/location/regional/oita/ the nakatsu section doesn t mention a very scenic castle in nakatsu town which is next to the ocean making it one of the 3 major water castles in japan the tallest suspension bridge in japan is in kokonoe kitsuki is a nice cosy castle town ao-no-domon is a tunnel carved out of rock by a priest which took him 30 years by hammer and chisel the african safari park outside beppu is a blast rakanji temple was one of the most interesting temples i have seen in japan located on a bluff and with hundreds of rice paddles this link also shows a glimpse of nakatsu castle visit-oita.jp/sightseeing/…nakatsu.e.html ahhh that link reminded me of that place in japan where i was seaching the supermarkets for karaage chicken while beppu/oita city seems quite remote you can get there in about 2 hrs by express train or bus from fukuoka it wasn t until my 5th trip to beppu that i got around to the safari park last year i took a trip just to spend 3 days in oita city itself since it s often overshadowed by beppu/yufuin or bypassed by people heading to miyazaki dan for people who are somewhat comfortable driving in ta ta.queueforload ta.queueforload

'impression 'postlinks-55900877 'log_autolink_impression oita as it starts there picking up passengers in usa is more or else an additional enroute stop as it is doing an clockwise loop i don t quite follow your plan if you are staying in beppu you can join the tour there or are you staying the night before in usa and want to do the tour the next day before bedding down in beppu if so you can just take the tour from usa and though not 100 sure most long distance bus or tour bus will have luggage compartment between the wheels or else take an early train from usa to beppu leave your luggage at your beppu hotel and take the tour from beppu direct jr from usa to beppu can be as short as 30 min sorry can t be of much help about the bus tour as we hadn t gone on it for our last kyushu trip we used a rental car if language is a problem with the bus company try making enquiry through tourism oita prefecture at tourism we-love-oita.or.jp perfect english is used another good source is the beppu city tourist information whose email is tou-te city.beppu.oita.jp thanks for the links to english speaking tourist offcies we feel like proper goats having no japanese and these will be

'postlinkinline 'impression 'postlinks-55901114 'log_autolink_impression beppu as a base for several days making day trips to places such as usa it s true we could simply meet the bus in beppu and return there but we d hoped to get a little more time on the ground by getting to usa early and looking around before meeting the bus besides we re penny-pinchers and had hoped to save a buck by traveling to and from usa on railpasses and paying only for the kunisaki peninsula loop ta ta.queueforload ta.queueforload function f g document.addeventlistener 'domcontentloaded f function ta.trackeventonpage 'postlinkinline 'impression 'postlinks-55914268 'log_autolink_impression kyushu and hokkaido are easy places to drive because the continents are large so space isn t a constraint hokkaido is the only place where the little boat harbors along the coast are two lane since lots of land toocoo rental car is highly recommended because their prices are same as booking yourself but it includes the collision insurance in addition they have customer service in english budget rental car is usually the cheapest however they call the bank to check your credit card so it may take you 45 to get out the door
