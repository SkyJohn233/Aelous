Medi-Cal Waiver Program (MCWP) - Project Aries MCWP provides comprehensive case management and direct care services at no cost to persons with HIV disease or AIDS as an alternative to nursing facility care or hospitalization. Case management incorporates a collaborative interdisciplinary team approach consisting of a nurse case manager and a social work case manager who work with the client and his/her physician, family, caregiver(s), and other service providers to determine and provide needed services. Provider agencies are required to use ARIES to enter Medi-Cal Waiver Program data. This page will be updated as Medi-Cal Waiver- specific documents become available, so please check again at a later date.
