Simple Sewing - Upcycled Dress Lagenlook 102 | Create With CreoleSha Have you tried reading sewing patterns and just can't figure them out? (no sewing patterns needed) Do you want to refashion some clothes but have no clue where to start? Maybe you've been looking for something unique in your size and it's just not happening? I totally get it - I was in your shoes, i remember early in my creative life trying to read sewing patterns and walking away in frustration. When I first started upcycling I had no clue where to make the first cut much less what the finished look would be. I will walk you through step by step and the best part is no pattern is needed!! I will teach you how to create clothing you will love by starting with a shirt and adding to it to create a tunic or a dress that you will be proud to wear! So grab some clothes you want to upcycle and I will show you how to make something that you will love and wear! I will show you how to make a tunic similar to the two below :) You can see a Free Preview below under Class Curriculum!! * i will show you how to do a patchwork piece on the upper back * i will walk you through how to create a scrap fabric dragonfly! * upclose view of my freestyle stitching.  I just opened up an  Etsy shop  that will go along with my classes - there you can find all of my classes that I offer at the time and lots of fabric and notions that you might need to create with!
