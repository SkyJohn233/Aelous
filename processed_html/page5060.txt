Kexue Abstract                         In this study, we examined the various protein fractions and protein concentrates of two selected varieties (white and yellow) of foxtail millet grown in China. Characterized by amino acid analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The protein content for the white increased after defatting though not significantly different (p < 0.05) from 11.50 to 11.59 and the yellow decreased from 11.41 to 11.39. Fat content shows a significant decreased (p < 0.05) after defatting from 2.38 to 0.41(white) and 2.90 to 0.66 (yellow). Prolamin yellow and glutelin white were the major fractions (38.8 and 47.2%, respectively), followed by albumin yellow and white as 2.6 and 1.5%, respectively and globulin yellow and white as 2.5 and 1.4%, respectively and the difference was significant (p < 0.05) among the various protein fractions. Results showed a significant amount of amino acids with essential amino acids above the recommended amount by FAO/WHO for humans. Albumin white possessed the highest DSC result (Tp = 79.583 C,  H = 5.115 J g -1 ), glutelin white the lowest (Tp = 66.682 C,  H = 0.313 J g -1 ). Fractions and concentrates had molecular sizes below 14.0 and above 97. 0 kDa. Protein fractions and concentrates are potential as functional food ingredient.  INTRODUCTION Millet is a general term for a wide range of cereals. The name millet is used   to describe seeds from several taxonomically divergent species of grass. They   are grown mostly in marginal areas and under agricultural conditions in which   major cereals fail to give substantial yields ( FAO, 2008 ).   Millets are thought to have been among the first cultivated crops, being one   of the stable foods in central, Eastern Asia, Europe (mainly in China, India   and Russia) and some parts in Africa during the early ages ( Baltensperger,   1996 ). It is grown quite extensively in India though not of major importance   as a food crop. They form the major source of energy and protein for millions   of people of low income group in Asia and Africa. Millets are classified with   maize, sorghum and Coix (Job s tears) in the grass sub-family Panicoideae.   It is an important food in many  developing countries  because of its ability   to grow under adverse wheather conditions like limited rainfall. Foxtail millet ( Setaria italica  L.) is also known as Italian millet.   Foxtail millet is one of the world s oldest cultivated crops. Its cultivation   is estimated to have started over 4000 years ago ( Chang, 1987 ).   It is one of the most important food crops of the Neolithic culture in China.   In India, foxtail millet is grown primarily in the hot drought B prone arid   and semiarid zones and used mostly for food purposes especially by people with   low income. Foxtail millet is ranked as second in the world s total production   of millets and is an important staple food for millions of people in Europe   and Asia ( Marathee, 1993 ). Foxtail Millet is an important   cereal and nutritious food in traditional diets, especially for people on the   Europe, Asia and Africa continents. The main components of millet include starch,   protein, lipid, vitamins and minerals ( Usha  et al .,   1996 ). It was further reported that minerals like, magnesium, manganese and phosphorus   were significantly in higher amount than the others ( Gopalan    et al ., 1987 ). Millet in general contains significant quantity of   essential  amino acid s particularly the sulphur contain  amino acid s (methionine   and cysteine). It is also higher in fat content than maize, rice and sorghum    Obilana and Manyasa (2002) . It contains 12.3%  crude protein    and 3.3% minerals ( Vithal and Machewad, 2006 ). The seed protein from millet is responsible for up to 50% of the dry weight   of the entire seed and makes a significant contribution to their processing   properties and  nutritional quality  ( Shewry and Halford, 2002 ).   Although, millions of hectares of millet are harvested worldwide, providing   good source of protein for over 500 million people yet still little is known   about its important seed storage proteins ( Virk and Mangat,   1997 ). As millets differ from one another by their appearance, taste, grain   quality and morphological behavior, their bio chemical composition  will also   be different in a broad sense. For example, the major storage protein of Foxtail   millet is alcohol soluble prolamins (Monterio  et al ., 1988), whereas   in Kodo millet and Barnyard millet the alkali soluble glutelin forms the major   storage protein as reported by  Sudharshana  et al .   (1988)  and Monterio  et al . (1988). Although,  chemical composition  and  nutritive value s of foxtail millet have   been reported  Monteiro  et al . (1982)  little information   is available on the extraction, characterization and nutritional properties   of foxtail millet grown in China. These two varieties of foxtail millet (yellow   and white) are used in most traditional homes in Africa, Europe and Asia, but   no comprehensive study has been done simultaneously to show their similarities   and differences. Therefore, the main objective of this study were to extract,   characterize, study the nutritional differences between the two varieties of   foxtail and analyzed the  amino acid  composition, molecular weight distribution   of the subunits and their  thermal properties . MATERIALS AND METHODS The two varieties of foxtail millet (white and yellow) were purchased from a local market in Wuxi, People s Republic of China. All chemicals used in the experiments were of analytical grade. The foxtail millet (1 kg) was defatted twice with hexane for 8 h at room temperature the defatted Millet flour white (DFMFW) and the defatted Foxtail millet flour yellow (DFMFY) were air-dried for 24 h under a vacuum drier. The defatted flour was milled using a laboratory-scale hammer miller and the resulting flour was sieved through a 60 mesh screen and stored at 5 C in sealed glass jars until used. This research was conducted in the State Key Laboratory and School of Food Science and Technology Laboratory of Jiangnan University, Wuxi from December 2008 to April 2009. Proximate Analysis The  proximate composition  of Foxtail Millet Flour White (FMFW), Foxtail   Millet Flour Yellow (FMFY), Defatted Foxtail Millet Flour White (DFMFW) and   Defatted Foxtail Millet Flour Yellow (DFMFY) was determined according to Ceirwyn   (1995). The  moisture content  was determined by drying in an oven at 105 C   until a constant weight was obtained. Ash was determined by weighing the incinerated   residue obtained at 525 C after 4 h. Crude fat was extracted by the Soxhlet   method with petroleum ether. The  crude protein  was determined by the micro-Kjeldahl   method and a Conversion factor of 6.25 was used to quantify the  crude protein    content ( Tkachuk, 1969 ). The carbohydrate content was   estimated by subtracting the sum of percentage of moisture, crude fat, crude   protein and ash contents from 100%. Protein Fractionation Proteins were extracted from defatted fox tail millet flour based on their   solubility at room temperature (25 C) in water, 5% NaCl, 0.1 M NaOH and   70% ethanol using the procedure of  Osborne (1909)  with   minor modifications. The defatted flour was extracted with 400 mL distilled   water with stirring for 4 h and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 30 min to obtain   the albumin fraction (supernatant). The residue from this Step was then similarly   extracted with 400 mL of 5% NaCl to obtain the globulin fraction. The residue   after extraction of globulin was extracted with 0.1 M NaOH (1 h) to obtain the   glutelin fraction, while the residue after glutelin extraction was extracted   with 70% ethanol to obtain the prolamin fraction. All the extractions were carried   out twice. The albumin, globulin, glutelin and prolamin Fractions were then   purified by isoelectric precipitation at pH 4.0, 4.0, 4.1 and 2.5, respectively   and washed with distilled water. All fractions were freeze-dried using a Christ-Alpha   1-4 Freeze dryer (Biotech International, Germany). The determination of the   various protein fractions and concentrates (N H 6.25) was done with a Micro-Kjeldahl   method. Preparation of Protein Concentrate Defatted millet flour protein concentrate was prepared according to the   procedure described by  Olayide (2003)  with some modifications.   The defatted flour was dispersed in distilled water at flour to water ratio   of 1:5 (w/v); the pH was adjusted to pH 9.5 with 1 M NaOH and stirred for 3   h at 30 C. The extract was separated by centrifugation at 4000 x g for 30   min. The residues were re-extracted twice more as described above. The extracts   were then combined and protein was precipitated by adjusting the pH to 4.2 with   1 M HCl before centrifugation at 4000x g for 20 min. The protein concentrates   (precipitate) (pH 4.2) was washed twice with distilled water. It was then resuspended   in distilled water and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 1 M NaOH prior to freeze-drying.   The dry protein (protein concentrates) were stored in airtight glass containers   at 30 C for subsequent analyses. The protein content was determined by the   Kjeldahl method. Amino Acid Analysis For the determination of the  amino acid s, samples of protein fractions and   protein concentrates, 100 mg for all the samples with 5 mL 6 M HCl were added   in a 50 mL stopper bottle and sealed. The air was removed by keeping the sample   in a vacuum chamber. The sealed samples were placed in an oven at 120 C   for 16 h to hydrolyze. After hydrolysis, 5 mL of 2 mM norleucine internal standard   was added and the solution was filtered in a 0.2 FL Gelman membrane filter.   One milliliter of stock sample was pipetted into a 50 mL borosilicate glass   serum bottle and dried in a freeze-drier. One milliliter of sodium diluent buffer   (pH 2.2) was added to the freeze-dried residue and transferred to a 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge   tube for HPLC analysis. The prepared samples were injected as 2.5-FL volumes   and run on a Waters HPLC (Waters Corporation, Milford, Mass., USA) at a flow   rate of 0.4 mL min -1  with a Pickering sodium ion-exchange column   of 4 H 150 mm (Pickering Laboratories, Inc.) and sodium eluent (pH 3.15 and   7.40). TRIONE 7  ninhydrin reagent was added with post column instrument   (TRIONE 7  ninhydrin derivatization instrument, Pickering Laboratories,   Inc.). The light absorbance of  amino acid s was detected with an UV Visible detector   (Pickering Laboratories Inc., Mountain View, Calif., USA) at 570 nm wavelength   and the  amino acid s were quantified by comparing with standard  amino acid  profiles. Methionine and cysteine were determined separately by oxidation products according   to the per  formic acid  procedure of  Moore (1963)  before   hydrolysis in 6 M HCl. Tryptophan was determined after alkaline hydrolysis by   isocratic ion-exchange chromatography with o-phthalaldehyde derivatization followed   by fluorescence detection  Ravindran and Bryden (2005) .   Amino acid composition was reported as g/100 g of protein. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) Thermal properties of prolamin, Glutelin, albumin, globulin and protein   concentrate were evaluated using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) (Pyris-I-DSC,   Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, Conn. and USA). Seventy milligram of various samples   were dissolved in 1 mL of 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 M   NaCl. The protein solutions (45 FL) were transferred and hermetically sealed   in a stainless steel pan. The samples were heated by scanning from 25 to 135 C   at a rate of 10 C min -1  against a reference containing 45 FL   buffer without protein in a differential scanning calorimeter (Perkin-Elmer   Corp., Norwalk, Conn., USA). The denaturation peak temperature and enthalpy   were calculated by a thermal analysis data software program. SDS Page Analysis The  SDS-PAGE  was done on 12 separating and 4% stacking gels according to    Laemmli (1970)  using low molecular weight (14100-97400   Da) markers obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The lyophilized crude   extract powder (0.005 g) was dissolved in 1 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH   7.1. The solution was then centrifuged at 12000 Hg for 2 min to obtain the analytical   sample. The purified inhibitor was applied at a concentration of 0.15 mg mL -1 .   Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 was used for staining. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) using SAS statistical   software package (v. 8.1, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The Significant of difference   between means were determined by Duncan s Multiple Range Test (DMRT), where   (p < 0.05) was considered for significant difference. Each value was determined   by at least three replicates. Results were given as Mean SD. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Proximate Chemical Composition The proximate  chemical composition  of the various varieties (FMFW, FMFY,   DFMFW and DFMFY) was not significantly different (p < 0.05) to each other ( Table   1 ). After defatting the protein content for FMFW increased though not significantly   different (p < 0.05) (11.50 B 11.92). While, the protein content for the FMFY   after defatting decreased (11.41- 11.39), the removal of the fat from foxtail   millet did not significantly affect the protein content in foxtail millet. Nonetheless   our results corroborated the results reported for kodo millet ( Sudharshana    et al ., 1988 ). Before defatting, the fat content for FMFW and FMFY   was 2.38 and 2.90% respectively, but a significant decrease (p < 0.05) was   observed for DFMFW and DFMFY 0.41 and 0.66%, respectively. The fat content was   relatively low when compared to pearl millet (7.6%) and quinoa (6.3%) ( Oshodi   and Ogungbenle, 1999 ). It was also observed that the carbohydrates content   was significantly higher for all the samples ( Table 1 ). The   results from this study were within the range reported for other samples studied   ( Amado and Arrigoni, 1992 ). Other researchers found   that the carbohydrates were mainly composed of sugars (sucrose and raffinose),   fibers, pentosans and starch in wheat germs ( Amado and Arrigoni,   1992 ). Fractionation of Defatted Millet Protein   The results of the extracted protein fractions from defatted millet shows that   the protein content fractions (Albumin, Globulin, Glutelin and Prolamin) in   DFMFW and DFMFY revealed that prolamin is the major storage protein in the foxtail   millet ( Table 2 ). The content varied from 41 and 77.5% of   the total protein among the varieties, next to glutelins. Present resulted supported    Parvathy and Thayumanavan (1995) , who stated that prolamin   and glutelin are the predominant protein fractions in millet and sorghum. However,   in sorghum, pearl millet and finger millet prolamins and glutelins are present   in almost equal amounts and constitute two major storage protein fractions ( Tatham    et al ., 1996 ) and  Chandna and Matta (1990) .  A large amount of carbohydrates and pigments were extracted into the albumin   and globulin fractions this might be the reason for their low protein content.   The total protein fractions amounted to 75.6 and 59.9% (w/w) of the total protein   content for both white and yellow foxtail millet fractions. This result shows   a significant difference (p < 0.05). The alcohol soluble prolamin accounted   for 25.5 and 38.8% of the total proteins among the two varieties (white and   yellow), which was higher than that in wheat flour and rice ( Padhye   and Salunkhe, 1979 ;  Wrigley and Bietz, 1988 ). The   salt-soluble and alkali-soluble fractions for glutelin for both white and yellow   were 47.2 and 16.2%, respectively while globulin for white and yellow as 1.4   and 2.3%, respectively. The results are lower than those of  Wrigley   and Bietz (1988)  when they reported on the protein fractions and  amino acid s   in wheat flour. Albumin, globulin, prolamine and glutelin, when compared with   the reported values, the relative proportion of prolamin was higher, while globulin   was lower ( Wrigley and Bietz, 1988 ). These differences   may be due to millet cultivars, extracting procedures and meal preparation methods. Furthermore, the protein concentrates obtained had a Protein content of 56 and 63% for DFMFW and DFMFY, respectively. This result was significantly difference (p < 0.05). Prolamin and glutelin the predominant protein fractions in DFMFW and DFMFY, could also be the main protein fractions of the protein concentrate. Therefore, the preparation of protein concentrate would be an effective method for recovering proteins from defatted millet flour. Amino Acid Composition   The  amino acid  composition of the four fractions and their protein concentrates   of the two varieties of millet (DFMFW and DFMFY) were observed to have similar    amino acid  composition and no significant difference was found among the two   varieties ( Table 3 ). The  amino acid  patterns of the defatted   flours were in close agreement with the values reported for pearl millet and   sorghum ( Ejeta  et al ., 1987 ). Amino acid analysis   revealed that millet protein is rich in glutamic acid, leucine and alanine.   In addition, aspartic acid and lysine were high in the fractions of the two   varieties with the exception of prolamin which is deficient in lysine similar   to other cereal. Present results were in agreement with values reported by  Ejeta    et al . (1987)  and  Asiedu  et al . (1993)    but lower than values reported from Sudan by  El-Tinay  et   al . (1979) . Neucere and Sumrell (1980)  indicated that low content   of lysine in millet is attributed to the high content of prolamin (fraction)   in most varieties. DFMFW and DFMFY, their fractions and protein concentrates   have a well-balanced  amino acid  composition. Moreover, most of the essential    amino acid s in the protein fractions and protein concentrates were higher than   the reference pattern recommended by  FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) .   It was observed from  Table 3  that leucine and phenylalanine   + tyrosine are in excess amounts in millet protein. Lysine is the first limiting    amino acid  cereal as it was observed to be low in the present study. Cysteine   was lacking in millet protein. This fact indicates that S-S bonds would be absent   in millet protein. Compared with DFMFW and DFMFY, isoleucine, valine, tyrosine,   methionine, alanine, phenylalanine, leucine and histidine were extracted in   great proportion, while a loss of the content of tryptophan, cystine, threonine,   arginine and proline was observed in protein concentrates. The loss of tryptophan   is probably due to mild acid treatment in the preparation process of protein   concentrate, whereas the lower contents of threonine and arginine may have been   caused by alkaline processing, which can cause destruction of cystine, threonine,   arginine, serine and lysine ( Monique  et al ., 1975 ).   Therefore, effectively controlling the pH value is very important during protein   concentrate preparation. The  amino acid  composition of protein concentrate is   generally in accordance with earlier reported by  Ge  et   al . (2001)  except for the higher contents of methionine, leucine, alanine   and aspartic acid and the lower level of arginine, isoleucine, lysine and glutamic   acid in our concentrate. Among the four protein fractions, prolamin contained   the lowest amount of tryptophan and sulfur-containing  amino acid s. Also, prolamine   had the lowest amount of lysine. The prolamin and glutelin fractions had better-balanced    amino acid  patterns when compared with the globulin and albumin fractions. Therefore,   prolamin, the predominant fraction of DFMFW and DFMFY were the best for healthy   food formulation. Classifications of  amino acid s in different groups according to  chemical properties  are shown in  Table 4 . Among the four protein fractions and protein concentrates of the two varieties, globulins yellow and prolamin white fractions contained the highest amount of sulfur-containing  amino acid s, globulin yellow and albumin white have the highest amount of basic  amino acid s, whereas hydrophobic and aromatic  amino acid s content were the lowest, while the sulfur-containing  amino acid s in globulin fraction were the lowest. The prolamine fractions of both varieties contained the highest amount of acidic  amino acid s, whereas the content of uncharged polar  amino acid s was found to be very low in prolamin yellow and globulin white. The glutelin yellow and globulin white have the lowest amount of acidic  amino acid s. The globulin yellow and prolamin white have the highest total aromatic  amino acid s. There was no significant difference between four protein fractions of both varieties compared with their protein concentrate and the defatted flour. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) Differential scanning calorimetry  is a rapid, easy and capable technique   for supplying both thermodynamic (heat capacity, enthalpy and entropy) and kinetic   data (reaction rate and  activation energy ) on protein denaturation and has been   used extensively in various food systems. DSC has been used to study the thermal   properties and structural changes of proteins  Reaker and   Johnson (1995) . This method is highly sensitive to conformational changes ( Gorinstein  et al ., 1996 ). The information   on protein  thermal properties  is useful for food-processing strategies and heat-processing   design ( Ju  et al ., 2001 ) .  Data from DSC   measurements for prolamin, globulin, albumin, glutelin and the protein concentrate   for DFMFW and DFMFY are given  Table 5 . According to the results   the samples have varied denaturation temperatures 77.051, 72.100, 79.583, 66.682,   75.528, 79.398, 70.820, 79.206, 77.383 and 71.476 C, respectively. The samples   showed progressively lower enthalpies with increasing outlet temperatures. The   enthalpy did not differ significantly among the various fractions.  Wang    et al . (1999)  reported that the denaturation temperature and enthalpy   changes were 83.4 C and 0.96 J g -1  for rice bran protein concentrate.   The enthalpies of the various samples as stated above were 0.028, 2.288, 5.115,   0.313, 0.272, 0.022, 0.291, 0.047, 0.019 and 0.045 C, respectively. In this   study, the various fractions where less denatured than similar product reported   by  Wang  et al . (1999) . Except glutelin from foxtail   millet flour white that is higher than the reported value ( Wang    et al ., 1999 ). However, the denaturation temperature of the millet   globulin fraction was generally consistent with previous findings (84-96, 77   and 88 C) for oats globulin ( Harwalkar and Ma, 1987 ).   In addition, our results for the globulin fraction are close to the reported   values as compared with other cereal proteins ( Harwalkar   and Ma, 1987 ). The result shows that albumin of millet was more heat-sensitive   than rice (73.3 C) and oat (87 C) albumins, whereas the enthalpy of   millet globulin was lower than those (3.14 J g -1  and 5.39 cal g -1 )   of rice and oat globulins ( Ma and Harwalkar, 1984 ;  Ju    et al ., 2001 ).Thus, the structural properties of defatted foxtail   millet protein fractions and protein concentrates will be significantly affected   if during their preparation the temperature exceed 80 C, this will denature   the proteins. SDS Page Analysis SDS-PAGE  analysis of the fractions and their concentrates are shown in  Fig.   1a and b . There is a streaking in the patterns of the proteins of the fractions   and protein concentrates among the two varieties. Albumin and globulin fractions   revealed polypeptides of a wide range of molecular weights. A low protein variety,   the fractions were found to have a higher concentration of low-molecular weight   polypeptides. Several bands were seen at 97.4, 66.2, 43.0, 35.0 and 20.0 kDa   among the two varieties. This is contrary to kodo millet and barnyard millet which have only four components   of albumin and globulin in the range 14.0-32.0 kDa (Monteiro  et al .,   1988). The SDS -PAGE of prolamins  Fig. 1a and b , lane 5 and   6 showed a slight variation among the varieties. Four prominent bands were seen,   two below 31.0 kDa, 20 kDa, 14.0 kDa and one prominent band was also seen below   14.0 kDa lane 5 ( Fig. 1a ). This is similar to the report that   prolamins were distributed within the molecular weight range of 27-13 kDa and   four to five bands appeared within that range ( Parvathy   and Thayumanavan, 1995 ). Nonetheless, however, only two bands appeared within   that range in  Fig. 1b  lane 6. On the contrary, maize contains   10 different polypeptides in the prolamin fraction ( Chandna   and Matta, 1990 ). The  SDS-PAGE  of glutelins  Fig. 1a and b    revealed many bands throughout the length of the gel and showed no variation   among the selected foxtail millet varieties. The  SDS-PAGE  of the protein concentrates    Fig. 1a and b  also revealed that many bands run throughout   the length of the gel and showed no variation among the yellow and white foxtail   millet. CONCLUSION The defatted foxtail millet flour for both varieties contains a moderate amount of protein. Furthermore, the results of the protein characteristics show that millet protein fractions and protein concentrates have potential as a functional food ingredient. The essential  amino acid  pattern of foxtail millet proteins fractions and their concentrates suggests their possible use as a supplementary protein source to most cereals because this protein is rich in lysine, which is the 1st limiting  amino acid  for most cereals. They had varied denaturation temperatures and the fractions were found to have a higher concentration of low molecular weight polypeptides. The combined protein fractions and protein concentrates could be used as protein ingredients in food industries.
