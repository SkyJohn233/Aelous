Best Answer gtxjoe, 04 August 2018 - 07:03 PM Windows setting Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Display It should be set to 100% Neophyte Posted  04 August 2018 - 05:04 PM Hi All Newbie here making my first cabinet.  I'm struggling to change the screen size of my  B2S  Backglass Server settings window after loading a table in VPX.  Below is what it looks like for me currently when I right click on the backglass for any VPX table I load which makes it impossible to change any settings and the screen doesn't appear to let me resize it, just move it around. VP9  tables show the settings screen just fine.  I'm not sure what details you need to help, but I'm currently running a 2 monitor setup.  Playfield is on a 4k monitor connected via HDMI to my graphics card and the backglass is on a 1080p monitor connected via HDMI to the On Board graphics. Any help is appreciated.  Thanks! Pinball Fan Posted  04 August 2018 - 05:51 PM It seems you've increased the DPI. Neophyte Posted  04 August 2018 - 06:10 PM How do I go about getting that changed back?  I don't recall changing anything related to DPI.  I see there are some options related to DPI under Properties- > Compatability- > Change High DPI Settings when I right click on an EXE.  I tried changing some of those for VPinballX.exe and B2SBackglassServerEXE.exe to no avail.
