Thought I &# x27;d share my new Disc Golf bag that I made you guys! (Hand painted Discraft Weekender bag) : discgolf The album showing what the bag started out as, and what it looked like before the TARDIS patch was added. That looks wicked! How long did it take you to do? A couple of hours, once I got it in my head to do it. Part of that time was spent waiting for paint and weatherproofing to dry. That is awesome. I would strongly consider paying to have this done. The thought certainly had occurred to me to offer the service, but I &# x27;ve had enough experience doing commissioned artwork that it &# x27;s a bit more trouble than it &# x27;s worth at the moment. Step 1:  Have talent. So badass, how good is the print? You think it would last a season or two? It &# x27;s not a print, it &# x27;s hand painted with acrylic paints and sealed with Kiwi Camp Dry. I did a pair of converse sneakers the same way, and they &# x27;ve lasted about a year with no visible wear on the paint. And I &# x27;ve taken them through some mud and other rough conditions. So hopefully this &# x27;ll last pretty good too. Hope there &# x27;s room for a fez and bow tie in there. They &# x27;re cool. Is it bigger on the inside? It just might be... 88.7k Members 478 Online Jul 16, 2008 Cake Day
