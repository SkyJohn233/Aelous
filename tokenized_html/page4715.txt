national minimum standard in the 2008 naplan reading and numeracy assessments also taking account of aboriginal student populations and english as an additional language eal and english as an additional dialect ead students the program was developed around the three components of the school improvement cycle in implementing their selected strategies schools were able to access direct support from a program team comprising two consultant principals one literacy consultant one numeracy consultant and one consultant specializing in eal/d this team was available for support and guidance over the two years of the program they participated in the planning process guided schools through data analysis to inform improvement targets and provided regular and spaced professional learning pl opportunities to build the capacity of specialist teachers in-school mentoring and coaching was provided to schools by the team on an as-needs basis a key focus of the team was to ensure school leadership teams established processes to involve all staff in quality analysis of school data and ensure staff owners hip of performance information schools were provided with a planning pack which included a prescribed template that addressed school and performance data was analysed including this analysis allowed schools to set challenging yet realistic targets and plan focused interventions s chools select ed from a range of strategies to improve students literacy and numeracy standards with a particular focus on students who were at or below n ational m inimum s tandards or not achieving their potential these strategies were embedded in the school 's overall plan the strategies selected by schools had to have a clear evidence-base outlining their efficacy in improving students l iteracy and numeracy standards strategies in the planning pack focused on the first steps prog ram notably s chools were encouraged to use a case-management approach to identify individual student and small group learning needs and to differentiate instruction specialist teachers usually drawn from existing staff members were nominated to work alongside classroom teachers to improve literacy and numeracy practice training was provided by the program team to enable specialist teachers to work effectively in the context of particular schools and student populations the team also provided professional learning tailored to individual school requests over the two years of the program teachers in this role went on to share their expertise with colleagues and build the capacity of the whole school to improve k – 7 literacy and numeracy schools developed a performance management p lan pmp that contained goals performance indicators actions agreed support and time frames link ed to the targets and strategies contained in the program school plan a n online self- assessment tool called a m onitoring review framework mrf was completed quarterly by schools this was designed to help schools make informed judg e ments about the extent to which they had implemented the key strategies of the program and to encourage whole-school reflection the aim of this program was to achieve sustained improvement in literacy and numeracy learning outcomes for students and improve the mean scores and proportion of students at or above the national minimum standard in y ears 3 5 and 7 in naplan re ading and numeracy assessments the data from all 74 program schools was used to compare the reading and numeracy mean in each year level for 2009 and 2011 and the mean progress from year 3 to year 5 and from year 5 to year 7 the year 2009 was used as the baseline because it the following tables show that the program schools average was above the western australian average on every measure with approximately 70 per cent of lnnp schools closing the gap between their performance and the state performance in both reading and nume racy table 1 changes in the mean literacy score

from improvements in students literacy and numeracy outcomes schools highlighted the following benefits and outco mes resulting from the program participating schools identified embedding cultural change as critical to maintaining the momentum created by the program ensuring changes to teaching and collaborative practices beco me ingrained in school culture cultural change is seen as sustainable by schools because it is ultimately underpinned by school staff recognising the benefits of the school s approach and the enhanced sense of professional satisfaction teachers have gained from improving student achievement the program was developed around building the capacity of school communities rather than on strategie s that require ongoing funding factors in program schools that contribute d to the sustain ability of the program include resea rch consistently identifies approaches to teaching that le a d to improvement in students literacy and numeracy learning the key outcomes of this research include reflecting on the insights provided by these documents the program focused on assisting schools with the process of collaborative planning coordinating the provision of opportunities for professional learning for school leaders and specialist teachers and assisting schools in the setting of improvement targets first steps http
