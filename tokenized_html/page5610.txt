dr neil williams academic profiles kingston university london home academic staff dr neil williams i am the director of undergraduate studies for the faculty of science engineering and computing where my focus is on enhancing learning teaching and assessment practices within the faculty i have a long standing interest in evaluation and pedagogic research in the stem area my research interests lie in the areas of organometallic chemistry ligand synthesis n-heterocyclic carbenes catalysis and surface chemistry surface modification and characterisation silica supported tm catalysts modified pmma intraocular lenses and wind turbine blade coatings i obtained my phd on surface organometallic chemistry under the supervision of professor john evans from the university of southampton in 1992 i subsequently did post-doctoral research in the area of inorganic chemistry and surface chemistry at the national institute for materials and chemical research japan university of sussex and the university of east anglia in 2019 i am chairing the 4th horizons in stem higher education conference kingston university at kingston university 3-4th july 2019 look up https
