Winds SE at 5 to 10 mph.  Updated: December 7, 2019 @ 1:57 am Greenville, Texas Hunt County has a unique opportunity the next two and a half weeks. We could set a state record for highest voter turnout – and it wouldn’t really be difficult at all. According to new numbers from the Texas Secretary of State, Hunt County now has 55,193 registered voters. With approximately 67,500 citizens 18 or older, that means 82 percent of Hunt County adults are signed up to cast a ballot during early voting, which starts tomorrow, or on Election Day, Nov. 6. That’s a much higher rate of registration than the state, which now has 15.8 million registered voters (a new record high), meaning about 61 percent of the state’s eligible residents are registered. In the 2016 election, Hunt County saw a “record high” 61 percent of registered voters show up to cast ballots. We can do better than that – we must. There is much at stake in this election, even without a presidential race on the ballot. To name just a few of the biggest issues expected to be decided in the near future by the United States Congress, for which two seats will be on the ballot: • The future of Medicare and Social Security, now due to run out of money in 2026 and 2034, respectively; Republican leaders this week issued calls for even faster rollbacks to those programs, both of which are funded by your income taxes • The accessibility and affordability of health-care services and insurance, also facing big decisions as Congress considers eliminating protection for many more pre-existing conditions • An answer to the big immigration question and President Trump’s proposed border wall Locally, voters should consider the challenges they face on a daily basis, before choosing their candidates. Are your roads in decent shape? Are your property taxes high enough? Are you concerned about local infrastructure, your school district finances or funding levels? Well, it’s time to get off Facebook and put your ballot where your mouth is, people. If everyone who complains about any one of the above things in Hunt County goes to vote, we will surely set a record for highest voter turnout in the state, and possibly the country. Participation in our democratic republic is not simply a “right,” it is a “responsibility.” It is something we should all do, and we should help and encourage our friends, family and neighbors to do the same. Let’s do this! See y’all at the polls. • • • Early voting opens tomorrow at 8 a.m. and continues for two weeks, til Election Day, Nov. 6. Early votes can be cast in two locations: At the Hunt County Voter Administration office, 2217 Washington St., Greenville, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays Monday, Oct. 22 through Friday, Nov. 2, plus the following extended hours: Tuesday, Oct. 23, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.;  Saturday, Oct. 27, 8 a.m. to noon; Sunday, Oct. 28, 1 to 5 p.m.; and Thursday, Nov. 1, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. At Greenville High School, 3515 Lions Lair on Oct. 25 and Oct. 26, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Thank you!
