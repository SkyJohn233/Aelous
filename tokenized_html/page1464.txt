my hero reminds me of the tulips in holland â€“ my hero calls me mama on many nights like tonight i wonder what it would be like if my son did n't have underlying medical issues the kind that every so often leave me feeling like i 've been kicked in my gut my beautiful wonderful fierce child is the same child who leaves my heart sad on nights like this one my nineteen-month old son has an extensive medical history a story that 's an unfinished book in itself is home on life supportive medical equipment tonight my son required his trach tube to be emergently changed i knelt over my son began bagging him with oxygen and watched his vital signs and clinical changes praying he would fight through his respiratory distress shortly after my son stabilized i began my usual pacing and restocking necessary medical supplies that are kept in his bedroom you see if i do n't keep moving i end up exactly where i am at this moment when the scare and chaos quite frankly settle i start to melt right into this chair i 'm sitting in next to my sons crib he 's safe sound asleep i sit here and replay the event how could i have responded quicker the fear that was seeping through my pores while i cleaned up after the event is gone i 'm left with the emotions that follow the fear i tell myself it 's merely mother 's guilt and human nature to wonder how things could have gone differently there 's this sting that happens to me after events like tonight it 's a sting i believe comes from a place of goodness and gratitude the sting is cold in all of its rawness it washes over me reminding me just how lucky i am to have my son he is brave resilient and the fire that burns in him well i 'll take partial credit for that if i had to place tonight on a scale a real scale that shows abel 's life his truths his battles tonight was pretty light and brisk the weight this child has carried and i too have shared the load in my own way is far more than this evening could even compete with you see as a mother to a child with complex medical needs there is no rest when the mess was cleaned that i felt had taken over our evening my heart still reminded me i felt sad sad that my child is n't normal maybe sometimes the selfish part of me wants so badly for my child to have better health so that he could sit at the dinner table with me do that whole co sleeping thing or even go for a walk or a car ride without packing up more medical equipment than i can carry sad that i ca n't predict when he will be in respiratory distress do n't moms naturally have the super power instinct let me clarify the miracles always drown out my fears my son always shows me how important it is to embrace the moments with him i thank god for the ability he has given me to be able to see past the sadness and devastation in the moments i feel weak the mountains are n't behind abel or our family but i 'm aware of just how precious his life and smiles are the cloud that gives shadow to the goodness we are fortunate to have is brief nights like tonight can make me feel like holland is a place that bears too much weight on my shoulders if that holds no significance to you i recommend you check out emily kingsley 's poem welcome to holland especially if you 're the caregiver to a medically complex kid too just as i metaphorically explore holland asking myself just how i got here my son opens his eyes and grab my attention to go over to his crib for playtime tulips are quite lovely to finish off the night. but if you spend your life mourning the fact that you did n't get to italy you may never be free to enjoy the very special the very lovely things about holland emily kingsley welcome to holland -dee founder and proud owner of my hero calls me mama llc amazon american express apple pay diners club discover google pay jcb mastercard paypal shopify pay venmo visa
