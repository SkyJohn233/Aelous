Trinity - English (Poetry Live) On 23rd February 29 Year 11 students visited the Royal Centre,  Nottingham to take part in this year's Poetry Live. This event is hosted by the AQA exam board, chaired by Tony Childs the Chief Examiner, and features poets on the syllabus. The poets each had about twenty minutes to read their poems, give some context as to how they  were written, and then answer questions posed by the students. We saw the Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy, as well as Simon Armitage, John Agard, Imtiaz Dharkar, Gillian Clarke and Daljit Nagra. All of the poets revealed some interesting insights as to how the  poems were formed; all seemed to have the seed of everyday experience,  made different, made exceptional by their craft. We were entertained,  educated and challenged to think. Each poet had a particular signature: Duffy's warmth when talking of her work, Agard's exuberance at the joy of words tempered by a political edge, Dharkar's feeling for sound, and Armitage's dry, wry wit. It was an enjoyable day.
