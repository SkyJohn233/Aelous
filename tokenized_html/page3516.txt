cyclic amp camp and camp receptor protein influence both synthesis and uptake of extracellular autoinducer 2 in escherichia coli journal of bacteriology advanced search bacterial autoinducer 2 ai-2 is proposed to be an interspecies mediator of cell-cell communication that enables cells to operate at the multicellular level many environmental stimuli have been shown to affect the extracellular ai-2 levels carbon sources being among the most important in this report we show that both ai-2 synthesis and uptake in escherichia coli are subject to catabolite repression through the cyclic amp camp -crp complex which directly stimulates transcription of the lsr for luxs regulated operon and indirectly represses luxs expression specifically camp-crp is shown to bind to a crp binding site located in the upstream region of the lsr promoter and works with the lsrr repressor to regulate ai-2 uptake the functions of the lsr operon and its regulators lsrr and lsrk previously reported in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium are confirmed here for e. coli the elucidation of camp-crp involvement in e. coli autoinduction impacts many areas including the growth of e. coli in fermentation processes follow jbacteriology asmicrobiology asm journals are the most prominent publications in the field delivering up-to-date and authoritative coverage of both basic and clinical microbiology about asm contact us press room asm is a member of copyright 2019 american society for microbiology privacy policy website feedback print issn 0021-9193 online issn 1098-5530 thank you for sharing this journal of bacteriology article note we request your email address only to inform the recipient that it was you who recommended this article and that it is not junk mail we do not retain these email addresses we use cookies on this site to enhance your user experience by clicking any link on this page you are giving your consent for us to set cookies
