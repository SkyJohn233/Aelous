comparable quality assurance of human papillomavirus hpv dna detection and typing methods is essential for evaluation of hpv vaccines and effective monitoring and implementation of hpv vaccination programs therefore the world health organization who hpv laboratory network labnet designed an international proficiency study following announcement at the who website the responding laboratories performed hpv typing using one or more of their usual assays on 43 coded samples composed of titration series of purified plasmids of 16 hpv types hpv6 -11 -16 -18 -31 -33 -35 -39 -45 -51 -52 -56 -58 -59 -66 and -68 detection of at least 50 iu of hpv16 or hpv18 dna and of 500 genome equivalents ge of the other 14 hpv types in samples with single and multiple hpv types was considered proficient fifty-four laboratories worldwide submitted a total of 84 data sets more than 21 hpv-genotyping assays were used commonly used methods were linear array lineblot innolipa clinical array type-specific real-time pcr pcr-luminex and microarray assays the major oncogenic hpv types hpv16 and -18 were detected in 89.7 x00025 70/78 and 92.2 x00025 71/77 of the data sets respectively hpv types 56 59 and 68 were the least commonly detected types in less than 80 x00025 of the data sets twenty-eight data sets reported multiple false-positive results and were considered nonproficient in conclusion we found that international proficiency studies traceable to international standards allow standardized quality assurance for different hpv-typing assays and enable the comparison of data generated from different laboratories worldwide human papillomavirus hpv infection has been established as the major cause of cervical cancer 2 epidemiological studies have classified genital hpv types into high- and low-risk hpv types reflecting their association with invasive cancer 19 the most important high-risk types hpv16 and hpv18 account for about 70 x00025 of all invasive cervical cancers worldwide the next most common hpv types on all continents are hpv31 -33 -35 -45 -52 and -58 found in approximately 20 x00025 of cervical cancers 19 an accurate and internationally comparable hpv dna detection and typing methodology is an essential component in the evaluation of hpv vaccines and in effective implementation and monitoring of hpv vaccination programs the genotyping assays used today differ in their performance with regard to type-specific detection rates 10 as the methodology for quality assurance and evaluation of assay performance is not standardized comparisons between different studies that use different assays is particularly difficult 10 the world health organization who establishes international biological standard materials and reference reagents for substances of biological origin used in prophylaxis and in therapy or diagnosis of human diseases http //www.who.int/biologicals/reference_preparations/en/ at the who meeting held in geneva switzerland from 15 to 17 august 2005 an expert group recommended the establishment of a global hpv laboratory network hpv labnet to contribute to improving the quality of laboratory services for effective surveillance and hpv vaccination impact monitoring major activities within the hpv labnet include the development of international standard reagents and standard operating procedures sops and the development of internationally comparable quality assurance methods 5 26 international proficiency panels are already widely used for several microorganisms including hepatitis a b and c viruses herpes simplex virus hsv and human immunodeficiency virus hiv 15 18 24 as there is no natural source of biological material that could be used to generate type-specific hpv international standards iss the first who international collaborative study of the detection of hpv dna examined the feasibility of using recombinant hpv dna plasmids as standards focusing on hpv16 and hpv18 13 iss of hpv16 and hpv18 dna were

l1 through e7 including nucleotides 5012 to 956 and hpv35-l including nucleotides 956 to 5012 the plasmid used for hpv68 contained only the l1 gene the dna of each individual hpv genome was generated by overnight culture of transformed escherichia coli and plasmid purification using a qiagen midi-prep kit optical density determinations were made at 260 nm and 280 nm to estimate the purity of the

was added to the te buffer to mimic a molecular-matrix background that would typically be present in biological samples table x200b table1 1 summarizes the composition of the panel the different amounts of plasmid 5 to 500 ge or iu were chosen to reflect the lower spectrum of the amounts of virus that would typically be present in clinical samples for example a study of virus quantities present in cervical samples from healthy hpv-positive women found an average of 18,000 ge of hpv16/100 ng input dna range x0003c 300 to 14,000,000 ge/100 ng input dna 20 the 43 different panel samples were prepared by dilution of hpv recombinant dna plasmid stock solution in te buffer in the background of human placental dna briefly the hpv dna plasmids were diluted 100-fold in te-placenta buffer to 10 4 ge/ x003bc l and further 10-fold dilutions were made to a final concentration of 1 iu/ x003bc l of hpv16 and hpv18 for the other hpv types included 10 ge/ x003bc l was the final dilution to ensure the high quality of the panel two hpv types were diluted each day with an interval of at least 4 h in between the samples containing multiple types were prepared from dilutions of 10 3 genome

2008 and randomly assigned numbers from 1 through 43 the panels were stored at x0002b 4 x000b0 c before shipment to participating laboratories the participants were instructed to perform hpv typing according to their standard methods using their standard sample input volumes two different cell lines were used as controls for the extraction process in participating laboratories the hpv-negative epithelial cell line c33a derived from human cervical carcinoma and the hpv16-positive epithelial cell line siha derived from a squamous cell carcinoma were purchased from the american type culture

participants in the study were recruited by advertisement at the who website the panels were distributed from the who hpv labnet grl in sweden at ambient temperature to 61 laboratories worldwide by who region america region 16 laboratories africa region 1 laboratory eastern mediterranean region 1 laboratory european region 28 laboratories southeast asia region 2 laboratories and western pacific region 13 laboratories the package also included a letter of instruction as well as a form for reporting the results of the testing of the panel and technical information on the procedures to be performed the laboratories were asked to submit the results of the tests performed to the who grl in sweden within 4 weeks of receipt of the specimens the agreement included assigning the right to publish the data to the who but it was agreed that only coded results from all laboratories would be presented grouped by the methods performed all results submitted to the who hpv labnet grl sweden were coded and analyzed anonymously the data sets generated were designated numerically from 1 through 84 individual results of the proficiency study were disclosed only to the participating laboratory that generated the data the different hpv-typing methods that were used to generate results for the who labnet proficiency study to detect hpv dna 1 3 6 9 17 21 22 25 are summarized in table x200b table2 2 criteria used for considering a data set to be proficient were as follows i detection of at least 50 iu per 5 x003bc l of hpv16 and hpv18 in both single and multiple hpv infections ii detection of at least 500 ge per 5 x003bc l of the other hpv types included in both single and multiple infections and iii at most one false-positive result these criteria were arrived at by a consensus opinion of international experts participating in an international who workshop in geneva switzerland in 2008 5 and were based on a consideration of which performance requirements were required and realistic a higher requirement for hpv16 and -18 was considered essential because of the pivotal role of these hpv types in causing cervical cancer four data sets reporting results only as x0201c high-risk x0201d or x0201c low-risk x0201d hpv were not included in the overall performance analyses one data set that used the roche amplicor assay one data set that used the seeplex hpv 4 ace assay and two data sets that used in-house pcr with agarose gel analysis the results from the initial panel validation at the 2 grls and at dkfz included qualitative characterization of hpv and human genomic dnas two of these laboratories used luminex-based assays with modified gp5 x0002b /6 x0002b primers and the third laboratory used linear array which is based on pgmy primers for the analyses no false-positive hpv type was detected in the samples at any of the reference laboratories hpv31 was not detected at the lowest concentration when present together with other plasmids in both laboratories that used gp5 x0002b /6 x0002b -based assays hpv18 was not detected at the lowest concentration in the laboratory using linear array all other hpv types were detected at the lowest concentration included in the panel except hpv39 and hpv68 which could not be detected using linear array the hpv39 plasmid used in the panel can not be detected by systems using pgmy primers as it was cloned into the vector at the binding site of one of the pgmy primers linear array and other pgmy-based assays are designed to detect hpv68 subtype b and can not detect the hpv68 prototype virus because of several mismatches all 3 reference laboratories detected hpv16 dna in the dna extraction control containing siha cells and had negative results in the negative control for dna extraction c33a cells the results from the reference laboratory evaluation advised that the panel performed as expected and the panel was then distributed to participating laboratories worldwide fifty-four of 61 participating laboratories including the three laboratories that did the panel validation submitted 84 data sets according to the timeline table x200b table2 2 two laboratories that responded after the deadline are not included in this report four data sets were generated using assays that did not discriminate specific hpv types and were therefore not included in the overall type-specific analyses presented here some participating laboratories did not perform tests for typing of all hpv types included in the proficiency panel therefore the denominator for the number of test results included in the analyses varies for the different hpv types in 37 data sets the results had been obtained using commercially available tests the most commonly used assay was linear array roche which was used to generate 15 data sets other widely used assays were clart hpv 2 genomica innolipa innogenetics pgmy-lineblot and in-house type-specific pcr luminex- and microarray-based assays table x200b table2 2 the participating laboratories included public health laboratories research laboratories diagnostic kit manufacturers and vaccine companies the number of samples analyzed for hpv per laboratory varied from 100 to 100,000 per year with approximately 40 x00025 of the laboratories performing x0003c 2,000 hpv-typing tests per year and around 40 x00025 performing between 2,000 and 10,000 hpv typings per year participating laboratories were requested to perform testing using their standard protocols accordingly the input volumes of the dna panel varied between 2 x003bc l and 50 x003bc l between laboratories data are presented by the lowest category of concentration 5 50 or 500 ge or iu proven to be detectable e.g. a laboratory using a 2- x003bc l input instead of a 5- x003bc l input that does detect 2 ge is considered to be able to detect 5 ge the sample containing 100 iu hpv16/ x003bc l was the sample that most data sets 94.9 x00025 identified correctly table x200b table1 1 single hpv types in 100 ge/ x003bc l were correctly identified without false-positive types detected in an average of 84 x00025 of the data sets hpv56 and -59 were correctly identified by less than 80 x00025 of the data sets hpv68 was correctly identified by only 37.9 x00025 of laboratories in the samples containing multiple hpv types between 50 x00025 and 73 x00025 of the data sets could correctly identify the types the negative-control sample containing only human genomic dna was correctly identified as negative by 74 of 80 data sets the proficiencies in detecting hpv types restricted to data sets testing for more than 12 hpv types are shown in table x200b table2 2 nineteen data sets were 100 x00025 proficient detecting at least 50 iu of hpv16 and hpv18 in 5 x003bc l and 500 ge in 5 x003bc l of the other hpv types tested for also when present together with other hpv types without having more than one false-positive result as the linear array assays used a large 50- x003bc l input volume the linear array system did not test for the presence of amounts below 50 iu of hpv16 and hpv18 in 5 x003bc l and 500 genome equivalents in 5 x003bc l of the other hpv types two different microarray assays were the commercial tests that had the highest number of proficient results 100 x00025 several in-house assays based on type-specific pcr and on general-primer pcr-luminex were also 100 x00025 proficient the noncommercial pgmy-lineblot assay was transferred to all who hpv labnet members in 2008 in an effort to build up testing capacity and to evaluate the ease of technology transfer of this assay the pgmy-lineblot assay was used by seven members of the who hpv labnet but with 100 x00025 proficiency in only one laboratory only one laboratory the originator had been routinely using this assay before and the other laboratories had recently set up the assay according to instructions indeed when a subsequent similar proficiency panel was sent to the who hpv labnet members two additional laboratories using pgmy-lineblot were 100 x00025 proficient and one additional laboratory was 88 x00025 proficient data not shown to be considered proficient in this study no more than one false-positive sample per data set was acceptable the numbers of false-positive hpv types detected per data set are shown in table x200b table3 3 thirty-four of the 80 data sets did not have any false-positive results whereas 12 data sets reported more than 3 false-positive results among these 3 data sets reported false-positive hpv types in more than 15 samples data sets generated by the commercial tests clart and innolipa reported more than one false-positive sample in 4 out of 6 datasets several in-house assays as well as some commercial assays that were performed by only one or only a few laboratories reported no false-positive results at all the lowest number of ge or iu of each hpv type included in the panel that was detected in both single and multiple infections by different assays is shown in tables x200b tables4 4 and x200b and5 5 hpv16 and hpv18 were the types detected at the lowest concentrations in most data sets only 1 and 3 data sets respectively could not detect the highest concentration of hpv16 and -18 in contrast for hpv52 hpv59 and hpv56 there were 25 19 and 17 data sets respectively that could not detect these viruses at the highest concentration table x200b table4 4 we report on the development of an internationally comparable quality assurance methodology that is traceable to iss an accurate and internationally comparable hpv dna detection and typing methodology is an essential component in the evaluation of hpv vaccines and in effective implementation and monitoring of hpv vaccination programs standardized methodology for evaluation of laboratory performance is fundamental to enable any comparison of the methodologies used in laboratories worldwide the major tools for achieving progress toward this goal are developing international biological standards and preparing and validating proficiency panels to qualify methods the current study has established that such international proficiency panels with units traceable to iss can be used in global studies we have also demonstrated that such studies provide a unique overview of the status of the hpv detection and typing methodologies that are being used globally and how well they perform in different laboratories overall it can be said that a majority of laboratories in this study had good performances of their hpv dna-typing tests however some limitations were revealed there was a clear tendency toward systematically different limits of sensitivity for different hpv types e.g. hpv16 and hpv18 were the types detected at the smallest amounts in most data sets only 1 and 3 data sets respectively could not detect 500 iu/5 x003bc l whereas hpv52 hpv59 and hpv56 could not be detected at the 500-ge/5 x003bc l concentration by 25 19 and 18 data sets respectively thus many surveys of circulating hpv types might systematically underestimate the prevalence of hpv52 -56 and -59 compared to hpv16 and -18 there was also a tendency toward lower sensitivity of tests when multiple hpv types were present in the samples containing multiple hpv types between 50 x00025 and 73 x00025 of the data sets could correctly identify the types present but in samples with only 1 hpv type present an average of 84 x00025 of hpv types could be identified without false-positive results this tendency would cause a systematic underestimation of the prevalence of multiple infections and would introduce a systematic detection bias in epidemiological studies with detectability being dependent on determinants of hpv acquisition e.g. a given hpv type would be more difficult to detect in high-risk groups because of the higher likelihood of other hpv infections there were a surprisingly large number of false-positive results reported with only 34/80 data sets being 100 x00025 specific the proficiency panel contained only 1 entirely hpv-negative sample the present study was designed primarily to evaluate hpv typing rather than mere hpv detection and we considered that in this context specificity should be measured primarily as an absence of detection of a specific hpv type including when other hpv types were present thus for each hpv type evaluated there are at least 39 negative samples included in the panel and 1 false-positive result thus equals x0003e 97 x00025 specificity there was only 1 indication of a systematic mistyping some linear array-based data sets reported hpv56-containing samples as positive for hpv66 but otherwise there was no single sample that had systematic false positivity for the same type in several laboratories these very common false positives are therefore not associated with the panel or with the assays used but rather appear to result from the laboratory environment and performance considering the deleterious consequences that a false-positive result may have it appears that a substantial effort for increased specificity of testing is warranted on the other hand there were some needs for improvement of the proficiency panel itself that were identified by this study the hpv39 plasmid used in the panel was cloned into the vector at the binding site of one of the most commonly used pcr primers pgmy all assays using the pgmy primer system including linear array and clart could not detect the hpv39 plasmid in the panel as this was because of the way the plasmid was constructed all these data sets were considered not to have been evaluated for hpv39 in this study the plasmid used to test for hpv68a was not full length but contained only the l1 gene we noted that linear array and all other pgmy-based assays that are indeed directed against l1 could not detect the hpv68a plasmid comparison of the sequences of hpv68a and hpv68b me180 isolate showed significant differences in the sequence corresponding to the pgmy primer binding site as the sequence of hpv68b was published before the sequence of hpv68a it appears that these systems are designed to detect only hpv68b 11 14 all data sets reporting the use of primers directed to genes other than l1 or that used the pgmy primers were considered not to test for hpv68 in this study accordingly only 29 data sets could be analyzed for detection of hpv68a and only 11 of the 29 laboratories 38 x00025 could detect hpv68a for the next who hpv labnet proficiency panel hpv39 will be recloned to change the cloning site and full-length genomes of both hpv68a and hpv68b will also be included the linear array can not exclude hpv52 when the sample is positive for hpv33 hpv35 or hpv58 some laboratories have developed a type-specific pcr for hpv52 to test hpv33- -35- and -58-positive samples whereas some laboratories 4/15 scored all sample with multiple infections containing hpv52 as negative for hpv52 4 23 this resulted in their being regarded as not proficient for hpv52 in this study four data sets generated using linear array were considered not proficient since they reported 2 or even 3 false-positive results hpv66 was detected as falsely positive in 7 of 15 false-positive results submitted in the 15 data sets using linear array 6 of these samples contained 500 ge of hpv56 that was correctly identified the detection of hpv66 in these samples was not reported by any other assay indicating that the false detection of hpv66 in hpv56-positive samples is a problem that is commonly seen with the linear array assay for two commercial tests innolipa and clart 4 out of 6 data sets were not proficient because of too many false positives innolipa could not identify hpv52 in 5 of 6 data sets on the other hand hpv52 was reported in 9 samples where it was not present the numbers of false-positive samples reported by innolipa were between 3 and 5 for the 4 laboratories that were not proficient three laboratories using clart reported 7 17 and 21 false-positive results some with more than 3 false positives in each sample four laboratories using clart could not detect hpv56 and -45 in samples with multiple types there was no consistent false positivity for any specific sample for these two assays the false positivities for these assays appeared to be randomly distributed among the samples and were always different for the different laboratories indicating that the problem is not related to the assay kit itself indeed there were examples of several laboratories that had completely proficient results using these assays a major conclusion of the present study is that differences in performance were much larger between laboratories than between different types of assays proficiency panel testing is particularly useful to stimulate a learning process for improved performance in laboratories once regular feedback on proficiency testing results is implemented improvement of performance usually follows rapidly an example of this was the results of the pgmy-lineblot assay that was recently set up in the hpv labnet several laboratories that were using this assay for the first time had suboptimal results but became proficient in a subsequent proficiency test performed when there had been more time for practice the 2 samples for evaluation of the dna extraction step before the hpv testing and typing had a surprisingly low proportion of correct results the sample containing 2,000 cells of the cervical cancer cell line siha with about 1 copy of hpv16 per cell i.e. a total of 2,000 iu of hpv16/5 x003bc l was detected in only about one-third of the data sets also a large number of data sets six reported false-positive results for the sample containing an hpv-negative human cell line this indicates that low yield in the dna extraction step potentially reducing sensitivity as well as contamination in the dna extraction step may be significant problems in the field of hpv dna testing future proficiency panels will contain a larger set of samples designed to specifically evaluate the dna extraction step before the actual hpv testing and typing there are additional steps in the laboratory detection process that are not evaluated by the present strategy notably sampling technique handling and storage natural variability of circulating virus strains pcr-inhibiting substances and naturally occurring genome modifications e.g. integration and rearrangement the hpv labnet has chosen to perform quality control for these aspects of testing by launching a confirmatory testing scheme where part of the clinical samples being tested are annually submitted to a higher-level reference laboratory for retesting 5 the alternative strategy to include clinical samples in proficiency-testing schemes was not chosen because of the need to have exactly reproducible panels with defined content that can be used by hundreds of laboratories over many years and since confirmatory testing schemes were considered to better reflect the actual testing being done it should be emphasized that the current proficiency panel study was designed to evaluate the performance of hpv testing and typing tests used in hpv vaccinology and hpv surveillance but not for evaluation of hpv tests used in cervical cancer screening 12 the demands on performance of hpv-typing assays vary depending on the purpose of the testing in vaccinology high sensitivity is needed for clinical vaccine trials as failure to detect prevalent infections at entry may result in apparent vaccine failures in contrast the clinical hpv-associated diseases such as high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia typically contain larger amounts of virus and cervical-screening programs using hpv testing do not have as high demands on sensitivity 12 guidelines for evaluations of such tests have recently been published 12 in conclusion we found that global hpv dna proficiency studies are both feasible and informative the launch of an internationally standardized methodology to analyze the specificity and sensitivity for different hpv-typing assays as well as the performance of participating laboratories to correctly identify the 16 hpv types that are most important in hpv surveillance and vaccinology is likely to greatly enhance the quality and comparability of studies in these fields members of the who hpv
