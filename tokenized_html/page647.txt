any places in the sioux empire that are good for urban exploration siouxfalls fire away not really if you x27 re looking for abandoned or intricate buildings i spent a lot of time as a teenager looking for cool buildings downtown and climbing a few and i wouldn x27 t say i found anything remotely worth going out of my way for the best urban exploration in south dakota is actually rural abandoned farm houses can harbor great caches of interesting finds we take trespassing super seriously here though and i x27 d imagine there x27 s some danger that the landowner won x27 t take kindly to your presence only you can decide what you x27 re going to do and not going to do but please always consider what you may risk a much less risky way to urbex is to gain lawful access to a building sometimes that x27 s taking some extra time to find the owner of the building you want to explore and asking permission sometimes and this is my favorite you can enter a public or semi-public building and just walk around no reason you strong class= _12fooeddl7j_rgmqn0sneu have strong to go in and out just because your business is completed this is why we had to demolish the house my grandpa grew up in idiot kids kept breaking in and we were told if we didn x27 t demolish it we would be liable if anyone were injured on the property i would not recommend abandoned farmsteads there are lots of opportunities for breaking through floors exposed nails wild possibly rabid animals broken glass and rusty debris there s a reason they re abandoned maybe look around but i wouldn t go in i hear the abandoned old main building at augustana is cool but you x27 d have to be very sneaky to get in not in the sioux falls area but san haven sanitarium in north dakota is awesome you d almost have to spend the night in bismarck or minot i don x27 t know if you x27 re looking for not geocaching but there are a lot of active caches around sioux falls and that might help get you into some new nooks and crannies 4.5k members 21 online apr 3 2011 cake day
