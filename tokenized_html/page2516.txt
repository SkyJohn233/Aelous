john lennon s lifeline how beatles fans learnt to love yoko ono 'it looks like something is not quite right with your internet connection please refresh the page and retry the telegraph search icon save h as anyone in pop culture divided opinion quite as much as yoko ono she has gone from being one of the most reviled and demonised women in rock history to an iconic elder stateswoman of the peace and love generation once she was demonised for breaking up the beatles then sentimentally admired as the widowed keeper of john lennon s flame she has been portrayed as a cacophonic wailer hanging on the coat tails of her famous husband and a daring and original avant garde artist bravely carving out her own space in the face of racist and misogynistic abuse at the age of 85 the public seems to have come around to a slightly reluctant affection for her enduring eccentricity without quite warming to her actual artistry she is still widely viewed as half of a couple even though she was a celebrated artist before she ever met the late lamented beatle and has continued to create new work in the four decades since his untimely death and she has always been a less equal half it is always john and yoko never the other way around there are reasons for this though which are not necessarily as sinister as ono s admirers might have us believe an audacious original artist in her own right ono was awkwardly thrust from the experimental margins into the mainstream spotlight by her romance with a rock star she essentially became world famous not for her own work but for its influence on another artist o n saturday channel 4 will broadcast a new documentary john and yoko above us only sky based around the creation of lennon s classic 1971 album imagine it features footage of the couple on at work and play at their palatial 72 acre ascot home tittenhurst park if you haven t seen this footage before it is sweet and intimate and in many respects astonishing a close-up portrait of two iconic figures at work and play w e see lennon making music with ono sitting by his side whispering opinions we follow them into bedroom and bathroom they are shown at a david bailey photo session where lennon gropes his wife s breasts and around a breakfast table with george harrison slurping tea and discussing the day s recording plans while most of the footage has been previously seen in documentaries and promotional movies it nevertheless combines to create a fascinating snap-shot of a moment when lennon really emerged from the shadow of the beatles to shape a new solo identity what is clear from the documentary if anyone was still in any doubt was what a profound influence ono s optimistic provocative mischievous approach to art actually had on lennon it helped shape a simpler more direct form of lyrical expression fuelled him with greater political commitment and pushed him into edgier musical and artistic positions t heirs was a genuine collaboration the language of the song imagine is all drawn from ono s art particularly her 1964 book of conceptual poetry grapefruit i wasn t man enough to let her have credit for it lennon later confessed the song expresses what i learned through being with yoko it should have really said lennon/ono. t hat the public have struggled to accept john and yoko as equal creative partners though perhaps has less to do with racism and misogyny pernicious though those forces have been than the fact that they occupied entirely different strata of the creative world it is certainly true that ono was collaborating with jazz virtuoso ornette coleman back in 1961 when the beatles were still a hamburg covers band she didn t actually sing though just set paintings on fire and cut up her clothes lennon brought ono into his music world by recording and producing her music whilst she drafted him into conceptual art collaborating on their public bed-ins and bag-ins but while ono was an interesting artist in her field lennon was a leading artist in his and they were actually completely different fields in a reverse scenario it would be a bit like picasso falling in love with an obscure songwriter and announcing that all future exhibitions would feature them both painting and singing more people will always be interested in pop music a form whose core impulse is commercial than will ever be devoted to experimental art a form that inherently challenges mainstream assumptions ono has made some interesting music over the years her art-meets-dance sonic adventures finding occasional favour with leftfield and club audiences although it is usually unrecognisable remixes that rise to the surface i t shows a certain kind of boldness that ono s inability to hold a tune or play an instrument was deemed no hindrance to her doing both on recordings with one of the most talented and popular musicians the world had ever seen i t is little wonder really that the general public has always struggled to make sense of ono she was foisted upon the world in a medium not her own lennon fans may well have come to recognise and admire ono s profound influence on his work but i doubt there has ever been any greater desire to hear her caterwauling on his records than to see him scribbling silly little cartoons at her art exhibitions let s be honest here nobody bought their joint 1980 album for the yoko ono songs the john and yoko documentary though is another reminder that they really didn t care what the rest of the world thought they were each others biggest fans lost in their own world of creativity and it is that dogged pursuit of a shared vision in the long run that seems to have earned ono the respect and admiration that really is her due john and yoko above us
