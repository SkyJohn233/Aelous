I have been visiting Malgudi since January and this review is long a due.Malgudi has been by far the best hideout from city life for me and I appreciate the extended hospitality from the staff. The ambiance of the place reminds me of my childhood days and thrills me with joy.No TV,  little phone signal, No access to technologies make me spend family time and self realization rather than watching movies, scrolling social media which has become our new family time.Foodies paradise: with home cooked food and all meals are enriched with flavors. I thoroughly enjoyed all the meals offered during  my stay and they made me realize their are 4 meals a day to enjoy and in busy city life I am used to missing most meals on daily basis.Animals provide the definition to the farm so would like to thanks all the dogs for their pampering and a grand welcome they give me whenever I come. Jesse, jasper, stephie, Max, whiskey, Chester and especially Bruno; my love to all the dogs.Staff has been amazing and would like to appreciate their attentiveness ; Suman, Aalang, Bharat ðŸ˜ƒ Thank you.Kudos!
