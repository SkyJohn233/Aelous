wuerzburg wuerzburg germany description description show less immature dendritic cells dc represent potential clinical tools for tolerogenic cellular immunotherapy in both transplantation and autoimmunity a major drawback in vivo is their potential to mature during infections or inflammation which would convert their tolerogenicity into immunogenicity the generation of immature dc from human bone marrow bm by low doses of gm-csf lowgm in the absence of il-4 under gmp conditions create dc resistant to maturation detected by surface marker expression and primary stimulation by allogeneic t cells this resistence could not be observed for bm-derived dc generated with high doses of gm-csf plus il-4 highgm/4 although both dc types induced primary allogeneic t cell anergy in vitro the estabishment of the anergic state requires two subsequent stimulations by immature dc anergy induction was more profound with lowgm-dc due to their maturation resistance together we show the generation of immature maturation-resistant lowgm-dc for potential clinical use in transplant rejection and propose a two-step-model of t cell anergy induction by immature dc citation berger tg

collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript competing interests the authors have declared that no competing interests exist establishment of immunological tolerance is the ultimate goal for causative treatments of autoimmune diseases allergies and transplant rejections while t cells are major effectors in autoimmune responses dc are not only potent inducers t cell immunity but also control t cell tolerance 1 2 there is considerable interest in the generation tolerogenic dc to control autoreactive t cells in human patients 3 with the diversity of t cell tolerance mechanisms there might not be a single tolerogenic dc type able to control all of these mechanisms therefore it is important to select or generate the optimal tolerogenic dc type that is best suited to tolerize a specific disease the various mechanisms of t cell tolerance can be subdivided into t cell-intrinsic mechanisms such as t cell anergy deletion immune deviation and t cell extrinsic control by induction of regulatory t cells t regs 4 5 6 7 t cell anergy induction has been originally described with t cell clones i.e cells that have undergone at least one stimulation before employed in the anergy experiments 8 subsequent exposure of such primed but resting cd4 t cells cross-linked to cd3 resulted in an anergic state of these cells characterized by their inability to respond to subsequent tcr signals but ability to maintain proliferative capacity by polyclonal stimulation previous studies indicate t cell anergy could be induced by a single application of orally applied ovalbumin antigen 9 or superantigen 10 although detailed molecular mechanisms of signal transduction to induce t cell anergy have been identified 4 the physiological type of antigen-presenting cell apc inducing anergy has not been investigated although it has been postulated that a single hit may not be sufficient to induce t cell anergy the need for a single or sequential trigger of naïve t cells by anergy-inducing apc remains largely unclear 11 the ability of t cell anergy induction could be achieved with cd3 antibodies in the absence of cd28 costimulation a cellular counterpart that provides tcr/cd3 signals without cd28 engagement is represented by immature dc characterized by a low expression of surface mhc ii molecules and low to absent levels of costimulation by cd80/cd86 technically the preservation of an immature state remains difficult for in vitro generated dc since murine or human immature dc spontaneously mature 12 these cells are highly sensitive to culture conditions 13 or inflammatory microbial and t cell-derived stimuli 14 15 for in vivo application of immature tolerogenic dc it is mandatory to block their maturation 16 a specific maturation block to preserve the immature dc phenotype was first described by treatment of human langerhans cells with uv light 17 thereafter many other treatments have been reported to inhibit dc maturation including il-10 tgf-β glucocorticoids and vitamin d3 analogues reviewed in 7 however only few reports exist where immature dc could be generated in vitro that were resistant to further maturation signals these methods include the combined treatment of dc with il-10 plus tgf-β 18 dexamethasone or rapamycin 19 or vitamin d3 analogues 20 dc blocked with combined il-10 plus vitamin d3 treatment have already been applied sucessfully in macaques 21 immature dc have been also applied in vivo to delay allogeneic transplantations in mice despite the positive effect on the graft survival the delay of rejection was only moderate as dc maturation occurred in vivo shown by b7-2 upregulation 22 this further underlined the prerequisite of maturation-resistance in the same allogeneic heart transplantation model pretreatment of mice with immature and maturation-resistant dc allowed a prolonged graft survival as compared to normal immature dc 22 these immature and maturation-resistant dc were generated from murine bm cells by using very low doses of gm-csf 5–20 u/ml in the absence of il-4 23 here we show that human bone marrow cells when cultured with low doses of gm-csf give rise to immature dc that do not respond to maturation stimuli anymore similarly demonstrated in the mouse model these human immature and maturation-resistant dc should be safer as compared to normal immature dc for tolerance induction in clinical applications of transplant rejection or t cell-mediated autoimmune diseases the standard source for the generation of human dc are peripheral blood monocytes while in the murine system dc are mostly generated from bm previously we described a method how murine dc can be generated with low doses of gm-csf from bm cells without undergoing spontaneous maturation these lowgm-dc remained at their immature state and were resistant to stimulation with tnf lps or cd40 ligation 23 as maturation-resistance is advantageous for the clinical application of tolerogenic dc we investigated whether such dc could be generated from human bm human bm cells were cultured following the murine protocol to generate lowgm-dc after 6 days the cells were analyzed for their expression of typical markers for mature dc lowgm-dc and control dc generated with high doses of gm-csf plus il-4 highgm/4 similar to protocols for human monocyte-derived dc yielded the same cell numbers after 6 days fig 1a however the cellular yields from highgm/4 cultures were slightly higher as compared to lowgm conditions these cells also expressed low levels of hla-dr being consistent with an immature dc phenotype fig 1b and c together under either of the two conditions 5×10 6 bm cells yielded 2.5–4.4×10 5 dc respectively upon stimulation with lps only the highgm/4 upregulated cd40 cd83 cd86 and hla-dr while the lowgm cells retained their immature dc profile fig 1c similar results were obtained by stimulation with a standard maturation cocktail tnf il-1β il-6 pge 2 cd40 ligation or with the tlr3 ligand poly i∶c not shown human bm cells were cultured under standard conditions with 800 u/ml gm-csf plus 250 u/ml il-4 or under lowgm conditions with 5 u/ml gm-csf for 6 days in rpmi+1 ab plasma a the cells were harvested and counted under trypan blue exclusion the mean values±standard deviations of 8 independent experiments are shown b the harvested cells were analysed by flow cytometry by setting gates on large cells in the fsc/ssc profile and hla-dr cells c. analysis of 3 independent experiments as gated in b mean values±standard deviations are shown d. the cells were then exposed to 100 µg/ml lps for 24 h to induce maturation or left untreated and surface stained for the indicated markers straight lines or isotype controls dotted lines cells were gated as in b to exclude lymphocytes and precursor cells the data from one experiment shown are representative of 5 independent experiments https //doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006645.g001 to further substantiate the phenotypical results we compared lowgm-dc with highgm/4-dc in their capacity to prime naïve allogeneic t cells both types of dc were used as immature cells or after treatment with various maturation stimuli while immature and mature lowgm-dc showed weak t cell stimulation capacity with the maximal response being less 35,000 cpm fig 2a in contrast highgm/4-dc showed a maximal t cell stimulation capacity of 40,000 cpm already by immature dc and could be further upregulated after maturation fig 2b dc were generated under low-gm a and standard highgm plus il-4 conditions b for 6 days stimulated with the indicated reagents or a cocktail consisting of tnf il-1β il-6 and pge 2 for 24 h and then added at titrated numbers to allogeneic t cells as represented by non-adherent fraction of pbmc of an allogeneic donor after 3 days 3 h -thymidine was added overnight to measure proliferation the data from one experiment shown are representative of 3 independent experiments values represent the mean±standard deviation error bars of triplicate cultures from one experiment https //doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006645.g002 in our murine experiments we observed the induction of t cell anergy by a single injection of lowgm-dc into allogeneic mice 23 and unpublished observations to tested whether lowgm-dc would be able to induce allogeneic t cell anergy in vitro immature lowgm-dc and highgm/4-dc were generated from bm and compared to lps-matured dc generated from pbmc all these three dc types were co-cultured with allogeneic t cells for 5 days then the t cells were restimulated with different stimuli such as high doses of il-2 or anti-cd3 either alone or in combination with anti-cd28 these conditions were also repeated with mature monocyte-derived dc mo-dc from the same donor as in the first stimulation or mature mo-dc from a third party donor under all conditions a mild proliferation of t cells could be observed which was at the same level or slightly higher than the unstimulated t cells fig 3 thus t cell anergy was not induced under all of these conditions shortening 3 days or extending 7 10 days the time interval before restimulation did not modify this result not shown allogeneic t cells were stimulated with either immature lowgm-dc or immature highgm+il-4-dc or lps-matured highgm+il-4-dc after 5 days the t cells were restimulated with il-2 or the indicated antibodies or lps-matured dc from the original allotype matdc allo or a third party allotype matdc 3rd or cells were left without stimulation control for another 3 days before 3 h -thymidine 3 h -th was added overnight to measure proliferation as shown in the flow chart the data from one experiment shown are representative of 5 independent experiments values represent the mean±standard deviation error bars of triplicate cultures from one experiment https //doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006645.g003 t cell anergy induction has been proposed by some authors to require a single tcr stimulation in vitro or a single injection of an antigen however data by other groups indicated that prestimulation of the t cells would be required to establish t cell anergy 11 many t cell anergy experiments described in the literature were performed with antigen-experienced t cell clones for t cell anergy induction in vivo soluble antigens were injected intravenously all of these in vitro studies employed antibodies for t cell treatment and did not investigate the apc type in vivo the precise type of prestimulation was never assessed the injected antigens may be endocytosed by immature splenic dc which present the peptides to t cells and establish their anergic state after about 3 days it is not clear whether a single t-dc contact is required to result in t cells anergy or several rounds of contacts are needed within this time period in fact a single encounter of naïve t cells with immature dc was not sufficient to render them anergic fig 3 to test whether t cell anergy induction in naïve t cells may depend on two stimulations we cultured the allogeneic t cells twice with the same type of dc now t cell anergy induction could be clearly observed with both types of immature lowgm-dc and highgm/4-dc as indicated by their inability to respond to a tcr signal alone anti-cd3 by their lowered capacity to respond to full t cell stimulation allogeneic mature dc and the anti-cd3/anticd28 combination nevertheless their potential to proliferate on polyclonal stimulation by il-2 or to third party-derived mature mo-dc was not affected fig 4b two repetitive stimulations of the t cells with mature dc resulted in the expected memory t cell phenotype with reduced costimulation requirement as reflected by the capacity to respond to anti-cd3 alone fig 4b in addition t cells stimulated with mature dc and followed by cd3 antibodies only showed a cytokine profile of differentiated cells such as high ifn-γ some il-10 fig 4c but almost no il-2 il-4 was never detected under all conditions not shown importantly t cells in culture with lowgm-dc and restimulated with anti-cd3 did not produce il-2 or il-10 in relevant amounts only little ifn-γ fig 4c also it did not show higher foxp3 cell frequencies in proliferated cells allo-specific as compared to non-prolifereted cells not allo-responsive this was further comparable in cultures stimultated by highgm/4 or mature dc fig 4d thus our data may indicate non-allo-specific foxp3 regulatory t cells or il-10 producing t regulatory type-1 cells 24 25 were induced after two rounds of stimulation with immature lowgm-dc or highgm/4-dc but argue for the induction of allogeneic t cell anergy a. allogeneic t cells were stimulated twice for 5 days and then for another 3 days with either immature lowgm-dc or immature highgm+il-4-dc or mature highgm+il-4-dc and then restimulated a third time for another 3 days with il-2 or the indicated antibodies or lps-matured dc from the original allotype matdc allo or a third party allotype matdc 3rd or cells were left without stimulation control for another 3 days b then 3 h -thymidine 3 h -th was added overnight to measure proliferation the data are representative of 4 independent experiments c. supernatants from the cultures shown in figure 4b were tested for their content of il-2 ifn-γ or il-10 by cytokine bead array cba the relative mean fluorescence values of the facs analysis are shown the data from one experiment shown are representative for 3 independent experiments values in bar graphs represent the mean±standard deviation error bars of triplicate cultures from one experiment d. cfse-labeled t cells were restimulated by the indicated dc type for 4 days and then stained for intracellular expression of foxp3 cells were measured by flow cytometry gating was performed on cfse cells and is plotted against foxp3 or isotype cfse low cells represent allo-responsive proliferated cells https //doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006645.g004 anergy induction in naïve t cells required two stimulations with immature dc while previous studies required only one stimulation however they used t cell clones or preactivated t cells the differential types of prestimulation by antibodies often employed cd3 stimulation without cd28 costimulation on the other hand the state of activation or preactivation of t cell clones for anergy induction was unclear therefore we wondered whether one of the two stimulation could be substituted by mature dc we exchanged the immature lowgm-dc by mature highgm/4-dc during the first or second round of stimulation the results indicate that only two subsequent stimulations by immature lowgm-dc induced an absolute unresponsiveness to anti-cd3 and a relative unresponsiveness to anti-cd3/anti-cd28 with no impairment to respond to il-2 fig 5 these data indicate that both rounds of stimulation require immature dc and can not be substituted by mature dc at any time point immature lowgm-dc or mature highgm/4-dc were generated to stimulate allogeneic naïve t cells after 5 days the t cells were restimulated with the same type of dc or in an opposite setting as indicated in the legend after another 3 days the t cells were restimulated with the indicated reagents for 3 days before 3 h -thymidine incorporation was detected to measure proliferation the data from one experiment shown are representative of 3 independent experiments values represent the mean±standard deviation error bars of triplicate cultures from one experiment https //doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006645.g005 here we described a method to generate human immature and maturation-resistant dc from bm precursor cells which was adopted from a murine protocol 23 all reagents and media that were used in this protocol were approved for gmp guidelines and thus suitable for human clinical use lowgm-dc were resistant to common maturation stimuli and induced t cell anergy in naïve allogeneic t cells when stimulated twice with immature dc highgm/4-dc were not maturation-resistant and induced t cell anergy but less profound compared to lowgm-dc untreated immature dc are extremely sensitive to all kinds of maturation stimuli even strong pipetting 26 the achievement of maturation-resistance is one prerequisite for the clinical application of tolerogenic dc plans to introduce tolerogenic dc in human clinical studies involve such maturation-resistant dc 19 the phenomenon of maturation-resistance have been observed also after treatment of dc with tgf-β plus il-10 27 dexamethasone 28 29 or vitamin d3 analogues 20 these factors were found to induce a similar maturation-resistant phenotype of dc the resulting immature dc did either not respond to conventional maturation stimuli or underwent an alternative activation that results in the production of tolerogenic cytokines il-10 tgf-β or the expression of tolerogenic surface markers ilt-3 reviewed in 7 the maturation stimuli tested on these dc maturation-resistance included tlr ligands and endogenous factors such as proinflamatory cytokines tnf or cd40 ligands which reflect very different pathways of dc activation however the underlying molecular mechanisms of dc maturation-resistance are not fully understood dc treated with vitamin d3 analogues showed an impaired nf-κb activation leading to il-12p40 gene repression 30 when dexamethasone treated dc were stimulated by lps they showed a reduced il-12 production but the il-10 production was not affected 31 indicating that an immunogenic dc maturation is blocked but an suppressive activation pathway remains functional the effect of vitamin d3 analogues on dc function seems to result in a modified dc phenotype expressing ilt-3 il-10 and inducing t regs rather than inducing t cell anergy 20 whether ilt-3 expression on dc could represent a molecule to distinguish between the induction of cd4 t cell anergy or cd4 t regs remains to be determined analyses with cd4 and cd8 t cells strongly argue for a role of ilt-3 on dc in the generation of suppressive t cells 32 we achieved a similar phenotype of maturation-resistant dc when cord blood cd34 cells were cultured under lowgm conditions however at lower cell yields not shown in contrast we were unable to apply the lowgm protocol to adherent peripheral blood monocytes as a source of dc precursors not shown this may indicate that earlier developmental stages and precursors different from monocytes are required to induce this type of differentiation in the murine system the presence of il-4 during the generation of lowgm-dc abrogated the maturation-resistant phenotype 23 and during normal highgm cultures can influence the subset generation 33 when il-4 and il-13 were added to lps during murine or human dc maturation they increased the production of the th1-inducing cytokine il-12p70 34 35 interestingly il-4 in equine dc generated from peripheral blood has been shown to mature dc by its own 36 all of these data indicate il-4 produced early during an infection by innate immune cells may prime immature dc to switch to immunity or enhance maturation induced by weak stimuli when il-4 was added to the human lowgm-dc cultures we obtained mixed results for some donors il-4 did not influence the maturation-resistant phenotype while other cultures lost their maturation-resistance not shown thus it remains to be determined how the influence of il-4 and il-13 can be counteracted before the clinical use of our lowgm-dc previous reports indicated that repetitive in vitro stimulations of human allogeneic t cells with immature mo-dc resulted in the generation of t regs 37 here we report that immature dc generated from bm induced t cell anergy but not t regs the discrepancy may be explained by different cellular sources of the dc precursors leading to different immature dc phenotypes in fact immature mo-dc express higher levels of hla-dr and costimulatory molecules cd80 and cd86 despite cd83 being negative as compared to human tissue-resident dc analyzed ex vivo from liver 38 epidermis 38 or spleen 39 40 in this respect those tissue-derived dc resemble our immature dc generated from bm both lowgm and highgm/4 t cell anergy induction has been previously shown by several groups to be mediated by immature dc while t regs require cd28 costimulation to be fully functional thus the cd80/cd86 low immature bm-dc may induce anergy while the cd80/cd86 int immature mo-dc may induce t regs on the other hand the induction of t regs is known to depend on the presence or dc production of tgf- β retinoic acid or il-10 in addition immature splenic dc to induce t regs 41 in this view there may also exist differences between dc derived from different precursors anergy induction in naïve allogeneic t cells by both lowgm-dc and highgm/4-dc required two rounds of stimulation by immature dc it has been shown effector t cells and t cell clones can be rendered anergic by a single tcr signal in the absence of costimulation but that in vivo suboptimal costimulation via cd80/cd86 may be required to anergize naïve t cells through ctla-4 11 on the other hand in vivo examples indicate anergy induction may be induced in the presence of co-stimulation independently of ctla-4 by blocking the cell cycle 42 43 also inversely we could show that in the absence of the two major cell cycle inhibitors p27kip1 and p21cip1 t cell anergy could still be induced in mice 44 delineated from these data two distinct pathways of t cell anergy induction have been proposed one via cell cycle inhibition and the other via ctla-4 45 recent data indicate that ctla-4 upregulation is mediated via the tcr as shown using cd3 antibodies 46 thus the cd80/cd86 expression by immature or mature dc may not contribute to ctla-4 upregulation in a second stimulation immature dc expressing low levels of cd80/cd86 may trigger preferentially ctla-4 on primed t cells not cd28 due to a higher affinity of ctla-4 to its ligands and limited availablity of cd80/cd86 molecules at the surface of immature dc although further analysis will be required to show a causal relationship between the ctla-4 upregulation and the requirement for a second hit by immature dc our data support a model depicting how t cell anergy can be induced by two stimulations with immature dc providing a basis for the potential physiological mechanism of t cell anergy induction via ctla-4 also in vivo our data indicate that a second stimulation with mature dc after a first stimulation with immature dc will not lead to t cell anergy a higher level of cd80/cd86 expression on the surface of mature dc as compared to immature dc may trigger cd28 as well as trigger ctla-4 when both ligands are encountered by t cells anergy induction may then be prevented by the dominant cd28 signal indeed early in vitro experiments investigating the t cell priming by cd3/cd28/ctla-4 antibody combinations indicated cd28 can outcompete negative ctla-4 signals depending on their ratio 47 alternatively other costimulatory molecules or cytokines expressed by mature dc could interfere with the negative ctla-4 signal 48 or via control of the spatial and temporal expression kinetics of cd28/ctla-4 on t cells and cd80/cd86 on dc 49 in the reverse setting when mature dc were applied as the first round of stimulation complete t cell activation may have been initiated involving many other types of costimulatory molecules and cytokines when immature dc were applied as the second round they were unable to revert the t cell activation program back into an anergic state in conclusion we provide a protocol that allows the generation of immature and maturation-resistant dc according to gmp guidelines to induce allogeneic transplantation tolerance furthermore by using dc for anergy induction which represent more physiological conditions as compared with antibody studies our data allow us to speculate how immature dc could induce t cell anergy by two subsequent stimulations involving ctla-4 signalling bm samples were received from patients with various hematological disorders who were in clinical remission following appropriate therapy and who were seen for routine follow-up that included bm analysis informed written consent of all the patients to this study was obtained before bm sample acquisition bm sampling and the experimental work occurred after approval from the ethical committee of the medical

follow-up patients with various hematological disorders the cellular yields and the functional quality of the dc was comparable in all the experiments that were performed indicating that no disease-specific factors had influenced the bm quality and thereby modulate dc function similar data regarding the maturation-resistant dc phenotype by using the protocol for lowgm-dc generation were also obtained from cord blood cd34 cells these findings further support that the diseases did influence the lowgm-dc generation as a control for the less established bm-dc cultures mo-dc were
