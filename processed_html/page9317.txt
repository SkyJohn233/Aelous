India vs West Indies 2018: Jason Holder Slams Critics Ahead Of Second Test - Sportzwiki English | DailyHunt Ahead of the second Test against India, West Indies skipper Jason Holder took a sly dig at the critics who have been criticising the visitors for their woeful performance in the first Test. West Indies turned out to be a no match all for India in the first Test at Rajkot. That West Indies will not be able to pose much of a threat to the hosts was very much on the cards. However, there spectacular capitulation has surprised many including. The visitors have not competed against at all. So far, they have failed in all the departments. Not surprisingly, they are on the brink of suffering a heavy loss.                 Asked to bowl first, they started proceedings on a good note with Shannon Gabriel dismissing KL Rahul for a duck in the very first over. But from there on, India thoroughly dominated the contest. Prithvi Shaw, Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja scored centuries while Cheteshwar Pujara and Rishabh Pant scored fifties as India posted a mammoth 649 for 9. In reply, the visitors flopped with the bat in both the innings. They were bowled out for 181 in 48 overs in their first innings as India enforced the follow-on. In the second innings, they only did marginally better, scoring 196 from 50.5 overs as they collapsed from 79 for 1. India went on to thrash the Caribbean outfit by an innings and 272 runs. Not surprisingly, the team is facing the heat from several quarters for the horror performance. However, skipper Jason Holder was in mood to take the criticism in a positive way when he interacted with the media ahead of the second Test. Pointing out West Indies' poor record in India in the last two decades or so, he said: 'We are playing the No.1 team, India, in their backyard. And history would show we haven't won a Test match here since 1994 and if you look at the players who came through West Indies cricket I think Brian Lara and these greats have been playing all that time.' Earlier this month, former skipper Carl Hooper was critical of youngsters as he said the players are only interested in cash-rich T20 leagues. And while Holder did not mention any name, he made his displeasure clear. 'Again, everyone is entitled to their opinion. I just focus primarily on what I have to do and what the team has to do. There's no point worrying about what people have to say because people will always have to say (something or the other). 'The only way we can silence the critics or try to silence them because I don't think they'll ever shut up is by playing cricket,'  he added. He went on to express his frustration over the criticism the inexperienced team is facing. 'A lot has been said about this Test team in particular; things that I am not in agreement with. Because we have beaten top sides in the last two-three series we've played. We probably haven't won as many series as we'd like. Within the last year, I think we've won two out of four or five series we've played. So I don't understand why people would be this harsh towards us,'  he said. Well, West Indies will be looking to put up a good show when the second Test gets underway on October 12 at Rajkot. They will be boosted by the return of Holder and Kemar Roach. Holder had missed the series-opener due to an ankle injury while Roach had to fly home after the death of his grandmother.  2015 DailyHunt  Privacy Policy ' + gp.name.toLowerCase() + '
