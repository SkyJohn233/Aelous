Helix Mod: Lords of the Fallen : 3DMigoto 3D Vision DX11 Fix - Updated(25/10/2017) Thanx helifax :) Thank you so mutch for all the hard work and fixes! Thanks, but sbs crashes for me. Any ideas? Thanks the previous fix worked great, but you always had to do a lot to get it work. Is that not the case anymore with this fix? Do I just download and drop on the directory and am I good to go? thanks Helifax. Yes, This should be a drop and play fix:) Thanks Helifax, love you guys! Thank you for the fix! Could you suggest something for the following please: If I uncomment the custom side by side line in order to be able to switch to T/B the game doesn ' t boot.  I have to start it with the line commented then alt-tab out of the game, uncomment the line, sync it with f10, then cycling to the required mode with f11. And have to to this every time I start the gamae, or it just doesn ' t boot. I ' m I missing something here or just have to keep rolling with this? Thanks again! Create a Link
