Kunisaki Peninsula bus tour - Usa Forum - TripAdvisor " There is also a daily guided bus tour of the Kunisaki Peninsula in Japanese, which covers  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-55869887', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Usa  Shrine and the above mentioned temples. The bus departs from  Oita  Station and also stops at  Beppu  and Usa Stations before visiting the various shrines and temples and returning via  Oita Airport  to Beppu and Oita. The cost is between 3000 and 5500 yen depending on boarding and alighting stations. " http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4724.html We are interested in taking the bus tour of Kunisaki Peninsula. As we ' ll be staying in Beppu, we ' d like to join the tour there or in Usa itself. Does anyone have any information on how to sign up? There is a link at the bottom of the page you reference. Thanks, GaijinMike, for your quick reply. We have in fact opened that link using Google Translate (regrettably, we have no Japanese). But we see no information there on where to sign up. Perhaps we ' re missing something about making reservations. We ' re also missing any indication that the bus tour circles back to  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-55872856', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Usa  station – it appears simply to go to  Oita Airport ,  Beppu , and  Oita . If we could travel to and from Usa on our JR Railpasses, we could save whole lotta money. If I’m reading right, the listed phone no. and fax no. are for reservation and enquiry. Although seats are on a reserved basis, if there are vacancies on the date of travel you can join on the spot.  They do pick-up at  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-55874677', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Usa  station but not drop-off. Their route is roughly following the letter shape “P” starting from  Oita  in the south, goes through  Beppu  and then straight up to Usa to pick up passengers. The tour follows a crescent loop of the Kunisaki Peninsula and then returns south through Beppu and Oita. If you want to take JR after the tour you can get off at Beppu or Oita station, slightly cheaper if you get off at Beppu. Thanks. We ' ll try faxing a reservation request, but II suspect it ' ll be something to be solved by phone once we ' re there. The route you describe is pretty much what we ' d made out from the link. Seems odd they wouldn ' t return to  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-55884723', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Usa  station, though – surely they must get some people coming in from Kokura to the north. As we pointed out initially, we ' ll be staying in  Beppu , so if they ' ve dragged us all the way back there, there ' s no need for JR. But we could save money if we could start and end the tour in Usa, because we can get  " free "  rides to Beppu using railpasses. Have you taken the tour yourself? If so, did you find it good? I think this bus tour is a nice way to see some things in the area. Even though it focuses on a few temples and shrines, they are quite a hassle to find on your own. The  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-55889167', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Futagoji temple  was quite spectacular during fall. The area north of  Beppu  was one of my favorite places to hang out. The  Oita  area in general is very underrated, including south of Beppu. Because of the diverse variety of things to see in the area, it took me three  rental car  trips to cover. The best source of info is the JNTO site (click on each area): www.jnto.go.jp/eng/location/regional/oita/ The  Nakatsu  section doesn ' t mention a very scenic castle in Nakatsu town which is next to the ocean, making it one of the 3 major water castles in  Japan . The tallest suspension bridge in Japan is in Kokonoe. Kitsuki is a nice, cosy castle town. Ao-no-domon is a tunnel carved out of rock by a priest which took him 30 years by hammer and chisel. The  African Safari  park outside Beppu is a blast. Rakanji temple  was one of the most interesting temples I have seen in Japan, located on a bluff and with hundreds of rice paddles. This link also shows a glimpse of  Nakatsu Castle : visit-oita.jp/sightseeing/…nakatsu.e.html Ahhh, that link reminded me of that place in Japan where I was seaching the supermarkets for karaage chicken!  While Beppu/Oita City seems quite remote, you can get there in about 2 hrs by express train or bus from  Fukuoka . It wasn ' t until my 5th trip to Beppu that I got around to the Safari Park. Last year I took a trip just to spend 3 days in Oita City itself, since it ' s often overshadowed by Beppu/Yufuin or bypassed by people heading to  Miyazaki . Dan, for people who are somewhat comfortable driving in  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-55890710', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Japan , you recommend a  car rental  for the area then? Thanks, DanL. Shall have to try to figure out how to squeeze  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-55892662', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Nakatsu Castle  and  Rakanji Temple  into an already-too-crowded schedule. Along with GaijinMike, I wonder if you have a  car rental  agency to recommend? It’s not surprising that the tour ends in  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-55900877', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Oita  as it starts there. Picking up passengers in  Usa  is more or else an additional enroute stop as it is doing an clockwise loop. I don’t quite follow your plan. If you are staying in Beppu you can join the tour there. Or are you staying the night before in Usa and want to do the tour the next day before bedding down in  Beppu !? If so you can just take the tour from Usa and though not 100% sure most long distance bus or tour bus will have luggage compartment between the wheels. Or else take an early train from Usa to Beppu, leave your luggage at your Beppu hotel and take the tour from Beppu. Direct JR from Usa to Beppu can be as short as 30 min. Sorry can’t be of much help about the bus tour as we hadn’t gone on it. For our last  Kyushu  trip we used a  rental car .  If language is a problem with the bus company, try making enquiry through Tourism  Oita (Prefecture ) at tourism@we-love-oita.or.jp, perfect English is used. Another good source is the Beppu City Tourist Information whose email is tou-te@city.beppu.oita.jp Thanks for the links to English speaking tourist offcies. We feel like proper goats having no Japanese, and these will be immensely helpful. Sorry to confuse you about the route. We ' re using  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-55901114', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Beppu  as a base for several days, making day trips to places such as  Usa . It ' s true, we could simply meet the bus in Beppu and return there. But we ' d hoped to get a little more time on the ground by getting to Usa early and looking around before meeting the bus. Besides, we ' re penny-pinchers and had hoped to save a buck by traveling to and from Usa on railpasses and paying only for the Kunisaki Peninsula loop. (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-55914268', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Kyushu  and  Hokkaido  are easy places to drive because the continents are large so space isn ' t a constraint. Hokkaido is the only place where the little boat harbors along the coast are two lane since lots of land. TooCoo  rental car  is highly recommended because their prices are same as booking yourself, but it includes the collision insurance. In addition, they have customer service in English. Budget  rental car  is usually the cheapest, however they call the bank to check your credit card so it may take you 45 '  to get out the door.
