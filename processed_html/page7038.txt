Since alcohol is a substance that is mainly metabolized in the stomach, the goal of this study was todetermine alcohol absorption before and after a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy(LSG) in the same patients.METHODS: Studies were carried out on 12 morbidly obese patients who underwent aLSG (eight men and four women). Each patient was given 3.6 ml of red wine todrink at 14% for each liter of body water mass. Alcotest values (AlcoscanAlcomate AL-6000) were measured 10 min after the wine dose had been consumed.Measurements were then repeated every 5 min until the alcohol had been completelyeliminated from the bloodstream. During the postoperatory period (median of 2.3months), the measurement was repeated with the total dose per kg adjusted to the new water body mass. The results were measured with a nonparametric analysis for repeated samples.RESULTS: The maximum average peak of the Alcotest was 2.02 g/l during thepostoperative period compared to 0.87 g/l during the preoperative period (p =0.001 Wilcoxon). At 175 min, the blood alcohol level value reaches zero (0) inall pre-operatory patients, while after surgery, an average value of 0.26 g/l wasobserved (p = 0.027 Wilcoxon). After 4 h, an Alcotest average of 0.20 g/l wasobserved in these patients.CONCLUSION: Alcohol absorption was considerably modified after LSG with higherand longer blood alcohol values for equivalent amounts of alcohol. ><
