Regenerative brakes improve the M2 Competition &# x2019;s fuel efficiency by converting inertia back into energy instead of wasting it. The S4 doesn &# x2019;t offer a regenerative braking system. In heavy traffic or at stoplights the M2 Competition &# x2019;s engine automatically turns off when the vehicle is stopped, saving fuel and reducing pollution.

The S4 doesn &# x2019;t offer a manual transmission. The M2 Competition offers an optional sequential manual gearbox (SMG). With no clutch pedal to worry about and a fully automatic mode, an SMG is much more efficient than a conventional automatic but just as easy to drive. The S4 doesn &# x2019;t offer an SMG. For better stopping power the M2 Competition &# x2019;s brake rotors are larger than those on the S4: &# xa0; M2 Competition S4 Front Rotors 15.7 inches 13.8 inches Rear Rotors 15 inches 13.1 inches For better traction and acceleration, the M2 Competition has larger rear tires than the S4 (265/35R19 vs. 245/40R18). The M2 Competition &# x2019;s tires provide better handling because they have a lower 35 series profile (height to width ratio) that provides a stiffer sidewall than the S4 &# x2019;s standard 40 series tires. For better ride, handling and brake cooling the M2 Competition has standard 19-inch wheels. Smaller 18-inch wheels are standard on the S4. For better handling and stability, the track (width between the wheels) on the M2 Competition is .6 inches wider in the front and 2.1 inches wider in the rear than on the S4. The BMW M2 Competition may be more efficient, handle and accelerate better because it weighs about 200 to 250 pounds less than the Audi S4.

The M2 Competition has 1.2 inches more front headroom and .2 inches more front legroom than the S4. If the windows are left open on the M2 Competition the driver can close them all at the outside door handle. On a hot day the driver can lower the windows from a distance using the keyless remote. The driver of the S4 can &# x2019;t use the remote to operate the windows. The S4 &# x2019;s cornering lamps activate a lamp on the front corner when the turn signal is activated. The M2 Competition &# x2019;s optional adaptive cornering lights turn the actual headlight unit up to several degrees, depending on steering wheel angle and vehicle speed. This lights a significant distance into corners at any speed. When the M2 Competition is put in reverse, the passenger rearview mirror tilts from its original position. This gives the driver a better view of the curb during parallel parking maneuvers. Shifting out of reverse puts the mirror into its original position. The S4 &# x2019;s mirror doesn &# x2019;t automatically adjust for backing. The M2 Competition was chosen as one of  Car and Driver &# x2019;s  &# x201c;Top Ten &# x201d; in 2017.
