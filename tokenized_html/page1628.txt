7cd4fc26-3330-473b-bf3a-7fc0af3b1e39 it s important to start by letting you know that i have a 1931 ford that my wife and i enjoy very much neither she nor i are car people we don t do car shows or have a warehouse full of cars we just have the one old car and we simply enjoy being together in it it was fully restored a little over 10 years ago and i do almost all the maintenance.although i like to do as much work on the car myself as possible there are just those times when you need some professional help when an engine problem developed and i spent weeks trying to figure it out but getting nowhere i knew it was that time had sought out some other shops and people but got a bad feeling from each even the ford dealer in stockton wouldn t touch a ford built in 1931 something about the age of the car creates problems a car is a car right apparently not.i learned of gold country auto restoration through one of the model a clubs i called and spoke to the general manager doug that phone conversation was an eye opener and not only did they know about model a s they had 5 of them in there right now in various stages of restoration doug told me they could take my car in a week and that my laundry list of things i wanted done wasn t a big deal.a week later on wednesday morning i loaded the car on a trailer and brought it to gold country auto restoration they helped me unload it and showed me around the shop most garages won t let you anywhere near the shop but gold country auto restoration technicians appeared very excited to have my car there and showed me some of the projects they had going on some of the cars being repaired or restored were really big money cars like a rolls royce 57 t-bird 60 s corvettes you name it a model t and some other horseless carriage looking cars were also around so i didn t feel bad leaving a 1931 with them steve was the mechanic that started on my car the moment i drove it into the garage he was eager knowledgeable and just all around a nice guy maybe he could tell i was nervous about leaving the car there or maybe he s just so nice all the time steve listened to everything i said never tried to rush me off and gave me a good feeling about this the personal tour of the shop was really something i will remember too.fast forward 2.1 weeks i called gold country auto restoration and asked about my car was told that it would be ready thursday scheduled time and a ride to go get the car arrived around 3:15 pm and the car was indeed ready and even washed doug and steve showed me some things they did and explained what they had to do to fix the motor and the steering and a couple small things brakes were checked and adjusted bearings lubed everything all road ready excellent steve even helped with a small metal plate that had come loose on the floorboard before wife and i took it for a spin to check it out just to make sure we were safe and happy with it took the car for a short spin and it drove excellent honestly the best it has ever been came back and settled the paperwork.price was a little over double the not to exceed i had set but i did ask for some more things to be done so i m not griping at all gold country auto restoration is naturally going to be more expensive than your typical corner mechanic you just have to assume that mostly because of the specialty of working on classic and collector cars but what you get for your money is knowing your classic car will be cared for despite their humorous confession that they ran the car out of gas once while playing with it and that they know old cars they obviously knew enough about mine that they checked things i had not even considered.i was given mitch s cellphone number and was told to call him if we have any mishaps on the way home or need to be towed back the trip home was fairly uneventful the car drove just perfectly mitch as a business owner made sure i was happy before i left and had his team go out of their way to fulfill my little requests like more air in the spare and an extra screw for that plate i mentioned earlier everyone at gold country auto restoration really seems to care mitch even told me that if i did break down he would come out with their enclosed car hauler trailer and get me if you have a classic car and want to bring it to gold country auto restoration for work i seriously suggest you get mitch s cellphone number and follow up with him because doug the manager simply does not return 9 out of 10 phone calls if you show up in person they will bend over backwards to help you and that says a lot so if you live close enough to gold country auto restoration to show up in person for updates etc. then you ll love the place if you re too far away to stop in yourself and will have to rely on telephone contact for things you ll get very frustrated run for your cars life hide your car women children.my name is stuart pressman i was on the committee for the pebble beach concours for 15 years i ran the show field except the movement of the cars the ramp show my favorite job there was running the tour d elegance on thursday before the show yes i started on the very first one and by year 3 or 4 i was
