When placed on top of your existing mattress, you can see an instant change in the sleeping surface. The memory foam was first designed for the airplane seats of NASA during the mid-1960s. Made of visco-elastic substance, the foam is soft in texture and is energy absorbent. The foam in the true sleeper is based on this memory foam quality and is made of two layers. Excellent Function The main function of the memory foam is to respond to the energy exuded by the body. The pressure and heat from the body is absorbed by the foam and it responds favourably by distributing the entire body weight in an even manner. The foam molds itself to the body shape, and returns to its original shape when the pressure is taken off. Benefits of the Sleeper The true sleeper is a revolutionary product that is created to conform to your body contour easily. The mattress gives you various benefits. The mattress contours are designed perfectly and it springs to its original position when the pressure is released. Ultramodern Convenience  This mattress is very convenient to use. You need not replace your existing mattress. The true sleeper with its 2‚Äù memory foam can be placed over your existing mattress, as it adapts to any space easily. Its surface is designed to match to the body shape, thus relieving pressure on the points that make you uncomfortable. With the true sleeper on your mattress, you can change your existing mattress into a high level sleep area that is well within your budget. The major problem with ordinary mattresses is that they are too solid and pressurize your body unduly. This creates circulatory difficulties and pain, disrupting your sleep. With true sleeper, you can forget the sleepless nights completely. Buying it is the best investment you can make for your body.
