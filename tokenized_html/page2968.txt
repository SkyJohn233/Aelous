most overrated hero dota2 what heroes do you think are overrated imo faceless void is really overhyped his ult isn x27 t good for teamfights and without it he x27 s almost useless because of his frailty whereas other carries like spectre anti mage and medusa can still do a ton of damage without their ult til that chronosphere isn x27 t good for team fights and backtrack doesn x27 t make void tanky dude chronosphere is shit for teamfights don x27 t ever run void with lich or witch doctor it x27 s so awful there x27 s no synergy at all kappa techies /thread yes steven i x27 d like to put an order in for 3 truckloads of upvotes i disagree with the faceless void overhype he x27 s honestly not really overrated because you rarely see him picked honestly and with farm he can basically 1v1 even 1v2 people even without his ult and if you build a team around his ult his ult is quite good ie void aa disruptor witchdoctor kunkka tidehunter are all good examples of course if you have nothing but right clickers on your team then yes he x27 s not the best option for team fights ember i think is a bit overrated both in pubs and in the pro scene in the pro scene ember does feel strong but because the team is somewhat build around him in pubs most of the time he just gets fucked in early and doesn x27 t do shit until the 40 min mark exceptions of course faceless void isn x27 t overhyped at all he is as he always was the buffs and tweaks just make him more viable away from drafting around his ult he can have very different play stiles you can rush aghs and play him like a strong disabler in the mid game or just play him greedy and farm away for late when he 1v5 and about frailty i don x27 t know what to say backtrack is pretty good 1 level is more than enough to get lucky and dodge the killing blow and also timewalk with the buff it got is a reliable escape mechanic he is strong but he needs coordination to play with your team well people pick pudge every game i play and they rarely do well so i guess pudge i don x27 t think people think pudge is overrated i don x27 t think people or at least most people think that picking pudge means they x27 re gon na win or something people just pick pudge cuz he x27 s fun i play hard carry with a group of people but when i go solo i x27 m almost always picking pudge cuz he x27 s fun any hero with a skill shot is fun really it x27 s much more satisfactory when you land a hook dismember and kill then let x27 s say antimage who x27 s just gon na blink right click for days then maybe ult if needed naga no more nerfs pls icefrog in my opinion cm i agree full disclosure i am terrible at cm 100 wr in 6.81 pro-dota medusa by some techies by majority and swm by absolute majority en chuan tress as of now gyrocopter dude needs a buff and even though it has fallen off a bit it x27 s still consistently picked but there is almost always a better alternative crystal maiden honestly can x27 t think of any 627k members 8.3k online oct 13 2010 cake day
