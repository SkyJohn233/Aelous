Dismiss  " The formula uses a Boolean iâ€¦ - Apple Community               Looks like no oneâ€™s replied in a while.               To start the conversation again, simply ask a new question. Hello! I am making a "calculator" to get price estimates for projects, depending on which processes the client wants. The rates for each process are added in a different table, and I am using checklist buttons to turn on and off the different processes. Here's an example of a formula: D3 determines whether the Modeling part of the project will be made, thus the price will or will not be calculated. If D3 is true, the result will be multiplied by 1, giving me a positive amount. If false, the result will be multiplied by 0, giving me 0, so nothing to add to the final cost there. Same applies for B4 in the same formula. This formula is repeated all over the chart, with slight modifications for adding more complex options, but it's all the same principle. Everything works out fine, but I got those blue triangles warning me of "The formula uses a Boolean instead of a number". That's fine with me, I like the use of booleans, and they are making my formulas work out great in my calculator. How can I dismiss the blue triangles? They are kind of annoying. And they don't really fit with the overall style of my calculator. I've seen someone talk about other kinds of formulas, with LOOKUP and IFs, but that's really complicated and I don't know how to do it... Especially for a simple calculator ðŸ˜€ Isn't there a way to just not display the warnings? Using version 3.6.2 on a MacBook Pro, OSX El Capitan 10.11.5 Thanks!                                                     Posted on  Jun 6, 2016 10:51 AM Hi Sinshassan, I don't know a way to escape your blue flags except to make a formula that conforms to what Numbers expects. It is not hard. My formula in D2 = IF(AND(D1,B2),C2,0) The IF statement tests both D1 AND B2. If  they are both true then it shows the value in C2 (your Modeling::High Poly Carbon #1), if one or both are false(unchecked) then 0 is shown. Give it a try. quinn                                                                   Posted on  Jun 6, 2016 11:37 AM Loading page content Page content loaded                                   Jun 6, 2016 11:37 AM in response to Sinshassan                                                                 In response to Sinshassan                               Hi Sinshassan, I don't know a way to escape your blue flags except to make a formula that conforms to what Numbers expects.
