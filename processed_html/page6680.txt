[ 5 ] Calcitriol , the active form of  vitamin D , binds to the VDR, which then forms a  heterodimer  with the  retinoid-X receptor .  This then binds to  hormone response elements  on  DNA  resulting in  expression  or  transrepression  of specific  gene products . The VDR not only regulates transcriptional responses but also involved in  microRNA -directed post transcriptional mechanisms. [ 6 ]  In humans, the vitamin D receptor is encoded by the  VDR gene . [ 7 ] Glucocorticoids  are known to decrease expression of VDR, which is expressed in most tissues of the body and regulate  intestinal  transport of  calcium ,  iron  and other minerals. [ 8 ] The VDR gene encodes the nuclear hormone receptor for  vitamin D 3 . This receptor also functions as a receptor for the secondary  bile acid lithocholic acid . The receptor belongs to the family of trans-acting transcriptional regulatory factors and shows similarity of sequence to the steroid and thyroid hormone receptors. [ 9 ] Downstream targets of this nuclear hormone receptor are involved principally in mineral metabolism though the receptor regulates a variety of other metabolic pathways, such as those involved in the immune response and cancer. [ 10 ] Mutations in this gene are associated with type II vitamin D-resistant  rickets . A single nucleotide polymorphism in the initiation codon results in an alternate translation start site three codons downstream. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein. [ 11 ]  VDR gene variants seem to influence many biological endpoints, including those related to osteoporosis  [ 12 ] The vitamin D receptor plays an important role in regulating the hair cycle. Loss of VDR is associated with hair loss in experimental animals. [ 13 ] Experimental studies have shown that the unliganded VDR interacts with regulatory regions in cWnt ( wnt signaling pathway ) and  sonic hedgehog  target genes and is required for the induction of these pathways during the postnatal hair cycle. [ 14 ] These studies have revealed novel actions of the unliganded VDR in regulating the post-morphogenic hair cycle.
