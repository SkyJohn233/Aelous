active always active hey ladies just looking for a little reassurance and advice my partner and i have been discussing for ages about moving from the midlands to devon we have friends that live in somerset and this is half way to the dream so we have pretty much decided to go for it and move there possibly in 4 weeks i will be 34 weeks pregnant anyone moved house that close to due date i have a son who is 1 already and my partner has a job lined up already also we only rent our house and have to give 1 months notice so all seems pretty easy would love to know if you can think of anything that might hinder the move i have baby brain so bad i cant think on a normal day stacey hi stacey i moved at about 32 weeks in my last pregnancy it was fine just a little frustrating i really wanterd to do stuff but no one would let me whereabouts in devon are you moving to i live in exeter good luck xxxx hey gemma i 'm sure i 'll be the same hate watching would much prefer to get stuck in we 're actually moving to taunton in somerset to start with as my partner has a job ready for him there looking forward to being all settled into the new house did u have to change midwife/hospitals etc im worried about being lectured about it going to see my midwife today so fingers crossed she will support me we are hopefully moving when i 'll be 34 weeks too i think i will go mad trying not to lift anything but maybe a little box or two wo n't hurt i will have to be involved in telling everyone where stuff goes though my midwife recomended ringing the labour ward and asking for the parent craft leader who can maybe show you around the new ward you will be giving birth on i 'm assuming it will be quite straightforward to change midwives through the reception at the new doctor 's surgery i moved house at 38 weeks pregnant with evie the new hospital and gp practice were very accommodating and simply started their own notes on me and baby whilst old ones were getting transferred also took new bloods and re-scanned me looking for any issues the move was hard because we did n't get the best movers and have since moved house twice and have paid that little extra for professional movers when we moved when i was heavily pregnant we should have paid for everything to be packed up as we did this the last time we moved and it made my life loads easier will be hoping to move into new house this time yes i feel like a nomad but hopefully this will be our house for a long time at about 34/35 weeks i would suggest getting any other children you have taken care of for the day because it can be upsetting for them take care of yourself and do not try and lift boxes good luck hope all goes well xxxxx thanks for the support girls its hopefully going to be quite straight forward then as soon as we arrive in the new town i will pop to the gp 's and register so that my notes can be transferred straight away also hoping for a homebirth as i bought my birth pool already so thats another thing to tackle but im sure it will be great i feel quite positive about it all now hey well my current house is up to let and im putting down a deposit on my new house today we rent so nothing major its all happening .countdown begins to the big move exciting and scary all in one x tell me about it i 'm moving out of my rental flat on thursday at 32 weeks and should have been moving to the next town covered by the same hospital and midwives but as the vendors concealed an unsafe rotten floor and as my surveyor did n't pick up on it i ca n't move into my house and am getting carted off to scotland to finish my pregnancy at my mum 's house 50 miles away from the nearest hospital with a whole new set of midwives and ante-natal care moving house is so stressful good luck with it all i am moving at 38 weeks pregnant leaving it a little late but i dont have any choice i have friends who are willing to help move all the stuff and i am planning to pack all my stuff when i start mat leave its very exciting but also nerve wracking just hope bump stays put til 40 weeks xxx its such a relief to hear that im not the only person going through this im excited about the new life im going to have and be able to give to my babies but at the same time im scared hope everything goes well for you all heres to a happy move wont be long and our babies will be here xx hello we 've just moved house last week i think physically it 's not so much a hardship it 's just the emotional and psychological side of being in a completely new environment with lots of things to do people to phone things to organise etc have had a couple of hormonal meltdowns this week but nothing that would have put me off moving my only advice is allow yourself a little time to adjust do n't overdo it and try to make sure that there 's as little as possible to do once you 're in energy companies t.v etc good luck sara this product is displayed based on comments within this post please flag if
