how to start aloe vera cultivation aloe vera aloe barbadensis is a popular medicinal plant it belongs to the liliaceae family it is a perennial plant growing to the height of 1½ 2½ ft. its leaves are long and thick juicy with a wheel like phylotaxy the two sides of the leaves have thorny structure with a thorny tip the inner substance of the leaves is jelly like with bad odour and bitter in taste the length of the leaves ranges from 25-30 cm while the breadth ranges from 3-5 cm normally it flowers during october to january and the long inflorescence has a large number of small pink flowers all around fruits are developed from february to april aloe vera is normally not propagated through seeds vegetative propagation is easy and convenient of late because of the skyrocketing price of allopathic medicines with its known side effects medicinal plants and ayurvedic medicines are becoming popular world trade worth about 80 million us dollars exists now and this is likely to increase by 35-40 percent within five years the us dominates the market 65 while india and china have a share of 10 percent each which could be enhanced by its commercial cultivation the soil and climate aloe vera is found to grow in hot humid and high rainfall conditions it is grown in all kind of soils but well-drained soil with the high organic matter is most suitable it grows well in bright sunlight shady conditions result in disease infestation and it is highly sensitive to water stagnation therefore well-drained high land should be selected for its cultivation a rainfall ranging from 1000 – 1200 mm is ideal for aloe vera cultivation since it is difficult to grow aloe vera from seeds seedlings are normally raised from roots of the plants sucker itself can be used as seedlings as in banana rainy season is ideal for sucker plantation a spacing of 1.5 x 1 ft 1 ft x 2 ft or 2 ft x 2 ft is followed land preparation about 2-3 ploughings and laddering are done to make the soil weed free and friable land leveling is then followed along the slope a 15-20 ft drainage is made how to plant aloe vera know when to transplant aloe plants have relatively short roots and heavy leaves so they are commonly moved to a heavier pot when they become top-heavy and tip over if aloe vera runs out of space for its roots to grow it may start to produce pups that can be moved to their own pot if you are more interested in the adult plant growing than producing new plants transplant it to a larger pot before the roots begin to circle the walls of its container give the plant adequate sunlight and warmth aloe vera plants prefer 8–10 hours of sunlight a day while they grow best in warm or hot temperatures they are capable of surviving cooler seasons in a more dormant state however they may suffer harm if exposed to temperatures below 25ºf -4ºc plant the aloe vera in well-draining soil aloe vera plants are adapted for survival in dry conditions and may rot if planted in soil that collects standing water use a cactus potting mix or create your own mix using equal parts soil sand and gravel if planting aloe vera in a container make sure the container has a hole in the base for water to drain through cover root ball when planting but do not let the leaves touch the soil place the aloe vera root ball just below the soil surface if any of the thick green leaves are partially buried or touch the soil they may rot cover the surface of the soil with gravel or pebbles optional place a layer of small rocks around the base of the aloe plant to keep the soil in place and reduce evaporation this is not required for your aloe plant to thrive so you may leave the soil exposed if you prefer the appearance white stones will reflect warmth from the sun to the base of the plant which can be a good idea if you do not live in a hot climate do not water for the first few days after planting before you start watering give the aloe plant a few days to repair any roots that may have been damaged during planting watering damaged roots increase the chance of root rot aloe plants store plenty of water in their leaves and should not be harmed by the lack of water during this time give it a light watering the first one or two times you water if you would like to be extra safe providing daily care and troubleshooting water whenever the soil is dry during the growing season during summer or any time the weather is warm and sunny aloe plants will grow fastest with regular watering however it is much easier to overwater aloe plants than to dry them out so do not water until the soil has dried out to a depth of 3 inches 7.5 cm water infrequently during cold season aloe plants often go dormant during winter or when the weather is cold for a prolonged period of time unless you are keeping them in a heated room year round you should only water them once or twice a month during this period fertilize once a year or never aloe plants do not require fertilizer and overuse can harm the plant or cause it to grow in an unhealthy manner if you wish to encourage growth use low nitrogen high phosphorous low potassium fertilizer such as a 10:40:10 or 15:30:15 apply once a year in late spring at the start of the growing season clear weeds carefully the soil around the aloe plant should be free of grass and weeds remove these regularly if the plant is outdoors but do so carefully because good aloe soil is loose and sandy it is easy to damage the roots with vigorous weed-pulling increase sunlight if the leaves look flat and low if the leaves are growing flat and low increase the sunlight aloe vera leaves should grow upward or outward at an angle toward the sunlight if they are low to the ground or growing flat outward the plant is probably not receiving enough sun move it to a sunnier area if it is indoors consider keeping it outdoors during daylight hours decrease sunlight if the leaves turn brown if the leaves turn brown decrease the sunlight while aloe is hardier than most plants when it comes to sun exposure it is still possible to burn the leaves if the aloe plant turns brown move it to an area that receives shade during the early afternoon increase water if leaves look thin/curled if the leaves are thin and curled increase water the thick fleshy leaves store water that the plant uses in times of drought if the leaves are looking thin or curling water the aloe plant more frequently be careful not to overcompensate water should drain quickly through the soil to prevent root rot which is difficult to stop stop watering if the leaves turn yellow or fall apart yellowed or melting leaves are suffering due to excess water stop watering altogether for the next week or two weeks during the dormant season and water less frequently once you resume you may remove any discolored leaves from the plant without much chance of harm although it is best to use a disinfected knife facebook twitter linkedin whatsapp email
