beautiful all year round but there is nothing like spending a summer in vermont burlington is a biking/long-boarding friendly town so i always feel safe when i take my board or bike out to do some shopping or cruise around town the lake at the bottom of the hill lake champlain offers great views a wonderful spot for relaxation fishing and even swimming in the future i see the housing
