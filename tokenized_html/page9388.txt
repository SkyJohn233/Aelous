to find out if you 're affected and lock things down by matt burgess if you were asked to log back into facebook the last time you opened its app or website there 's some bad news facebook 's disastrous 2018 has got a whole lot worse the company has admitted that hackers managed to gain access to its network and compromise 50 million accounts but the number of people implicated in the incident may be much higher on friday facebook logged out a total of 90m accounts from all of its apps and third-party services that use facebook for logins after it discovered access tokens for the accounts had been stolen that means facebook-owned instagram and whatsapp are also affected along with apps and services such as tinder that authenticate users through facebook access tokens are unique strings of numbers that can be used to identify individuals apps or pages on facebook once you have logged in to your facebook account an access token is created that confirms your identity to your device the attackers accessed 50m access tokens but facebook also reset the tokens of 40m other accounts as a precaution and it seems nobody was immune to the attack with facebook confirming that ceo mark zuckerberg and coo sheryl sandberg both had their accounts compromised by nicole kobie what makes the attack on facebook particularly bad is that the access tokens could be used to access third-party websites where facebook had been used to login facebook introduced its 'single sign-on feature in 2010 and its widely used by apps such as tinder spotify and airbnb the build-up to the data breach started in july 2017 facebook says and the company 's pivot to video caused the problem when the firm made changes to its video uploading feature three bugs were introduced that were all manipulated to cause the eventual vulnerability the vulnerability existed within facebook 's view as feature – which lets people see what their account looks like to others ironically the view as tool was originally designed as a privacy enhancing feature the way it worked allowed you to select a facebook friend for instance a family member and then view your profile as if you were them if you had changed the privacy settings of a photo or status update so that the family member could n't see it view as was designed as a way of checking it the first bug on facebook made its video upload tool accidentally show up on the view as page a second bug resulted in the uploader generating the access code and finally the view as page also generated an access code for whoever the hacker was looking for facebook first spotted unusual activity within its network on september 16 and then uncovered the attack on september 25 over the following two days it called law enforcement and fixed the vulnerability at the moment facebook does n't know how long the attackers were in its system there 's the potential facebook detected their activity incredibly quickly but also the possibility the attackers could have been compromising user information since the vulnerabilities were introduced fourteen months ago in 2017 by laurie clarke critically for european users facebook has been in touch with the data protection commissioner in ireland – where it is registered – to inform it of the breach this will be the first data protection incident from one of the major tech companies since the enforcement of europe 's general data protection regulation gdpr in may gdpr gives regulators the power to issue huge fines but this is yet to be tested in a statement the irish data protection commission said facebook has n't given it many details yet it is concerned that despite facebook discovering the breach on tuesday it has n't been able to clarify the nature of the breach and the risk for users at this point facebook says it does n't know who stole the access tokens but the firm is now working with the fbi and law enforcement in addition it does n't know whether the accounts were misused or if any information was accessed having access tokens could have meant hackers had full control of compromised accounts in a call with reporters facebook said whoever attacked it did try to query information from its profile api but it is n't sure how successful this was the api can pull in information that is shown on profile fields such as gender names and hometowns facebook has said no credit card information was taken initially the company did not directly inform users who had their access tokens compromised the only way at present to tell if your account may have been involved is if you were mysteriously logged out facebook has now said it will be putting messages at the top of people 's newsfeeds until you see this message it 's likely you were in the 50m compromised accounts or 40m that had access codes reset as a precaution if you have recently been logged out so what should you do if facebook logged you out the company itself says passwords were n't taken and there is n't any need for them to be reset but if you use the same password across multiple accounts or use something simple this is a good opportunity to improve your general security you can find
