christmas trees be inspired by holiday decorating ideas i got this tree delivered today put it up and it s great i looked at a similar tree at another store and it was 300 it s very well lit has alot of lights options it fills out nice with a little time rearranging branches and it s a nice size it has the c6 size lights and it is very bright when lit up luv it this tree is just wonderful very easy to put togather just put the stand down then put the 3 sections togather then connect the cables and plug in 240 white led s and 240 multi color led s 11 functions it is very bright and very low power my wife and i both think it is the best one we have ever had in our 35 years looked everywhere locally and could not find a tree with similar features anywhere even at walmart decided to buy this tree from walmart.com and it was just what i was looking for.480 led lights over 1500 tips and all the other features that i wanted excellent tree for the cost took about 10 days to have shipped to my local walmart store this is a great tree it is nice and full just take your time to open and arrange all of the branches it goes together very easily it is just three sections to put together the lights are nice and bright and have so many settings to choose from love the led lights love to be able to choose different light settings for different looks it is a really nice looking tree the stand is nice and sturdy too you just have to twist the screw when the tree is inserted much easier than trying to put the stand together too really a lovely tree for your home my son wanted this tree because of the lights at the store i didnt like it but once i got it home i fell in love with it.it does take 2 ppl to carry into the house i love love it i absolutely love this tree i love how it changes between all the colors and has white lights too.the only issue i found with this tree is how hard it is to find replacement bulbs they are c5 and they are not carried in the stores or on walmart.com i had to google them.otherwise i would recommend this tree to everyone love this tree the lights are large and very bright love the light variations easy set up looks full when branches are arranged very satisfied when i first put up the tree the multi color lights in the middle section did not work i had to pull out all the colored lights and test them to find which light was not working the light bulbs are very large it is a bit over-powering there is no on off switch so you must unplug the tree each time and the power box does not remember which setting you had it on so you have to find the light function you like each time.the price was average for a pre-lit art tree but if i find a better tree next year i may toss this one i was so excited to get this tree home and put it up once i got it up the middle and top section of white lights did not work i tried everything and even called the customer service line they were going to send me a new middle section but it would take 7 business days i am just going to take it back to walmart and see if i can return it also the lights are very large i am not sure i would have liked it completely anyway they are more like old fashioned bulbs i prefer to have the lights buried in the tree and not seen would rate 0 if i could didn t last one season says on box inly one light will go out at time not true no customer service number to call and complain only got one season out of it stored indoors and right at the beginning of this season half the lights are out and by christmas even more went out customer q a get specific
