WARNING: spoilers below I was saying ‘uh-oh’ before episode three of  The Fall  had even started, as the BBC announcer said: “Bringing Spector to justice is about to become even more difficult.” But the warning was for Detective Superintendent Stella, as we viewers already knew serial murder suspect Spector had supposedly lost his long-term memory – conveniently just enough to cover all the killings. Well, all the killings we knew about. The episode opened with a forensic scientist and Stella separately poring over the sinister drawings of women that the police found in a series of exercise books in Spector’s lock-up, along with ladies’ underwear – a LOT of ladies’ underwear. And we can’t really imagine it was for him! One woman was drawn in underwear with her hands tied, another was prostrate on the ground with ‘dirty whore’ written on her back. On top of bondage, they detailed auto-asphyxiation. Not the kind of graphic novel you would ever pick off the shelf. So Stella sent her team off to hunt for the women, with just their initials to go on. For instance: “A.S., who might be a journalist, who seems to wake up late every day and skip breakfast, who wears a cream robe after her bath, and sometimes doesn’t completely close her bedroom curtains.” Hmmmm. Bit close to home. With her laser eyes now glazed and dulled, and her voice growing ever croakier, Stella just about summoned up the strength to muse: “Are they just fantasies that sustain him, feed his appetites? Or are they a record – of nine more murders?” Later on, dishy DS Anderson (who we are not seeing nearly enough of) came up with some intriguing goods relating to a man convicted of murder who was at the same children’s home as Spector. Wrongly convicted? Two killers? More of this twist to come. We had another possible flicker of an insight into steely Stella’s hidden human side when she interviewed traumatised kidnap victim Rose Stagg: “Rose, remember you survived, you got through it, it’s in the past,” she whispered, suddenly looking downwards, as though talking to herself… or about herself. Meanwhile, back at the dingy hospital – which seems to exist in a permanent night zone – a doctor continued to test Spector’s memory. He remembered his in-laws, that his own mother died and that his father wasn’t his father. Another possible clue to his twisted psyche. “When I was growing up he was known as Peter Baldwin. I thought that man was my real father, till he left us. My mother told me he wasn’t my real father, just a man.” And though he’d heard of Facebook, he had no idea what Twitter was. “So you don’t know what a Tweet is, or Tweeting?” said Dr Walden. “The sound a bird makes?” he replied, reminding us of the far-far away era when we all thought that. As to his moral character, the look Dr Walden gave him when he said quizzically: “I feel like I’m an all right person?” was utterly priceless. He has so far convinced the doctors, but the police chiefs and DPP were another matter when Stella broke the bad news of Spector’s memory loss to them. ACC Burns asked the obvious question: “Are we meant to be taking this seriously?” ’Fraid so, guv. But tough DPP Lowden wasn’t phased: “The law does not concern itself with the present state of mind of the criminal defendant, only with the state of mind at the time the crime was committed, and Spector’s was clearly conveyed in his confession… he will be held accountable.” Clearly an optimist. Those final five words are fatal. And Spector certainly seemed to be on the ball looking for escape routes when he was taken down a hospital corridor for his appearance in court via video link. But he’s about to be moved from the hospital to a forensic clinic to face a whole new expert, Dr August Larson, and from what we have seen so far there are no flies on him! On the pitifully sad side of things, the human Stella also tried to persuade them to drop the prosecution against Spector’s shattered wife Sally, for perverting the course of justice, but failed. This led to bleak shots of the now zombified Sally drugging her children with hot milk and taking them on quite the wrong kind of trip to the seaside. If she plunges them all into the waves that will no doubt send Spector over the edge, too, as the episode also showed just how much he adores his daughter. This series takes the slow-drip approach to piling on the agony. The painful pace was slower than ever at this halfway point, leaving us feeling we are crawling through the plot on our stomachs, which is starting to get annoying. Like those twittering birds, we are being tossed mere breadcrumbs where other crime dramas serve up full loaves. So once again we were left hungry for more, wondering just who is heading for that Fall? Please, please let the next three episodes bring some real action to show us!

After her comedy-writing stepfather told her in childhood she would never get paid for watching television, Sarah Bond grew up to prove him very wrong (to his delight). After earning her journalistic stripes at the Brighton Evening Argus and Radio Times, she has written about TV for most of her career, mostly at the Daily Express and Daily Mirror, as well as writing film reviews for The People. Having also read every Agatha Christie book in her youth, she is potty about crime dramas, and soaks up plots faster than Pinot Grigio. Among the highlights of her career was getting a taste of life on the mean streets with the New York police, and meeting her heroine, Ruth Rendell, on location with Inspector Wexford.
