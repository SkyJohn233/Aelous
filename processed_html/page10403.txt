All five living former US presidents make rare appearance together | US news | The Guardian Presidents gather for fundraiser for those affected by hurricanes that struck Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands Presidents gather for fundraiser for those affected by hurricanes that struck Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands Tom Dart  in Austin Sat 21 Oct 2017  21.58 EDT Last modified on Tue 11 Sep 2018  09.31 EDT The five living former US presidents made a rare appearance together on stage on Saturday night at a fundraiser for those affected by recent hurricanes that struck Texas,  Florida , Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. It was a show of unity and compassion after a week in which  Barack Obama  and George W Bush broke an unwritten rule to deliver implicit criticism of the present occupant of the White House. While neither mentioned Donald Trump by name, Bush gave a speech in New York expressing concern that “bigotry seems emboldened” in a climate of cruel rhetoric and nativism, while Obama referred to the “politics of division” and “folks who are deliberately trying to make folks angry” at Democratic  campaign stops  in New Jersey and Virginia. Politics was set aside for the sold-out concert at Texas A & M University’s Reed Arena, however, as Bush, Obama, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and George HW Bush were given a rapturous welcome by the audience. Both Bushes live in Texas and the 41st president’s  library and museum  is on the A & M campus. The event, Deep From The Heart: The  One America  Appeal, featured a host of country and gospel music stars. It was launched last month after Hurricane Harvey battered Texas and expanded when Hurricane Irma hit Florida and Hurricane Maria devastated parts of the Caribbean, together causing several hundred deaths and billions of dollars in damage. Trump, whose response to relief efforts in Puerto Rico has come under fire, has frequently denigrated Obama and earlier this year baselessly claimed his predecessor in the Oval Office ordered Trump Tower to be wiretapped before the 2016 election.  Last Monday he intimated Obama and other former presidents treated the families of dead military members with a lack of respect . However, he recorded a two-minute video message for the appeal which was rather more collegial in tone. “Now, as we begin to rebuild, some of America’s finest public servants are spearheading the One America Appeal. Through this effort, all five living former presidents are playing a tremendous role in helping our fellow citizens recover,” he said. “[First Lady] Melania and I want to express our deep gratitude for your tremendous assistance. This wonderful effort reminds us that we truly are  one nation , under God, all unified by our values and our devotion to one another.” … in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation. Democracy is under attack, as is civility, truth and normal forms of political behaviour. The White House harbours white nationalists, incites fear and prejudice, undermines intelligence agencies, courts foreign influence in US elections and undermines the judiciary. The need for a robust, independent press has never been greater and with your help we can continue to provide fact-based reporting that offers public scrutiny and oversight.  These are perilous times. The administration ' s willingness to deploy untruths, violent speech and hateful attacks on the media are now commonplace. This is why we are asking for your help so that we can continue to put truth and civility at the heart of the public discourse.  " Next year America faces an epic choice – and the result could define the country for a generation. It is at a tipping point, finely balanced between truth and lies, hope and hate, civility and nastiness. Many vital aspects of American public life are in play – the Supreme Court, abortion rights, climate policy, wealth inequality, Big Tech and much more. The stakes could hardly be higher. As that choice nears, the Guardian, as it has done for 200 years, and with your continued support, will continue to argue for the values we hold dear – facts, science, diversity, equality and fairness. "  – US editor, John Mulholland On the occasion of its 100th birthday in 1921 the editor of the Guardian said,  " Perhaps the chief virtue of a newspaper is its independence. It should have a soul of its own. "  That is more true than ever. Freed from the influence of an owner or shareholders, the Guardian ' s robust independence is our unique driving force and guiding principle.  We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. We hope to surpass our goal by early January. Every contribution, big or small, will help us reach it.  Make a year-end gift from as little as $1. Thank you.

Glad to see that HW is still kicking (in a manner of speech). Where ' s Trump? Oh right, he ' s not our POTUS  So who ' s running the country? I like the two Bushes more now as former presidents, and Clinton less than when he was POTUS. ... are you sure? Trump would not even qualify as the shoeshine boy for these five. Remember what happened to the shoeshiner in Goodfellas... Now go get your fxxng shine box ☺Aces Class v Arse. No prizes for guessing who the Arse is. It freaks me out that Bush Senior  &  Junior seem so......... I don ' t know the words exactly, but not so bad anymore. I agree - it ' s very unsettling! Yet all those dead Iraqis are still dead. I agree too and it ' s the opposite for me with Clinton. I quite liked him as president but now think of him as a greedy, opportunistic sleazebag. One can only hope that Trump will be a postscript one day soon.
