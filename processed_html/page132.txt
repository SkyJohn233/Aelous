On basis of the profile of resistance to antimicrobials, 13  Salmonella     strains were selected which belonged to the serovars Muenster (7), Derby (4),    Typhimurium (1), and Braenderup (1). They were isolated from healthy swine as    well as from the abattoir environment in the state of Rio de Janeiro. All strains    of  Salmonella  were subjected to bacterial conjugation, and the  E.    coli  K12 Nal r  Lac +  F standard strain was used as receptor,    with the purpose to verify the ability to transfer the resistance marks. Gene    transfer phenomenon was detected in seven strains, and except  Salmonella Typhimurium    which transconjugated to Sm, Tc and Su, the remaining ones were characterized    by transferring mark Su only. By plasmidial analysis of strains used and their    respective transconjugants, 63 Kb plasmid was found, which was probably related    to  S . Typhimurium resistance.

INTRODUCTION Salmonella  serovars other than those related    to disease are being identified in clinically healthy swine by the time of slaughter    (Costa et al. 1972, Zebral et al. 1974, L zaro et al. 1997). This fact    has implications on Public Health, in so far as a considerable number of such    serovars are also isolated from outbreaks of human salmonellosis (Hofer  &     Reis 1994, Lirio et al. 1998).  Its significance does not only lie on the attributes    of virulence, but also on the capability of resistance to antimicrobials shown    by some strains, as well as of the transfer of this feature through plasmids    (Ishiguro et al. 1980, Simmons et al. 1988, Heffernan 1991).  The quick and widespread drug-resistance mediated    by plasmidial genes in  Salmonella  isolates has been reported worldwide.    During the past few decades, various countries have witnessed a significant    increase in human isolates of multiresistant salmonellae (Holmberg et al. 1984,    Carvalho  &  Hofer 1989, Rivera et al. 1991, Asensi  &  Hofer 1994, Ling    et al.1998), as well as animal isolates (Hampton et al. 1995, Millemann et al.    1995, Alaniz et al. 1997, Izumiya et al. 2001).  Of particular interest is the fact that most    plasmids acquire their resistance genes through transposons, whether from an    other plasmid in the strain, from the chromosome or plasmids carried by other    bacterial strains which are present in the host (Threlfall  &  Frost 1990).    In the light of this, research was carried out which concentrated essentially    on R factors of  Salmonella , by means of conjugation tests (Timoney 1978,    Vinhas  &  Almeida 1984, Simmons et al. 1988, Sant'Ana et al. 1995).  In view of the complexity of the factors associated    with the dissemination of resistant  Salmonella  strains, this paper has    the purpose of assessing the capability to transfer marks of resistance to antimicrobials    by means of bacterial conjugation as well as by analysis of the plasmidial profile    of  Salmonella  isolated from clinically healthy swine, and also originating    from the environment where these animals were slaughtered, in the state of Rio    de Janeiro. MATERIALS AND METHODS  For the conjugation experiments 7 samples were    selected belonging to serovar Muenster; 4 samples of serovar Derby, one belonging    to serovar Typhimurium , and one to serovar Braenderup. These were isolated    from swine and the abattoir environment; they were resistant and/or multiresistant    to sulphonamide (Su), streptomycin (Sm) and tetracycline (Tc) ( Table    1 ).  Conjugation experiments.  For the determination    of R factors in the samples under study, the methodology used was the one described    by Dias  &  Hofer (1985). Conjugation was performed using as recipient     Escherichia coli  K12 55, F -  Lac +  Nal r ,    susceptible to all drugs except nalidix acid. Transconjugants were seleted on    MacConkey agar (Oxoid) containing the antimicrobials to which the standard strain    was originally sensitive. The resistance patterns of transconjugant strains    was confirmed through the disc diffusion method according to NCCLS (1998), and    considering the original profile of the corresponding donor colony.   Plasmidial analysis.  The analysis of    the plasmidial contents regarding the original strains and their respective    transconjugants was performed by the alkaline lysis method of Birnboim  &     Doly (1979), modified by Sambrok et al. (1989). The plasmidial DNAs of  E.    coli  V 517 and 29R861 were included as molecular weight controls.  RESULTS Table 2  shows the conjugation    positivity in seven (53.84%) out of the 13 donor strains, which evidences the    total transference of model Su, Tc, Sm on  S . Typhimurium and partial    transfer of mark Su in regard to serovars Derby and Muenster.  Regarding the transfer degree determined in    salmonellae by view of the growth of transconjugant samples in dilutions 10º,    10 -1 , and 10 -2 , it was found that from the seven transconjugants,    the isolation of transconjugating up to dilution 10 -2  was obtained    only with  S.  Typhimurium; the others were characterized by reaching up    to dilution 10 -1 .  The antimicrobial susceptibility tests confirmed    the transfer of resistance marks in all of the transconjugant strains.  In  Table 3  are listed plasmids    transferred by the conjugation process between  Salmonella  (donor) and    (receptor)  E. coli  K12 55 (LR1). Despite the donor serovars Muenster    and Derby, which showed resistance transfer to mark Su for  E. coli , the    analysis of plasmidial DNA in transconjugant samples did not reveal plasmids    which were evidenced in the donor samples. Regarding  S.  Typhimurium (strain no. 76),    marks Tc, Sm, and Su were transferred, and the analysis of transconjugants ( Fig.    1 ) revealed the presence of plasmids showing approximate sizes (Kb) of 63-3.75    and 3.45 Kb for transconjugant Sm (T76Sm x LR1), and only the 63 Kb plasmid    on transconjugants Tc and Su (T76 & c x LR1, and T76Su x LR1). It is noteworthy    that the antimicrobial susceptibility test in order to confirm transfer of R    factors revealed simultaneous resistance to marks Sm, Tc, and Su in the three    transconjugants resulting from  S. Typhimurium . DISCUSSION The information contained in the literature points    out the transfer of genes among bacteria by means of conjugation, in varied    environments as well as in the intestinal tracts of humans and animals (Smith    1969).  Although laboratorial experiments do not exactly    reproduce even under simulated conditions the complexity existing in transfer    processes occurring  in vivo , they may constitute an important tool for    making such inferences.  The negative result in the conjugation of the    six  Salmonella  Muenster strains, as well as the absence of transconjugants    for marks Sm in S. Muenster (no. 8), and Sm, Tc in  S . Derby, may be related    to one of the following features: the genic-chromosomic feature of these determinants;    the non-existence of the transfer factor; the interference of nalidixic acid    with selective plates for transconjugants; the inability of plasmid reception    of the standard strain used (Barbour 1967); or even plasmid loss during handling    of the samples.  The hypothesis is also admitted that these strains    carry thermo-sensitive plasmids R encoding a resistance to Tc and Sm, which    are effectively transferred at 25º C. Factors related to resistance to tetracycline    seem to be effectively transferred outside the body, thereby decreasing transfer    at 37ºC (Timoney 1978). This may account for the difficulty of  in vivo     transfer on the part of plasmids bearing resistance of animal origin into the    flora residing in man's intestine (Smith 1969). A wide distribution of thermo-sensitive    plasmid in salmonellae isolated from swine was noted by Ishiguro et al. (1980)    in Japan.  Analyzing  Table 3  it was    found that only  S.  Typhimurium was capable of transferring R- plasmid    to  E. coli  . The close association between marks Su, Tc, Sm, along with    the finding of simultaneous transfer to  S. typhimurium  transconjugants,    suggests that such genic expression may be determined by the same plasmid (63    Kb), although there have been detected two additional plasmids (3.75 and 3.45    Kb) on transconjugant Sm of  S.  Typhimurium (T76Sm x LR1). This feature    is found in the literature in so far a non-conjugating plasmid may be transferred    to a receptor cell by cooperative action of a conjugative plasmid when they    are present in the same cell. With regard to plasmids with relatively high molecular    weights and encoding resistance to antimicrobials, in  Salmonella  Typhimurium    these appears to exist a 40 Kb plasmid associated to resistance to amoxicilin,    streptomycin, tetracycline, chloranphenicol, and sulfametoxazol-trimetroprin    (Hansen et al. 1964), and another 80 Kb plasmid encoding resistance to marks    Ap, Sm, Su, Tc (Hampton et al. 1995).  As to the absence of plasmids in transconjugants    of  S . Muenster and  S.  Derby, the hypothesis can scarcely be admitted    that the determinant of resistance to mark Su is encoded by a large plasmid,    which has not been demonstrated through the methodology employed. For this purpose,    various methods and procedures were set forth, the outstanding being the one    developed by Kado  &  Liu (1981), which is the most convenient for extraction    in view of plasmids with high molecular weight. Another explanation for this    phenomenon could be the outcome of integration of the resistance-plasmid in    the receptor's chromosome (Madigan et al. 1997); or, still, because of the poor    stability during the storage period between tests.  The ease of  in vitro  transfer has led    to the conclusion that similar pattern of resistance to antibiotics in different    intestinal bacteria are mediated by the same resistance plasmid (R factor) and    has the same origin (Cherubin 1981). In contrast, Avril et al. (1977) have shown    that the same resistance pattern is expressed by different episomes, and in    the same way in different  Salmonella  serovars. Whenever a  Salmonella     bearer is being treated with antibiotics and the microorganism develops a multi-resistance,    similar resistance pattern may be found in the patient's intestinal flora (Aserkoff     &  Bennett 1969).  The genic transfer phenomenon observed in the    samples which are the object of our study emphasizes the relevance of those    factors in propagating resistant bacteria in different ecological niches, besides    the progressive limitations in the therapeutics using antimicrobials mostly    when the level of resistance to isolates is unknown.
