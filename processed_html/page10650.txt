Take it from a gentleman and follow the rules of good discourse: Your ban ends at  I ' m not a math expert or anything but Twisted Fate ' s stun CD = 3 seconds stun duration = 2 seconds so when you are 1v1ing TF, you get to play the game for 1 second every 2 seconds. TF essentially deleting 50% of your game by simply existing. so you ' re 50% useless, which basically means that TF makes the game a 4.5 vs 5 if that ' s not broken then what is ? We ' re testing a new feature that gives the option to view discussion comments in chronological order. Some testers have pointed out situations in which they feel a linear view could be helpful, so we ' d like see how you guys make use of it. TF is squishy af. I never quite liked TF ' s point and click frequent stun. But he ' d be quite trash without it. lol math aside, the starting point is already borked. The Pick A Card ' s CD is 6 seconds, not 3. It only stuns at the highest spell level, it starts with 1 second. There ' s also the  " luck draw "  aspect due to card rotation, making speed drawing in emergencies and quick ganks and stuff like that harder to pull off (excuse the pun). You also discounted all of the other factors like champ tankiness/squishiness, mana cost, the need to use other cards (red and blue), you can see the cards on TF ' s hand, etc too. lol math aside, the starting point is already borked.The Pick A Card ' s CD is 6 seconds, not 3.It only stuns at the highest spell level, it starts with 1 second.There ' s also the  " luck draw "  aspect due to card rotation, making speed drawing in emergencies and quick ganks and stuff like that harder to pull off (excuse the pun).You also discounted all of the other factors like champ tankiness/squishiness, mana cost, the need to use other cards (red and blue), you can see the cards on TF ' s hand, etc too.

Even if they literally come in with a full CDR setup in Runes or whatever, it still isn ' t that bad. Because TF has mana issues early game, and going full CDR early also means a lack of damage and having potentially wasted stats as they build items. lol math aside, the starting point is already borked.The Pick A Card ' s CD is 6 seconds, not 3.It only stuns at the highest spell level, it starts with 1 second.There ' s also the  " luck draw "  aspect due to card rotation, making speed drawing in emergencies and quick ganks and stuff like that harder to pull off (excuse the pun).You also discounted all of the other factors like champ tankiness/squishiness, mana cost, the need to use other cards (red and blue), you can see the cards on TF ' s hand, etc too.

I doubt 3 though, unless the fight is a long skirmish or something, but then the situation is different there. There ' s also the fact that its actually 3.6s cd at 40% cdr which means its about double the stun duration at the highest possible reduction, so your values are kinda a lie And the fact its a single target stun and there ' s 5 players that can jump your immobile ass in a fight if the stun isn ' t used just right And the fact that tons of abilities that can nuke or cc him outrange 525 (675 for one stun if you get rapidfire cannon reducing his AP) so you can just kill his squishy ass if he doesn ' t burn flash UNIVERSAL RULES 📜 Boards User Guide Boards Discord 💬 Official NA Discord 💬 Discuss the Boards Red Tracker   Dev Corner The Game Gameplay RANT Player Behavior Story, Art,  &  Sound Recruitment Clash Teamfight Tactics Gameplay Report a Bug Creative Corner Concepts  &  Creations Streams  &  Videos Community General Discussion Memes  &  Games Esports Roleplay Event Finder Mechs vs Minions Support Ask the Community Report A Bug Client Discussion Service Status Culture This is the place to talk about any and all things in the gamer cultural space (video games, anime, etc).
