advertisement the quebec government is considering legislation to order the lawyers back to work saying it ca n't afford to meet their demands the prosecutors and other lawyers say that the government 's plan all along has been to bring in back-to-work legislation what we are witnessing here is a play where the government has pretended to negotiate throughout the fall and literally forced us into a strike position in order to have a excuse to legislate us back to work said christian leblanc president of the quebec crown prosecutors association salaries and workload are at the heart of the dispute quebec prosecutors have argued for years that they are underpaid and overworked compared with prosecutors across the rest of canada this is an historic day this an opportunity for this government to fix an administration of justice that is broken said james chaffee president of the canadian association of crown counsel the quebec justice system he said has been chronically underfunded for years quebec is particularly untenable this is maybe the worst place for a prosecutor to work in canada it 's the worst pay with the highest workload and the poorest working conditions mr. chaffee said the lawyers are demanding parity with lawyers in the rest of canada they 've asked the government to set up a mechanism headed by an independent arbitrator to eliminate the 40-per-cent gap in pay that separates quebec prosecutors and government lawyers from what those in the rest of the country are paid story continues below advertisement forty per cent is a very conservative estimate our figures show that it is even higher than 40 per cent said marc lajoie president of the quebec civil lawyers and notaries association according to quebec government statistics the starting salary for a crown prosecutor in quebec is 42,000 compared with the national average of 58,000 the maximum salary in quebec is slightly more than 100,000 after 15 years of service compared with the national average of 140,000 the gap is even bigger when compared with ontario where salaries range from approximately 76,000 to 215,000 justice minister jean-marc fournier acknowledged there is a problem with the way lawyers have been treated but insisted that the government does not have the money to fill the salary gap with the rest of the country the government urged the prosecutors and other lawyers to return to the bargaining table but hinted that the province 's courts can not remain paralyzed for any great length of time there is disruption in our system of justice with this strike mr. fournier said i do n't want to light any fire we are n't trying to settle 30 years of disparity in one moment but we are doing everything we can with the means we got there was no indication from either side when or if bargaining will resume story continues below advertisement welcome to the globe and mail s comment community this is a space where subscribers can
