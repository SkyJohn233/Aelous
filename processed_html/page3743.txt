We aim to publish our Coupe de France tips on  Monday at 15:00 London time  as regardless if French Cup fixtures are scheduled to take place in midweek or weekend.

Established back in 1917,  Coupe de France  is the most prestigious cup competition in France. The French Cup is a knockout tournament with a total of 14 rounds, with pairings for each round being drawn at random. Teams face each other in single-leg ties, and, if the match ends in a draw, the winner is decided in extra-time or after penalties. The title game is hosted by  Stade de France , the venue which can hold up to 80,698 people. The winner of the French Cup is guaranteed a place in the  UEFA Europa League . If the winner has already booked their spot in the  Champions League  through the national championship, the UEFA Europa League spot goes to the next highest-placed finisher in the standings. Paris Saint-Germain are  the most successful club  in the history of the competition, with the capital club clinching their 12th trophy in the 2017/2018 season and usually featured in our  bet of the day . RC Lens holds the record for the biggest win in the history of the Coupe de France as they outclassed Auby-Asturies 32-0 in the last 32 of the competition in 1942. A clash between  Stade Rennes  and Avant de Guingamp from 2009 is considered the Coupe de France final with the most spectators ( 80,056 ). Similar to cup competitions from other popular football leagues, underdogs often go far in the Coupe de France. Therefore, our advice is to avoid betting on favourites,  except for PSG , when it comes to the French Cup games. As always, teams who struggle in the Ligue 1 aim to regain much-needed confidence by recording good results in the Coupe de France. Over the years,  PSG  have established themselves as the dominant team in French football. Les Parisiens want to win everything each season, and they are always considered  No. 1 favourites to win both league and competitions . However, bear in mind that reputable bookmakers usually offer low odds on the star-studded French giants. PSG coaches often rest key players in Coupe de France games, but it is well known that they have strength in depth. Since  Ligue 1  clubs are visitors when draws against lower-league teams, underdogs often claim major scalps in the Coupe de France. Home field advantage is one of the most important factors when it comes to betting on the French Cup; therefore, make sure you  avoid putting your money on the away teams . Nonetheless, this suggestion does not apply to the aforementioned Paris Saint-Germain, who score goals for fun both at home and on the travels. Our Coupe de France tips are created by experienced and  reliable football writers, columnists, and betting tipsters .
