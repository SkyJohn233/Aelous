Contractors '  Questions: Which form to fill in so a US client can pay me? Contractor’s Question : I'm a UK contractor with his own England-registered limited company and I’ve provided a freelance service including some licences to a company located in the USA. I've been asked by this US-only client to fill in and return Form i-9, but I believe this form is not relevant to me. What form should a limited company (operating under my trading name) fill in when  contracting for a firm exclusively located in America ? Meanwhile, I’ve read that tax will be levied at a whopping 30%; surely this isn’t the case? Expert’s Answer : From the information provided, it seems that a US-based client issued a contract to your UK personal service company for a ‘freelance service’ which has been carried out. It seems that your company now needs to receive payment. You should therefore complete Form W-8BEN-E before that payment can be made to your UK limited company; but  you do not  send it to the IRS (US Internal Revenue Service). Instead, you must present the Form to the ‘tax withholding agent’ (i.e. your US-based client). This is because a ‘foreign entity’ (i.e. your UK personal service company) is receiving a payment which is subject to US withholding tax. The Form is submitted by the client to the IRS. The client should then check with the IRS whether the maximum 30% has to be withheld or whether applicable tax treaties (between the US and UK) and any special circumstances affecting the work assignment can effect a lower percentage. You may then be able to offset the US withholding tax against your UK corporate tax liability on your personal service company’s next corporate tax return. Good luck!
