Professional XML Buy this book This manuscript is an abridged version of a chapter from the Wrox Press book  Professional XML . Chapter 6 of Professional XML covers the Simple API for XML, or SAX, interface. It explains why might you use it instead of the DOM, and will get you writing simple applications with SAX, as well as explaining a little bit about where it came from, and where it's going.  Professional XML is a broad compendium that investigates and describes how the total XML concept will work for programmers. It's the next edition of the popular XML Applications (Wrox 1998). The focus of Professional XML is on real-world applications that use XML as an enabling technology. It presents good design techniques, and shows how to interface XML-enabled applications with Web applications and database systems. It explores the frontiers of XML and previews some nascent technologies. Whether your requirements are oriented toward data exchange or visual styling, this book will cover all the relevant techniques in the XML community. Professional XML is for anyone who wants to use XML to build applications and systems. Web site developers can learn techniques to take their sites to the next level of sophistication. Managers, designers, and software architects can learn where XML fits into their systems and how to use it to solve problems in application integration.
