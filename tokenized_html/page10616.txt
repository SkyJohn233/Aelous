this service viking and tallink silja i found that the pricing is similar and i would appreciate if someone could give your opinion on which of this cruise line is your preferred cruise line and why i also found that there are third party website like direct ferries that i can book cruise from and the price is exactly the same as booking from the cruise lines themselves would anyone know of any benefits to booking through such third party website as compared to booking with the cruise lines themselves can someone comment and compare cruising in the night instead of the day and vice versa for the helsinki stockholm route we have never been on a cruise before thanks is it true that that a return ta ta.queueforload ta.queueforload function f g document.addeventlistener 'domcontentloaded f

ticket helsinki stockholm helsinki and get off at stockholm and not use the return portion can anyone advice i can not see any benefits in booking through an intermediary if the price is the same in such a case you lose the direct contact with the ferry company if things go wrong cancellations etc have to be then done through the intermediary with their cancellation terms and conditions which may be more strict than those of the ferry company for differences between tallinksilja and viking line there are plenty of earlier threads on this forum just use the search function above or have a look

you don t have to spend money on a hotel if you want to explore stockholm more than one day you could check if the cruising company offers good deals on hotel rooms booked via their website there are at least two major harbours for passenger ships in helsinki and stockholm they all have relatively good public transport connections but you might want to check the harbour locations on a map and see which is more convenient for your planned activities in stockholm and your accomodation in helsinki in helsinki viking cruise ships depart from the katajanokka harbour search street address katajanokanlaituri 8 in google maps tallink silja ships depart from the olympic terminal the address is olympiaranta 1 these harbours in helsinki are accessible by tram and they are not too far from

helsinki stockholm overnight cruise in 1986 that was a little while ago and what i remember is a lot of drunk passengers i wouldn t mention it now except that as i am looking online for baltic cruises for my family i saw a post on this website from 2008 which also said that the overnight cruises attract partiers there s a lot less partying now between hel-sto as there s a specific party boat

'postlinks-64804818 'log_autolink_impression helsinki stockholm route we have never been on a cruise before there is no daytime ferry service between helsinki and stockholm both ferry companies run only overnight services however in late may the hours of daylight even in the south of finland are so long that the difference between night and day is not entirely clear you will get to see more than enough islands in clear daylight that s for sure this alone is something hugely exotic for visitors from tropical climes like yourself re the granny boat polarbearfin refers to many of my foreign visitors have enjoyed seeing the geriatric dancing on baltic ferries it s a cultural attraction an exotic folk custom for many nationalities as far as drunkenness goes you can always avoid most of it by going to bed early by the time you wake up the worst offenders will be locked up in the brig and you can enjoy the sunlit islands in peace i ve made hundreds of crossings on the baltic and i ve had only one encounter with a nasty drunk in the past 20 years by taking this precaution and even that occasion was only a small problem message from tripadvisor staff this topic has been closed to new
