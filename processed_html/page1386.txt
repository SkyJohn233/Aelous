The versatile Harrison ( Enchantments , 2012,etc.)—novelist, biographer, memoirist and true-crime writer—becomes the mostrecent in a long list of authors to tell the story of the unusual warrior. Born in 1412 and executed just 19 years later, Frenchpeasant Joan of Arc began listening to the voices of angels at age 14 (“hersalone, a rapturous secret”). She did not suspect at first, nor did anybodyelse, that those angels wanted her to undertake a seemingly impossible task: tolead an army of Frenchmen into battle against the mighty enemy forces fromacross the channel in England. The tale of Joan of Arc has been told countlesstimes, so why revisit it, especially when hard evidence is lacking? Forstarters, Harrison's editor suggested the topic. At that point, the authordecided 21st century readers required a new narrative of a life so improbableand heroic. Harrison knew, of course, about the daunting list of previousinterpreters, including William Shakespeare, George Bernard Shaw, BertoltBrecht and Mark Twain. She wisely examines some of those previousinterpretations, finding some of the speculation and historicism plausible butsome of it wanting. Harrison examines Joan as a sexual being as well as awarrior and perhaps a schizophrenic. The sexuality angle becomes especiallyprovocative when Harrison discusses how God may have favored Joan due to thevirginity she advertised so boldly. The author recounts the battle scenes insometimes-excruciating detail and gives plenty of space to her arrest, trialand execution. She also provides a chronology. The vivid stories of Joan’sremarkable life never died completely, leading to her canonization as a saintin 1920. Harrison joins the psychobiography school of life writing,doing so with memorable writing and an energetic approach. © Copyright 2019 Kirkus Media LLC. All Rights Reserved.
