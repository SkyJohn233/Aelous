This will be the second time for the event to be held in Thousand Oaks. About 1,000 people attended the first expo in 2014, and organizers hope to top that number, according to Elaine Lo, chair of the Chinese Cultural Expo committee. The Conejo Chinese Cultural Association and the Thousand Oaks Chinese School are putting on the event, which will also include origami — the art of paper-folding — and Chinese painting, featuring artist Stella Chi. On Oct. 29 at Thousand Oaks High School, where more than 600 students attend Chinese School, youngsters rehearsed for the dragon and lion dance parade. Eric Kong, the school's kung fu coach, played the Chinese dragon drum as 10-year-old Bryan Huang carried the dragon ball and led the dragon, which was held up by six students.

The dragon ball symbolizes a pearl. “The dragon always tries to grab the pearl, which is a symbol of purity, luck and good fortune,” Kong said. Six other students rehearsed the intricately choreographed lion dance. Lukas Rios, 12, said it took about a week to learn the steps. “It’s almost like being a lion,” he said. “It’s pretty cool."

(Photo: KAREN QUINCY LOBERG/THE STAR) Kong said anyone who knows kung fu basics can do the dragon and lion dance. Some of the dancers were as young as 5. “With kung fu, there is no age limit,” Kong said. “You can have people starting at 2 years old. And in this class, we have a lot of parents involved, too.” Some of the students practiced the weaponry they will demonstrate at the expo. Nikki St. Charles, 12, worked with the northern-style Chinese broadsword, which requires both kung fu and performance skills. “In broadsword, you have to do a lot of twirling, and you have to twist your wrists and make sure the edge doesn’t cut you,” Nikki said. “And when you do the spinning, you have to make sure it doesn’t hit your leg.” Eddy Hsu, left, works the head of the dragon as Si Fu Eric Kong, right, directs the Oct. 29 rehearsal for Saturday ' s Chinese Cultural Expo.

Her mother, Barbara St. Charles, is Native American, and said she learned while going to school in Japan, “If you want to conquer someone, you take their language. They can’t be proud of who they are if they don’t have their culture and their language.” Nikki, she said, is proud of being both American and Chinese. Lo said she hopes the event will be embraced by both communities. “Many people are interested in the Chinese culture,” Lo said. “And we have a large Chinese community.” The event will also feature crafts and children’s games, including a Chinese style of pingpong and a version of Wheel of Fortune that incorporates the 12 Chinese Zodiac signs. A fashion show of formal Chinese attire is scheduled, and there will be a booth where guests can dress in the styles from early dynasties and take pictures. Two Chinese food trucks will be present, Lo said, one with more modern dim sum and the other with more traditional dishes. “We have a rich heritage that we like to show people, and we want to share that,” Lo said.
