Share a link A proof is given for the triangle inequality of distance function  d  in the reduced nuclear configuration space  M , used in the differentiable manifold model of potential‚Äêenergy hypersurfaces [P. G. Mezey, Int. J. Quantum Chem. Quantum Chem. Symp.  17 , 137 (1983)]. This result completes the proof that  M  is indeed a metric space with metric  d .
