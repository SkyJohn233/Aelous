Swearinger , Cravens abruptly  made the decision to retire  just before the season. Then, he changed his mind almost immediately and considered returning to the team. Ultimately, the team decide to place Cravens on the exempt/left squad list to give him time to figure things out. However, when Cravens decided he wanted to return, the Redskins elected to place him on the reserve/left squad list meaning that  he would officially be out for the 2017 season . The Redskins likely didn’t want to rely on him without a guarantee that he would be ready to give the team 100 percent week in and week out. In his stead, the Redskins have gotten strong play out of fourth round rookie  Montae Nicholson  while  Deshazor Everett  has looked good in run support. Still, the team needs some more depth at the position and a potential ballhawk, especially if Cravens elects not to return in 2018.  Jamar Summers  could be that guy. Summers is currently a senior at UConn, but he had a very memorable year for the team during his sophomore season. That year, Summers totaled a whopping eight interceptions and he was excellent in coverage for the team. He still is a playmaker and he was able to break up a career high nine passes last year. His solid play has continued this year and he has the potential to be a strong player in the NFL. However, Summers does have some weaknesses. Notably, his lack of athletic ability could cause him some troubles at the NFL level. Also, as  Erik Lambert of NFL Mocks  says, Summers could be susceptible to being beat because of his tendency to watch the quarterback. Roger Staubach used to call guys like Summers a “looker.” In other words a cornerback who likes watching the quarterback to see where the ball is going. Such types can be susceptible to fakes and double moves. Or they just lose track of their receivers, opening up huge plays down the field. Still, Summers is worth the pick at this juncture. The team could allow him time to develop as the fifth safety or they could try and stash him on the practice squad. Either way, he would fit well with the team.

Here\u2019s a look at a very early 7-round mock for their team. < \/h2>\n The 2017 NFL Draft was a great moment for the Redskins organization. Armed with 10 picks, the team did well to find a great deal of quality playmakers on the defensive side of the ball. It appears that they have found a solid starter in  Jonathan Allen < \/a>, a special teams ace with upside in  Fabian Moreau < \/a>, and on offense, they found a running back who could earn a role with the team in  Samaje Perine < \/a>. The team should be praised for their efforts to find the best available players. < \/p>\n Repeating that success in 2018 will be no easy task. The Redskins were lucky to have Allen, a top five talent, slip to them at pick No. 17. They will not be so lucky again, so they have to make sure that they scout well in the lead up to the draft. < \/p>\n The draft is a long ways away, but the college football season is now in full swing in mid-October. Many players are emerging as candidates for early round picks while some that were previously favored as top picks are slipping. Right now, draft stock is extremely volatile, as is expected for the middle of the season. < \/p>\n Still, the Redskins are scouting all the players hard and they are definitely looking for key playmakers who will help them replace some of the guys they will lose during 2018 free agency. So we decided to do a Redskins centered mock draft using the  On The Clock simulator from FanSpeak.com < \/a>. Without further ado, here\u2019s a look at the team\u2019s 7-round mock draft, the mid-October edition. < \/p>\n \n     \n         Next:  < \/span>\n        Round 1, Pick 19\n     < \/a>\n < \/div>
