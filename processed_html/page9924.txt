I &# x27;m trying to learn how to play Ragtime piano, does anyone have any advice on exercises or where to start? : piano So far I &# x27;ve found these: http://www.ragtimepiano.ca/rags/review5.htm http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6qPyhTaiK8 http://www.pianotricks.com/lesson.php?input=32 I really need any advice or tips on how build independence between the left hand and right hand. Coming from playing Blues, Jazz, Funk and Rock styles to Ragtime is pretty difficult for me, especially with the gigantic leaps the left hand has to account for. It probably doesn &# x27;t help that I &# x27;m self taught, have no formal training and can &# x27;t easily read music (it takes me a long time to read and understand sheet music, but I &# x27;m slowly improving). As you can imagine, finding a ragtime piano teacher/mentor is not easy, especially considering I can &# x27;t really afford lessons. Any advice, hints, exercises, or help would be greatly appreciated. UPDATE: After following everyone advice and dedicating 2-4 hours in the last two days to learning it. I can slowly play the first page of Maple Leaf Rag, the sheet I &# x27;m learning from is here: http://www.mutopiaproject.org/ftp/JoplinS/maple/maple-a4.pdf Thanks to everyone for your advice and encouragement! Without your help I probably would have given up declaring Ragtime Piano as something I can &# x27;t and will never be able to play, now that I &# x27;m starting to  " get it "  I &# x27;m having a blast and looking forward to learning more. Buy some scott joplin scores. And not the watered down ones. From there I &# x27;d try to start learning some jazz standards and make your own arrangements for them in the ragtime style. Edit- also try listening to art tatum. And eventually transcribe one of his arrangements also try listening to art tatum. And eventually transcribe one of his arrangements. I &# x27;ve learned about half a dozen Tatum transcriptions (all on youtube) and I &# x27;ve done some transcription work myself, and yet I can &# x27;t even  imagine  being able to successfully transcribe a single piece of his. Maybe in a few decades, anyway. Your suggestion about arranging jazz standards in a ragtime style is excellent though...you can do the same for rock, pop and even video game music and it usually sounds great. However I just wanted to mention that I think transcribing Tatum is setting the bar a  bit  high. This is great! I have sheet music for Maple Leaf Rag (which I &# x27;m having a lot of trouble getting the syncopation right), but turning some Jazz Standards into my own ragtime arrangements is a fantastic idea! Thank you for this! First off. Get a recording of the piece your going to learn. I recommend the maple leaf rag or the entertainer both for classic rag feel and popularity making it easy to find online. Learn the hands separately for your first piece. Ragtime generally breaks down well into sections so do the first part separate and then integrate the hands. Learn the next part separate and integrate.. Rinse repeat. Play them slow and with a metronome. Coming from jazz you may feel like there &# x27;s room to fudge the timing or be loose with the rhythm. You &# x27;re wrong to think this. Rag is to be played exactly how written and should not be played faster than the specified tempo. Good luck, rag is so much fun once you get it! Thank you for this, I &# x27;m powering through that feeling of getting nowhere, after 3 solid hours I can finally play the first bar of Maple Leaf Rag at a very very very slow tempo (it doesn &# x27;t even sound like Maple Leaf Rag at this slow tempo). However as they say Rome wasn &# x27;t built in a day, practice makes perfect. You &# x27;re correct on the Jazz part impeding on my progress, I &# x27;m so used to comping with my left hand and the flexibility of Jazz, the steadiness of the left hand on Rag is very very difficult to get a grasp of, but I &# x27;m determined to figure this out, building muscle memory will help after a few days of practice. I can &# x27;t wait to  " get it "  it looks like so much fun! You could also check out Scott Bradlee &# x27;s book  &# x27;Ragtimify &# x27;  https://gumroad.com/l/PSDh I found that with ragtime, once you crack your first tune, the rest follow the same pattern and technique to such an extent that the time to learn each subsequent tune is diminished. As a kid with only modest piano skills at around 15y.o, the movie  " The Sting "  had just been released and many of Scott Joplin &# x27;s popular ragtime pieces were firmly in my head, making the learning process easier owing to the familiarity of the melody. I &# x27;d suggest that you watch (or re-watch The Sting), then choose one of Scott Joplin &# x27;s rags that you like and enjoy. Something like, The Easy Winners or The Entertainer are probably the easiest to get the hang of. Despite Maple Leaf Rag looking and sounding difficult, if you take it slow, practice you left hand by itself until you get the hang of  " stride " &# x27; then put it together bar-by-bar to develop your muscle memory, it isn &# x27;t really as difficult as it looks because it follows such a repetitive pattern. It was only the second ragtime piece I learnt after the Entertainer so it couldn &# x27;t be too hard! 137k Pianists 448 NOT currently practicing Oct 28, 2008 Cake Day
