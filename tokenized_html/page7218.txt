share a link ruddlesden–popper reduced‐dimensional hybrid perovskite rdp semiconductors have attracted significant attention recently due to their promising stability and excellent optoelectronic properties here the rdp crystallization mechanism in real time from liquid precursors to the solid film is investigated and how the phase transition kinetics influences phase purity quantum well orientation and photovoltaic performance is revealed an important template‐induced nucleation and growth of the desired ba 2 ma 3 pb 4 i 13 phase which is achieved only via direct crystallization without formation of intermediate phases is observed as such the thermodynamically preferred perpendicular crystal orientation and high phase purity are obtained at low temperature the formation of intermediate phases including pbi 2 crystals and solvate complexes slows down intercalation of ions and increases nucleation barrier leading to formation of multiple rdp phases and orientation randomness these insights enable to obtain high quality ba 2 ma 3 pb 4 i 13 films with preferentially perpendicular quantum well orientation high phase purity smooth film surface and improved optoelectronic properties the resulting devices exhibit high power conversion efficiency of 12.17 this work should help guide the perovskite community to better control ruddlesden–popper perovskite structure and further improve optoelectronic and solar cell devices organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite materials have been extensively investigated owing to their remarkable photophysical properties such as strong broadband light absorption 1 3 an extremely low density of harmful defects 4 5 and excellent carrier diffusion length 6 as perovskite film fabrication and device structure design have progressed the power conversion efficiency pce of solar cells based on lead perovskites has experienced unprecedented rises from 3.8 to the current certified record of 22.7 7 the combination of facile fabrication wide tunability though precursor chemistry and excellent optoelectronic properties has inspired the design of broad applications for perovskites beyond the photovoltaics area such as in water splitting 8 sensor 9 11 and lasing applications 12 13 in spite of the many new advances the main focus of past investigations on perovskites with some exceptions has been aimed at bulk 3d lead‐based perovskites however a particular class of hybrid perovskites ruddlesden–popper phase reduced‐dimensional 2d and quasi‐2d metal‐halide perovskites rdps a n a′ n −1 m n x 3 n +1 where a and a′ are cations m is metal and x is halide are becoming a new target of perovskite‐based research 14 19 these materials unlike graphene or other conventional 2d systems 20 22 can be grown from solution which then allows for a remarkable tunability of the structure and properties of the materials through the appropriate use of functional organic molecules and relaxed size restrictions 18 such that they provide not only high performance optoelectronic properties in contrast to 3d perovskites 19 23 24 but also high stability to light irradiation and chemical erosion recent work demonstrates that for rdps there exists an intrinsic mechanism for dissociation of the excitons to long‐lived free carriers provided by layer‐edge states less when n is larger than 2 25 this means fabricating solar cells from polycrystalline films with high purity and proper crystal grain sizes to allow balanced exciton diffusion to less and charge transport is one of the key factors to guarantee that charges can be separated and collected efficiently in a recent breakthrough perpendicular out‐of‐plane growth of perovskite crystals between electrodes was established by several groups as a key enabler for efficient out‐of‐plane charge carrier transport in the 2d perovskites 26 interestingly the crystal growth is found to be highly dependent upon the solution‐processing conditions for example casting ba 2 ma 3 pb 4 i 13 solution on the hot substrate facilitates a strongly out‐of‐plane texture of the crystallographic planes of the inorganic perovskite component while casting on substrates maintained at room temperature does not 24 in addition to substrate temperature the choice of solvent also plays an important role in determining texture the ba 2 ma 2 sn 3 i 11 slabs show an in‐plane alignment of the crystallographic planes with the substrate when dimethyl sulfoxide dmso is used as the solvent but this orientation can be flipped to the perpendicular direction when n n ‐dimethylformamide dmf is used instead 27 these findings in the literature point to a complex formation mechanism of rdps which remains to be further clarified and understood in order to achieve the desired texture and physical properties herein through extensive in situ investigations modeling film and device characterizations we elucidate the rdp crystallization mechanism during solution processing and identify the key bottlenecks that limit the rdp film properties and overall efficiency of solar cells we demonstrate that highly crystalline rdps with high phase purity preferentially perpendicular crystal orientation and large grain size can be grown only by fast and direct transition from a disordered precursor solvate to the perovskite phase without formation of any intermediate phases by contrast the indirect crystallization does not template rdp phases for nucleation and growth leading to orientation randomness and phase impurity we demonstrate this to result in high pce of 12.17 whereas the indirect crystallization through the solvate phase leads to pce in the range of 3–8.5 the phase transition from precursor sol–gel to the perovskite phase that occurs during the solution casting was probed in situ using time‐resolved grazing incidence wide‐angle x‐ray scattering giwaxs which provides a comprehensive picture of how solution‐processing conditions modulate the kinetics and mechanism of the rdp crystallization the influences of the phase transition on the morphology and optoelectronic properties are also investigated thoroughly to establish a process–structure–property–performance relationship for this exciting new class of perovskite semiconductors thin films of the rdp ba 2 ma n −1 pb n i 3 n +1 n 4 n is set by the ratio of precursors used for a given solution were fabricated using a one‐step spin‐coating method reported previously 28 we set out to investigate the role of ink formulation and coating temperature on the formation morphology phase purity texture quantum well orientation optoelectronic properties and solar cell performance of films since both these parameters are known to impact the solidification outcome of layered perovskites the ink formulation was varied in terms of the choice and ratio of solvent mixtures namely dmf and dmso coating temperature was controlled by preheating the substrate and sample holder prior to spin coating the solution was spin cast on a compact tio 2 c‐tio 2 ‐coated fluorine‐doped tin oxide fto glass substrate followed immediately by thermal annealing at 100 °c for 10 min figure 1 a we begin by evaluating the photovoltaic performance of rdp films fabricated in the different conditions as outlined above the solar cells were fabricated according to the glass/fto/c‐tio 2 /rdps/2,2′,7,7′‐tetrakis n n‐d 4‐methoxyphenyl amino ‐9,9′‐spiro‐bifluorene spiro‐ometad /au architecture figure 1 a the most common fabrication condition for rdp films consists of spin coating from a dmf solution on the room temperature substrate abbreviated as dmf‐25 °c 17 29 32 this yields poor device performance which is consistent with previous reports 29 30 we recorded an average pce of 3.09 and peak efficiency of 3.25 with v oc of 1.02 v j sc of 9.25 ma cm −2 and fill factor ff 32.75 figure 1 b we then introduced dmso into the dmf solution but maintained the substrate temperature at 25 °c with the aim of modifying the precursor phase through the formation of dmso–pbi 2 intermediate phases which are known to assist the fabrication of 3d perovskite films 33 35 we found a solvent mixture with dmso dmf 7:3 ratio abbreviated as dmso dmf‐25 °c yields a significantly improved pce with average 7.25 and peak efficiency of 8.54 the enhancement of pce is mainly ascribed to the large improvements of j sc and ff in contrast to the neat dmf sample i.e. 14.02 versus 9.25 ma cm −2 and 53.04 versus 35.75 respectively this improvement hints at significant differences in the film microstructure which we will investigate below encouraged by this we increased the substrate temperature stepwise up to 150 °c by preheating prior to spin casting the solution we found that device performance increases monotonically with temperature up to 90 °c abbreviated as dmso dmf‐90 °c achieving a peak efficiency of 12.17 with v oc of 1.08 v j sc of 19.45 ma cm −2 and ff 58.22 figure 1 b and table 1 the measured external quantum efficiency eqe and the corresponding integrated j sc are plotted in figure 1 c. the integrated j sc is calculated to be 19.20 ma cm −2 which is within 1.5 of the j sc measured under am 1.5g standard irradiation furthermore both forward and reverse scans yield a negligible variation in j – v characteristics indicating low hysteresis 36 37 further increasing the substrate temperature deteriorates all figures of merit with pce declining significantly to 0.63 at 150 °c table s1 supporting information the device performance was further investigated by casting solution on the 90 °c substrate with different volume ratios of dmso dmf confirming the optimum solvent mixture to be dmso dmf 7:3 table s1 supporting information for the rdp solar cells the device results show that they are dependent upon choice of solvent and substrate temperature indicating that formation of the rdp films is significantly influenced we investigated the film formation mechanism and its dependence on the above important parameters by performing time‐resolved giwaxs in situ during spin coating 38 39 three distinct conditions examined include dmf‐25 °c dmso dmf‐25 °c and dmso dmf‐90 °c the time evolutions of the diffraction features as a function of scattering vector q and time are illustrated in figure 2 for the three cases representative 2d giwaxs snapshots taken at the end of spin coating are shown in figure s1a–c supporting information the integrated intensity traces during spin coating associated to reflection of the rdp phase q 10.0 nm −1 are plotted in figure s1d supporting information intensity versus q for the scattering features of the three as‐cast films are plotted in figure s1e supporting information and the pole figures showing the differences in broadness of the azimuth angle are plotted in figure s1f supporting information in all the cases we observed a scattering halo at low q values 2.5–5.5 nm −1 corresponding to disordered precursor colloidal sol–gel figure 2 similar to previous observations in 3d mapbx 3 solutions 40 41 the scattering halo at low q dynamically evolves toward larger q values as the solvent evaporates in the dmf‐25 °c case figure 2 a d the rdp phase q 10 nm −1 forms upon solidification at 20 s. previous investigations of solution casting mai pbcl 2 or mai pbi 2 from dmf have revealed the formation of mai·pbi 2 ·dmf crystalline solvate 40 42 crystalline solvates are also observed for the dmf‐25 °c formulation with relatively weaker scattering features located at q 3.9 and 7.7 nm −1 corresponding to the ch 3 ch 2 ch 2 ch 2 nh 3 i bai ch 3 nh 3 i mai pbi 2 ·dmf and pbi 2 ·dmf 40 41 respectively the scattering intensity of the rdp phase increases continuously for a duration of 10 s from 20–30 s figure s1d supporting information implying continuing nucleation and growth during the same time period the broad diffraction peak suggests small rdp crystals with wide distribution in size the representative 2d giwaxs snapshot taken at the end of spin coating exhibits orientation randomness for both the rdp phase and intermediate solvates figure s1 supporting information it is important to note that the formation of intermediate phase slows down intercalation of ions and significantly influences crystallization of the quantum wells when the solvent evaporates out the complexes become weakened allowing organic cation ba and ma intercalation with newly released pbi 2 or bai mai pbi 2 ·dmf framework to form rdps noteworthy smaller‐ n phases n 4 are more favorable during crystallization due to lower nucleation barrier 43 thus the final film would contain rdp quantum wells with various n values indeed phase heterogeneity is observed by the end of thermal annealing as will be shown further the rdp formation can therefore be described by the following chemical equations it takes more than 80 s for the dmso dmf‐25 °c system to solidify figure 2 b e and figure s1d supporting information much longer than the dmf system thanks in part to the higher boiling point of dmso compared to dmf 189 vs 152 °c respectively however the dmso dmf‐25 °c formulation does not yield the desired perovskite phase during solution casting instead randomly oriented intermediate phases are formed including pbi 2 crystals q 8.9 nm −1 40 pbi 2 ·dmso solvate q 7.9 nm −1 and bai mai pbi 2 ·dmso solvate q 3.7 4.3 4.8 6.3 nm −1 the precursor·dmso solvate is also observed in another separated work when solution casting mapbi 3 from dmso gamma‐butyrolactone gbl solvent mixture or neat dmso 44 the scattering intensity of these solvate phases is much stronger in contrast to that for the dmf‐25 °c case figure s1e supporting information a plausible explanation is that dmso can form strong lewis‐base adducts with lead halide 45 and strong hydrogen bonds with ammonium salts due to high polarity 7.2 43 in this scenario the presence of large amount of dmso further increases the nucleation barrier of the desired rdp phase 43 therefore n 4 phases are remarkably favored when intermediate phases transfer to rdps due to the bai overconsumption for n 4 rdps the leftover precursors could subsequently assemble to n 4 rdps or even 3d perovskite leading to broader phase distribution in contrast to the dmf‐25 °c case the rdp formation can be thus described in the following chemical equations in contrast to these 25 °c cases the dmso dmf‐90 °c formulation exhibits direct phase transition from precursor sol–gel to the rdp phase without appearance of any intermediate phases on the rapid time‐scale of in situ measurements figure 2 c f the solution quickly solidifies at ≈2 s due to fast evaporation of solvents figure s1d supporting information the perovskite phase forming at ≈2 s continues to dynamically evolve over a period longer than 2 min figure s1d supporting information the quick and direct phase transition from precursor sol–gel to the rdp phase is ascribed to the fast nucleation of precursors on the preheated substrate 46 48 once formed these nuclei act as templates with further growth continuing outward quite rapidly 49 this template‐aided growth yields highly crystalline rdp phase during solution processing as evidenced by the observations of a quite narrow scattering peak figure s1e supporting information indicating highly oriented quantum wells figure s1f supporting information another interesting feature appears to be that in the absence of dmso solution‐casting films from pure dmf on the preheated substrate leads to a lower quality rdp phase suggesting that dmso participates more actively even at high temperature in perovskite crystallization see figure s2 in the supporting information for more details the direct phase transition can be described as we sought to ascertain how the phase transition influences the state of films the crystalline quality of the final films after thermal annealing was first investigated using ex situ giwaxs diagnostics the giwaxs patterns for the three cases are shown in figure 3 a–c and the corresponding intensity versus q for the diffraction features is plotted in figure 3 d. after thermal annealing all intermediate phases are replaced by perovskite phase note that solvate phases have the opportunity to realign amid the solvent and dissolved ions especially for the dmso dmf‐25 °c case this is evidenced by the fact that the bai mai pbi 2 ·dmso solvate is predominantly oriented randomly in the as‐cast film while the quantum well orientation in the final films is significantly improved figure 3 b and figure s1b supporting information due to different competing phase transition mechanisms the final films exhibit significant phase impurity accordingly we confirm the ba 2 ma 3 pb 4 i 13 formation in all films based on crystallographic determinations from indexing the bragg peaks observed from giwaxs and high‐resolution x‐ray diffraction xrd data figure s3a–c supporting information the strong scattering peak at q 10.0 nm −1 corresponds to their 111 plane of orthorhombic structure it is evident that the dmso dmf‐25 °c film appears to be a mixture of multiple rdp phases with different n values both giwaxs figure 3 b d and high‐resolution xrd patterns figure s3 supporting information indicate existence of n ≤ 4 phases including the 020 plane of the ba 2 ma n −1 pb n i 3 n +1 n 3 ba 2 ma 2 pb 3 i 10 phase the 020 plane of the ba 2 ma n −1 pb n i 3 n +1 n 2 ba 2 ma pb 2 i 7 phase the 002 plane of the ba 2 ma n −1 pb n i 3 n +1 n 1 ba 2 pbi 4 phase the 040 plane of the ba 2 ma n −1 pb n i 3 n +1 n 2 ba 2 ma pb 2 i 7 phase and the 111 plane of the n 4 phase larger‐ n phases or even 3d perovskites coexist with the n 4 phase with the scattering arcs also located at q 10.0 nm −1 in contrast smaller‐ n phases are less prominent for the dmf‐25 °c film from giwaxs and xrd patterns indicating reduced phase heterogeneity importantly there is lack of strong feature for n 4 phases in the dmso dmf‐90 °c film implying high phase purity figure 3 c and figure s3 supporting information however this does not mean phase impurity does not absolutely exist merely that multiple phases are not discernible by x‐ray scattering the comparison of intensity versus q for the perovskite diffraction features indicates significantly improved crystalline quality of rdps in the presence of dmso figure 3 e the crystal sizes calculated using scherrer formula for the predominant 111 peak yield ≈33.5 nm ≈62.4 nm and ≈71.1 nm for the dmf‐25 °c dmso dmf‐25 °c and dmso dmf‐90 °c cases respectively this suggests the growth of larger crystals in the dmso‐derived films since the rdp crystallization is highly sensitive to nucleation barrier and ion diffusion the lower nucleation density and faster ion diffusion are inferred from the larger crystal size when higher affinity dmso is introduced the influence of phase transition on quantum well orientation was further investigated the pole figures of the azimuth angle shows three arcs along the same rings at 90° 137° and 160° figure 3 f for the dmf‐25 °c case indicating that quantum wells are randomly oriented in films for the dmso dmf‐25 °c case the pole figures shows two arcs at the azimuth angle of 90° and 170° also suggesting orientation distribution but reduced randomness by contrast the dmso dmf‐90 °c film exhibits sharp discrete bragg spots at pole figure 90° without noticeable peaks along the same rings indicating that the quantum wells are highly oriented with inorganic layers perpendicular to the substrate to form continuous charge‐transport channels allowing efficient charge transport in the vertical direction this is likely one of origins that the device fabricated via direct crystallization shows much improved j sc as observed in figure 1 and in previous work 24 computational analysis was further performed on the interface between rdp nuclei and tio 2 substrate based on density functional theory figure 3 g to this end orthorhombic ba 2 ma 3 pb 4 i 13 slab was deposited onto tio 2 slab under two forms ba attached tio 2 and ma attached tio 2 representing the parallel orientation and perpendicular orientation conditions respectively these nuclei were placed in contact with 120 tio 2 anatase 5 × 3 × 2 slab with a mostly exposed 101 surface the optimized tio 2 cell parameters are used throughout our calculations and this supercell guarantees the distance between adjacent ba 2 ma 3 pb 4 i 13 nuclei larger than 15 å to ignore the coupling effect the interfacial energy is evaluated as follows after geometry optimization the ba 2 ma 3 pb 4 i 13 /tio 2 junction with parallel orientation exhibits a 0.5 ev interfacial energy which mainly comes from van der waals force in the perpendicular orientation case bond formation between iodine and under coordinated titanium is highly favored which leads to a strong interfacial energy of 8.9 ev this value is almost 18‐fold higher in contrast to the parallel orientation case one can therefore deduce from these theoretical results that the perpendicular orientation is highly preferred thermodynamically when the ba 2 ma 3 pb 4 i 13 nuclei form on tio 2 substrate also see figure s4 in the supporting information for interfacial energies for rdp/tio 2 with n 2 and 1 the film morphology was examined using scanning electronic microscopy sem and atomic force microscopy afm cross‐sectional sem image of the dmf‐25 °c sample exhibits a concrete film with densely packed grains figure 4 a perpendicular growth of rdp planes is observed for the dmso dmf cases plan‐view sem and afm provide more insights into surface quality uniform surface without large grain boundaries can be observed from sem images for the three cases figure 4 b however a closer view from afm images suggests quite distinct surfaces figure 4 c the dmf‐25 °c film is extremely rough root‐mean‐square roughness rms 42.8 nm with in‐plane feature size of only 200–500 nm figure s5 supporting information in contrast in‐plane features are quite large 2–5 µm for the dmso dmf‐25 °c and ‐90 °c cases with relatively higher smoothness for the latter 21.6 vs 16.2 nm respectively these results imply that film quality is much better when precursors directly crystallize to rdps without formation of intermediate phases the difference of perovskite crystalline quality and morphology prompted further study into optoelectronic properties the optical absorbance and photoluminescence pl spectra of the three films are illustrated in figure 5 a b interestingly bandgap e g absorption is more pronounced and sharper in the dmso‐derived films in addition to the lowest bandgap absorption higher energy absorption peaks at ≈570 and ≈607 nm corresponding to the n 2 and 3 phases are also observed for all films 50 meanwhile the e g values determined using tauc plot decrease from 1.71 ± 0.004 to 1.62 ± 0.002 and 1.62 ± 0.001 ev for the dmf‐25 °c dmso dmf‐25 °c and dmso dmf‐90 °c films figure 5 c this finding clearly implies lower e g as one of origins for higher j sc in the dmso‐derived devices pl spectra exhibit dominated peaks at ≈719 nm 1.72 ev ≈772 nm 1.61 ev and ≈762 nm 1.63 ev for the dmf‐25 °c dmso dmf‐25 °c and dmso dmf‐90 °c cases respectively meanwhile an additional peak at ≈624 nm 1.98 ev associated to the n 2 phase 30 is found for the dmf‐25 °c and dmso dmf‐25 °c films with higher intensity for the latter apparently concomitant effects can be obtained based on optical absorbance and emission spectra variation in phase purity and phase distribution the dmf‐25 °c and dmso dmf‐25 °c films tend to form less pure quantum wells with broad phase distribution the highest phase purity is achieved in the dmso dmf‐90 °c film with n predominantly located at 4 this phenomenon agrees well with the aforementioned x‐ray observations as shown in figure 3 furthermore we also observed a shift for the dominant peak resulting from phase transition difference the redshift for the dmso dmf‐25 °c film is likely due to the existence of much larger‐ n phases or even 3d perovskite while the blueshift for the dmf‐25 °c case is mainly caused by the low crystal quality the variation of pl linewidth for the dominant peak which is related to the crystal quality of 3d perovskites 5 6 11 is also studied for the three films figure 5 c the pl linewidth decreases from ≈100.94 to ≈74.38 and ≈70.93 mev for the dmf‐25 °c dmso dmf‐25 °c and dmso dmf‐90 °c films respectively this finding therefore confirms again the highest crystal quality in the dmso dmf‐90 °c film time‐resolved pl trpl spectroscopy was used to investigate the carrier lifetime of rdp films on glass figure 5 d and table s2 supporting information trpl displays increased lifetimes τ ave from 5.87 to 11.93 and 28.35 ns for the dmf‐25 °c dmso dmf‐25 °c and dmso dmf‐90 °c films respectively we ascribed the longer lifetime in the dmso dmf‐90 °c film to higher phase purity and fewer defects because of high textured film and high crystal quality which is beneficial for suppressing the charge recombination contrary lower carrier lifetime in the dmso dmf‐25 °c film highlights the influence of appearance of n 4 phases because free carriers exist at the layer‐edge states only for larger‐ n phases 25 the results therefore establish that carrier lifetime of rdp films originates mainly from the intrinsic crystalline quality while the phase purity is also playing a role the most interesting observation in the kinetics study finds that solution casting ba 2 ma 3 pb 4 i 13 precursors on the preheated substrate promotes a direct phase transition from disordered precursor sol–gel to the rdp phase without formation of intermediate phases this phase transition is driven by the fast dissociation of precursor–solvent complexes at the solution/substrate interface as such crystallization via template‐induced nucleation and growth leads to thermodynamically preferred perpendicular quantum well orientation due to homogeneous distribution of large cation in the absence of intermediate phases high purity quantum wells can be obtained for the desired rdp with phase distribution centered close to the expected n set by the precursor ratios the strongly perpendicular alignment of quantum wells with high film quality and phase purity enable a more efficient carrier transport and long carrier lifetime which result in a high j sc and pce 12.17 in contrast intermediate phases are preferentially formed during slowed film formation due to strong interactions of lewis acid adduct 35 and hydrogen bond between solvent and precursors smaller‐ n rdps with lower nucleation barrier are more readily formed when intermediate phases crystallize to rdps in this scenario quantum wells with wide phase distribution are more favored even though the molar ratio of used precursors is intended for a single phase likewise the substrate does not template rdp phases for nucleation and growth this is likely the primary reason that solution casting on the low temperature substrate yields poor quantum well orientation 24 the poor quantum well orientation and low crystal quality for the dmf‐25 °c film dramatically hinder charge mobility in the perpendicular direction and therefore yield a low j sc and ff in devices 24 noteworthy orientation and phase distribution of quantum wells vary but other structural properties are comparable for the dmso dmf‐25 °c film in contrast to the 90 °c case due to larger exciton binding energy the smaller‐ n phases appearing in the dmso dmf‐25 °c case hint a challenge in the exciton dissociation and carrier collection in devices 24 25 with this in mind it is easy to see our conclusions concerning synthesis of rdp members with pure phase and perfect quantum well orientation which is important for identifying the physical limits and exploring the interesting new physics 51 overall our results suggest the significant importance of phase transition during solution casting ba 2 ma 3 pb 4 i 13 perovskite the phase transition kinetics observed here can be generally applied to the most a n a′ n −1 m n x 3 n +1 rdp structures we believe significant advances in understanding rdp formation and controlling phase purity quantum well orientation and film quality would direct rdps toward more desirable optoelectronic properties and device performance solution preparation and device fabrication the perovskite solution 1.2 m was comprised of bai 99.5
