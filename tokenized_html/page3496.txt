from the game awards 2018 and naturally rumours of potential announcements are starting to fly around the latest word on the street is that sony is readying a trio of release dates for three of its own ps4 exclusives death stranding ghost of tsushima and dreams this comes from a brazilian website combo infinito which claims to have received an email from sony brazil plainly stating the above information via google translate here 's the supposed email from sony update release windows for death stranding and ghost of tsushima will be revealed during this year 's edition of the game awards next month official release date of dreams will also be announced combo infinito also speculates that this means we 'll be seeing new footage from the three enigmatic titles it 's not impossible that sony will show up at the game awards with something new but to throw out several release dates for some of its biggest games at a third party event does n't sound right to us granted last year 's event debuted a new trailer for death stranding but we 'd expect sony to reveal dates for these games itself not via something like geoff keighley 's glitzy awards show take this one with a barrel of salt will sony be making announcements at the game awards 2018 will we see more from the likes of death stranding and ghost of tsushima or is this rumour a load of rubbish sound off in the comments below via comboinfinito.com.br resetera.com about stephen tailby having grown up alongside playstation stephen has developed a wide knowledge of video games from aaa blockbusters to the smallest indie gems he also has the platinum for the witness so there s that comments 55 maybe a new trailer for one of them most likely death stranding will end with a date but not all three then again i was recently wrong about that e3 rumour no the last of us part 2 for release date sobbing sniff sniff haha uhm nope i really wan na believe this cause im excited for death stranding but i do n't believe it do n't be so quick to dismiss kids we 've seen that sony has been doing things 'differently as of late i 'll take a firm stance of i 'll believe it when i see it i was surprised that sony announced a date for days gone which subsequently changed at e3 as they had been keeping the reveal of the dates pretty close to the release a few months i ca n't see them announcing dates that far advance after having delayed days gone and all the other games that have had delays i would prefer sony to announce release dates a few months before a game releases rather than 6+ months and then end up having to delay it its possible that dreams and even ghost of tsushima could get a release date dreams has seemed to been in development for years and its coming up to 4yrs now since infamous so maybe they are close to the finish line death stranding though seemed a lot less 'ready to release although some of that could be because the world seemed very empty and we just got the character walking in it which could be to avoid spoilers as such it seemed more like a test demo to see if their character and animation was working not falling through the world not getting stuck on things and moving the way they hoped still a long way from being a 'game so i would be more surprised if that was giving a release date push square does n't believe it but we all know what happened the last time they said that why could n't it be tlou 2 smh get2sammyb like we did n't believe that sony wo n't be at e3 these are strange times we live in nothing is impossible now adamnovice hapuc touche get2sammyb sony need reveal release date for the last of us part 2.. it is biggest anticipated game for everyone who loved first one rdr2october26 i 'm sure they 'll tell us when they 're ready ck97 yes i am dying to know release date for tlou 2. hopefully it come out in 2019 instead 2020 you now what after the whole ff7 remake/last guardian/shenmue 3 and now sony not attending e3 2019 rumor is actually true i can believe maybe this rumor is true.. get2sammyb yeah i am worrying about it push to 2020. yeah it is most wanted game why would n't anyone believe it apart from ghost of tsushima the other 2 games have been in production way to long and are 2019 releases anyway rdr2october26 i doubt it 'll be out next year to be honest not impossible but i 'd be surprised get2sammyb yeah neil druckman said it is 50-60 percent done in december 2017 so right now 80-90 percent done it will be completed 100 percent during summer then they polishing it for few months but maybe it release in october 2019 good games alway come out in october every year death stranding yes reveal date dreams beta date announced no official release date got- no way i genuinely believe that both ghost and tlou2 are launch cross-gen titles but probably not is pushsquare a bit like pachter when they give their opinions its safe to assume its the opposite edit also its says release windows not release date lol i just got pissed i somehow read the title but skipped the word rumor and then saw it afterwards i want a date for the last of us 2. ghost of tshushima cant wait for that game.release the beast.word up son i ca n't see that happening with death stranding kojima will take years to make that game which is fine by me because he is a god and all his past games have been worth the wait the other 2 games maybe but i ca n't see it really dreams should be out next year i guess tho individually anyone of them would ve been believable but i don t think sony has ever announce the release date of multiple games at one event except maybe the launch titles for new console i do n't want to rain on anyone 's parade here but i 'm brazilian and after reading the original statement i believe the correct translation should be that release windows may be revealed rdr2october26 they should release it the same day as the e3 xbox conference i wonder if people would still go 'but but e3 haha i ve always thought tlou ii would be last to release though 2020 just before ps5 launch mrbert i just read the source and seems like you 're right indeed if i 'm correct they 're saying a release window for ghost and death stranding may be revealed but a release date for dreams will be revealed that actually sounds pretty reasonable but portugese is not my native language at all so correct me if i misinterpreted here considering geoff spends half the night trying to get into kojima 's pants i would n't be surprised to get a death stranding release window during the show and that window will be 2019 ghosts could also get a late 2019 window dreams beta will go live during the show hence getting a release window for the beta i mean it 's been 3 years should n't take any company longer than 3 years to make a beta you can thank me later octane sony canceled psx they are taking over tga shawn layden did name drop dreams as the definite 2019 games alongside days gone and concrete genie i think we 'll get a beta launch date i 'm sure the latest on death stranding is that the game is in the polishing phase but that could be anything from 6 to 12 months from release and has for got well we 've only had two trailers for it so far so that might be further away 2019 could be another good year for ps4 then still waiting on concrete genie myself kidfried yes you 're absolutely right that 's what i got from the official statement anyway sony have been really unpredictable lately with playstation so anything is possible these days i wouldnt be surprised if dreams got a release date with an o btw the beta is live now there has been so much coverage recently it cant be far out why would sony brazil send this info to one outlet only also the article says poder√£o ser reveladas which means may be revealed i would be suprised if death stranding gets a release window instead of the tlou 2. but then again i also find it strange that all 3 games would get a release date except tlou i will be disappointed if ghost of tsushima gets a release window rather than a date if it will be a release window then that means that will be a post summer 2019 at the earliest i hope this isnt the case i would like it to come out may/june yeah i do n't see that happening i mean they are are skipping e3 next year might makes sense to put out some release dates and windows to calm everybody down doubt it but it would be nice to see a release date for dreams i 'm sorry for the long tangent in advance i 'd be surprised if sony announced the release date for death stranding i think that 's probably a 2020 game saying that we 're talking about sony and kojima here so nothing should surprise me really as mentioned in a comment above a release window is more likely than a specific date and dreams is long overdue so why not on a separate slightly related note- of the currently announced ps4 exclusives left to come out dreams days gone concrete genie mlb the show shenmue 3 last of us 2 ghosts of tshushima and death stranding i 'd be happy if one or two of these are due 2020 as that 's a lot of ps4 exclusives for 2019 not to mention the usual multi platform and vr games also with recent releases of huge games like assassin 's creed oddessy and rdr2 clocking in at 60+ hours not to mention all the season passes and online games etc it 's hard enough to keep up it 's great not quite sure how i ended up here but i think my point is it 's an amazing time to be a gamer if no more ps4 exclusives were announced and i 'm sure they will the ps4 will still be getting a brilliant send-off over the next couple of years and i 've heard mark cerny is taking home the best esports coach award rjejr fine by me lol should make the show more enjoyable to watch hope this is not true a release for dreams is fine but i m hoping the others are ps5 launch titles ps_nation hi do you think the last of us 2 release in 2019 likely october rdr2october26 most likely a ps5 release same as death stranding i definitely expect new trailers for all three games but only one of them will have a legit release date the others will have vague release window updates good strategy for sony the game awards has millions of viewers rdr2october26 well i m not the best source lol but i wouldn t bet on this release date starhops neil druckmann said it gon na be ps4 and will be cross gen later after ps5 coming out nothing gets me more excited than dates prunes maybe i 'm not sure about ghost of tsushima and dreams but i 'm quite sure death stranding will get a release date if you follow the analysing community you already know why and if not i guess just wait and we 'll see that 's sounds very odd if anything last of us 2 should be the highlight reveal the release date ghost of tushima was only revealed at the very end of 2017 for that to get a release date not last of us 2 is baffling thunderlips69 it really is n't sony specifically mentioned that they waited to reveal ghost of tsushima because they wanted to decrease the time between reveal and release they have gotten a bit of backlash after revealing some games way too early we 've had three e3 's of spider-man for example so it 's understandable that they wanted to change that strategy i think ghost is coming sooner than people think sometime in 2019 that 's still one-and-a-half years between reveal and release but definitely shorter than 2 or 3+ years tap here to load 55 comments leave a comment hold on there you need to login to post a comment red dead redemption 2 gets big ps4 update that adds a load of
