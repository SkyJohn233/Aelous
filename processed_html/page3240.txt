Save Data as Binary Using ObjectOutputStream - Stack Overflow                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 My application lets users choose some objects, and when they hit "submit", it is sent to the model. When the user presses "save" then currently the model is outputted to a fileName.dat and this file can be loaded back into the application and this will load their selected object. It works flawlessly, however, I want to be able to save the model in a binary format and then be able to load that file. I want to do this using ObjectOutputStream, or if this isn't possible then I don't mind using another method. This is my code: Thank you :) EDIT:This is what the file is currently saved as (this is what shows up when I open the .dat file in SublimeText) Your current solution already works for what you want it to do. The output would be binary. For the details of how to serialize to binary vs other formats (such as XML) the following is a  good tutorial . As you can see your method is described here as the correct way to serialize to binary.
