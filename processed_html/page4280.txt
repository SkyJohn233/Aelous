Packard Industries , aka Kanter Auto Products, has been selling Packard parts since 1960.  I'm not sure if this sign is vintage or a reproduction.  In 2017, the company began consolidating its operations and moving inventory from this location to another one nearby.  I believe the Packard sign hangs on that building now.

The blade sign appears to be from then.  These Dutch Boy Paints signs were mass-produced and there are still a number of them around the country.    [map] Woolley's Fish Market  features this giant lobster sign on their roof.  The neon appears to be in good shape so I would believe this sign is lit at night.    [map] D  Boat World Green Brook, NJ McMillan's Bakery [gone] Haddon Township, NJ Angeloni's Cedar Gardens Liquor Store [gone] Hamilton, NJ D  Boat World  opened here in 1956.

The sign at  Mom's Diner , formerly Mom's Peppermill Restaurant, used to be animated.  The crank of the peppermill would turn and the lights blinked out ground pepper.  The decaying sign was repainted yellow as part of a major 2003 restaurant makeover when it became Chef Giorgio's Mom's Diner.  Although the neon was not restored, the crank and upper piece with "Exit" and "8" were repaired and spinning again.  The restaurant closed around 2007 and was still vacant in 2017.  The sign is still there.    [map] The  Clam Broth House  restaurant opened in 1899.  The name came from the broth, served free of charge, that was made from the water used to boil the steamed clams.  The restaurant closed in 2003 when structural damage was discovered.  The building was demolished in 2004.  There were originally three of these pointing hand signs.  One was located outside the restaurant, pointing downwards towards the entrance.  That giant yellow sign is reportedly in storage.  There was also a smaller one directly above the entrance, pointing inward toward the building.  The third one, located across the street and shown above, is the only one that remains on display.  In 2010, a new Clam Broth House restaurant opened.  For more, see these websites:   1  and  2 .   [map] I believe the  Hotel Victor  was built in 1916.  This sign appears to be from the 1920s.

[map] Starr's [gone] Jersey City, NJ Colgate Clock Jersey City, NJ Orthopedic Shoe Repair Lake Como, NJ The  Starr's  restaurant was long gone but this sign was still there in 2011 when this photo was taken.  The building was demolished in 2015 and the sign is gone.     This  Colgate Clock  was built in 1924.  It is the world's largest clock with a 50 foot in diameter face.  The minute hand is 25 feet long.  The design was based on Colgate's Octagon Soap.  It is actually the second such clock erected in Jersey City.  The first was built in 1906 and was 38 feet in diameter.  This older sign was moved to  Jeffersonville, IN .  This clock that replaced it is lit at night and supposedly still works.  However, when I was there in 2007, it was not operating.  In 1983, the signage below the clock was altered.  The letters spelling out "Soaps Perfumes" were replaced with a toothpaste tube.  When the clock was moved to the ground, this part of the sign was replaced with a simple red rectangular Colgate sign.  In 2013, the clock was completely rebuilt with new hands, face, and LED lighting.   For more, see these websites:   1 ,  2 , and  3 . The  Orthopedic Shoe Repair  sign appears to be pre-1950s.
