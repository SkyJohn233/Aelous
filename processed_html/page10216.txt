LinkLabel.Link.LinkData Property (System.Windows.Forms) | Microsoft Docs Gets or sets the data associated with the link. An  Object  representing the data associated with the link. The following example demonstrates using the  LinkLabel  class, with multiple  LinkArea  sections defined, to display a label on a form. The example demonstrates setting the  AutoSize ,  LinkBehavior ,  DisabledLinkColor ,  LinkColor , and  VisitedLinkColor  properties to customize the look of the  LinkLabel . The first  LinkArea  is specified using the  LinkLabel.LinkArea  property. Additional links are added to the  LinkLabel  using the  LinkLabel.LinkCollection.Add  method. The example handles the  LinkClicked  event by starting the Web browser for hyperlinks, and displaying a  MessageBox  for other links. You can use this property to supply information related to the link. The information provided by this property can be used within the  LinkClicked  event of the  LinkLabel  to provide information about the link that can be used to process the link being clicked. For example, you can specify the URL to display in Internet Explorer when the link is clicked as the value of the  LinkData  property. You can also use the  LinkData  property to identify a dialog to display when the user clicks on the link. Thank you. Thank you.
