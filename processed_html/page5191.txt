To assess the cytogenetic and embryoscopic characteristics of primary and secondary recurrent pregnancy loss. Clinical prospective descriptive study. Tertiary care center. Nine hundred and eighty-four women affected by first-trimester pregnancy loss; 145 patients with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and 839 patients with nonrecurrent pregnancy loss as controls. Transcervical embryoscopic examination of the embryo before uterine evacuation, and cytogenetic analysis of the chorionic villi by standard G-banding cytogenetic techniques. Aneuploidy frequency in the primary and secondary RPL group and the nonrecurrent pregnancy loss (non-RPL) control group. Patients with RPL showed statistically significantly fewer aneuploid pregnancy losses (odds ratio [OR] 0.596; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40–0.88). Primary RPL was associated with lower aneuploidy rates compared with the non-RPL group (OR 0.423; 95% CI, 0.27–0.66) while secondary RPL was not (OR 1.414; 95% CI, 0.67–2.99). Patients with primary RPL had statistically significantly more morphologically normal embryos compared with non-RPL and secondary RPL. Patients’ embryos after primary and secondary RPL show distinctive differences in aneuploidy and morphologic defect rates. These findings suggest different treatment approaches for the patients with primary and secondary RPL. Discuss:  You can discuss this article with its authors and with other ASRM members at  https://www.fertstertdialog.com/users/16110-fertility-and-sterility/posts/12201-22724 It is estimated that 15% of naturally conceived pregnancies result in miscarriage, with the majority occurring in the first 12 weeks of gestation. Up to 50% of all women experience at least one sporadic miscarriage in their life ( 1 x 1 Rai, R. and Regan, L.  Recurrent miscarriage.  Lancet .  2006 ;         368 :  601 611 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (695)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (1) . Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), however, is estimated to affect 1% of couples ( 2 x 2 Stirrat, G.M.  Recurrent miscarriage.  Lancet .  1990 ;         336 :  673 675 Abstract  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (447)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (2) . The most common cause of miscarriage is aneuploidies, causing 50%–70% of all pregnancy losses ( 3 x 3 Hassold, T.J.  A cytogenetic study of repeated spontaneous abortions.  Am J Hum Genet .  1980 ;         32 :  723 730 PubMed  |  Google Scholar See all References ,  4 x 4 Simpson, J.L.  Causes of fetal wastage.  Clin Obstet Gynecol .  2007 ;         50 :  10 30 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (62)  |  Google Scholar See all References ), but other factors such as coagulation or immune disorders and anatomic abnormalities have also been associated with recurrent miscarriage ( 5 x 5 Branch, D.W., Gibson, M.,  and Silver, R.M.  Clinical practice. Recurrent miscarriage.  N Engl J Med .  2010 ;         363 :  1740 1747 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (201)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (5) . Thus, the diagnostic workup after RPL typically includes an analysis of the parental karyotype, maternal lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-β 2  glycoprotein 1, evaluation of maternal uterine anatomy by hysteroscopy, hysterosalpingogram, or sonohysterogram, and evaluation of thyroid or prolactin anomalies as suggested by the corresponding American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines ( 6 x 6 Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive M.  Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion.  Fertil Steril .  2012 ;         98 :  1103 1111 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (322)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (6) . If this workup does not reveal any pathologic results, the RPL is designated as unexplained, and expectant management is suggested ( 7 x 7 Murugappan, G., Shahine, L.K., Perfetto, C.O., Hickok, L.R.,  and Lathi, R.B.  Intent to treat analysis of in vitro fertilization and preimplantation genetic screening versus expectant management in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss.  Hum Reprod .  2016 ;         31 :  1668 1674 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (30)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (7) . Several studies have failed to show any beneficial effects for treatment strategies such as low-molecular-weight heparin, progesterone, or preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) in this group of unexplained RPL ( 7 x 7 Murugappan, G., Shahine, L.K., Perfetto, C.O., Hickok, L.R.,  and Lathi, R.B.

Ann Intern Med .  2015 ;         162 :  601 609 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (42)  |  Google Scholar See all References ). However, due to the high prevalence of RPL, cytogenetic analyses of fetuses in recurrent miscarriage are of high interest to determine the causes of miscarriage and make conclusions for further treatment ( 10 x 10 Bettio, D., Venci, A.,  and Levi Setti, P.E.  Chromosomal abnormalities in miscarriages after different assisted reproduction procedures.  Placenta .  2008 ;         29 :  126 128 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (67)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (10) . It has been found that the fetuses in early miscarriage have a high degree of morphologic abnormalities, correlating with cytogenetic findings ( 11 x 11 Kalousek, D.K.  Clinical significance of morphologic and genetic examination of spontaneously aborted embryos.  Am J Reprod Immunol .  1998 ;         39 :  108 119 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (10)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (11) . This valuable information is often lost by conventional evacuation of the uterus, but it can be obtained by transcervical embryoscopy, which allows precise tissue sampling of the embryo for further genetic analysis, with minimal risk of maternal cell contamination ( 12 x 12 Philipp, T., Philipp, K., Reiner, A., Beer, F.,  and Kalousek, D.K.  Embryoscopic and cytogenetic analysis of 233 missed abortions: factors involved in the pathogenesis of developmental defects of early failed pregnancies.  Hum Reprod .  2003 ;         18 :  1724 1732 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (142)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (12) . In the present study, for the first time we have assessed the morphologic and cytogenetic characteristics in primary and secondary RPL. The study population included 984 women who were affected by first-trimester recurrent and nonrecurrent missed abortion. Pregnancies included were both natural conceptions and in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF–ICSI) conceptions. Only pregnancies with ultrasonographic evidence of a negative fetal heartbeat were included in this study. The patients had been referred for detailed transcervical embryoscopic and cytogenetic evaluation of the nonviable embryo to the Danube Hospital (Vienna, Austria). The study was approved by the ethics committee of the hospital, and informed consent for transcervical embryoscopy was obtained from all patients. The transcervical embryoscopy has been described in detail elsewhere ( 12 x 12 Philipp, T., Philipp, K., Reiner, A., Beer, F.,  and Kalousek, D.K.  Embryoscopic and cytogenetic analysis of 233 missed abortions: factors involved in the pathogenesis of developmental defects of early failed pregnancies.  Hum Reprod .  2003 ;         18 :  1724 1732 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (142)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (12) . Briefly, transcervical embryoscopy and subsequent curettage were performed under intravenous general anesthesia. After careful dilatation of the cervix, the rigid hysteroscope (12-degree angle of view with both biopsy and irrigation working channel, Circon Ch 25–8 mm) was inserted transcervically into the uterine cavity and the implantation site of the pregnancy was visualized. Continuous normal saline flow was used throughout the procedure (pressure ranging from 40 to 120 mm Hg) to clean the operative field. Embryoscopic findings were classified into three categories: [1] embryos showing normal development, [2] embryos with isolated or combined external defects, and [3] growth-disorganized (GD) embryos. Additionally, the uterine cavity has been assessed regarding anatomical anomalies during embryoscopy. Karyotyping was attempted in all cases. Chorionic villi were obtained by direct chorion biopsies. The chorionic villi were placed in normal saline and carefully dissected. They were then placed in culture medium (Chang Medium C; Irvine Scientific) and immediately forwarded to the cytogenetic laboratory for further processing. The tissue was subsequently cultured and analyzed cytogenetically, using standard G-banding cytogenetic techniques. Comparative genomic hybridization in combination with flow cytometry analysis (CGH/FCM) of paraffin-embedded or frozen placental tissue was performed in 51 cases in which traditional cytogenetic analysis had failed to provide results ( 13 x 13 Lomax, B., Tang, S., Separovic, E., Phillips, D., Hillard, E., Thomson, T. et al.  Comparative genomic hybridization in combination with flow cytometry improves results of cytogenetic analysis of spontaneous abortions.  Am J Hum Genet .  2000 ;         66 :  1516 1521 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (120)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (13) . Primary RPL was defined as three or more consecutive pregnancy losses with no previous successful pregnancies. Secondary RPL included women with three or more consecutive pregnancy losses after a successful pregnancy ( 2 x 2 Stirrat, G.M.  Recurrent miscarriage.  Lancet .  1990 ;         336 :  673 675 Abstract  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (447)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (2) . Patients were included in the recurrent miscarriage group as soon as they presented with their third consecutive pregnancy loss. As primary outcome measure, we chose aneuploidy frequency in the primary and secondary RPL group and the nonrecurrent pregnancy loss (non-RPL) control group. As secondary outcome measures, we chose frequency of morphologic defects in the primary and secondary RPL group and the non-RPL control group. Categorical variables were analyzed using a chi-square test and multivariable regression analysis correcting for female age as a major confounder of aneuploidy. Continuous variables were analyzed using Mann-Whitney  U  test. All analysis were performed using SPSS version 23 (IBM) the statistical significance level was set to 0.05 two-sided. Out of 984 investigated patients, 145 presented with recurrent miscarriage (95 primary RPL and 50 secondary RPL) and 839 controls with nonrecurrent pregnancy loss. Patients in the non-RPL control group were statistically significantly younger than the patients with RPL ( Table 1 Table 1 ). Out of 984 obtained samples, 961 could be used for further genetic analysis; 23 samples could not be analyzed due to growth failure. In multivariable regression analysis taking female age into account, patients with RPL showed statistically significantly lower odds of having an aneuploid embryo (odds ratio [OR] 0.596; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40–0.88;  P =.009). Note:  CRL = crown-rump length; RPL = Recurrent pregnancy loss; NS = not statistically significant. When we performed the subgroup analysis, the patients with primary RPL showed statistically significantly lower odds of aneuploid pregnancy compared with the non-RPL group (OR 0.423; 95% CI, 0.27–0.66;  P < .001) and with patients with secondary RPL (OR 0.298; 95% CI, 0.13–0.70;  P =.006). Patients with secondary RPL did not show any differences regarding aneuploid pregnancy compared with the non-RPL group (OR 1.414; 95% CI, 0.67–2.99;  P =.365) ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 ). Distribution of karyotypes in the control, primary recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), and secondary RPL groups. The distribution of the karyotype characteristics is visualized in  Figure 2 Figure 2 . Patients with RPL showed comparable numbers of previous abortions in the euploid and the aneuploid RPL groups (2.70 vs. 2.51 in the euploid vs. the aneuploid RPL groups, respectively;  P =.661). Visualization of the distribution of karyotype aberrations. RPL, recurrent pregnancy loss. Patients with RPL did not show statistically significant differences regarding normally developed embryos compared with the non-RPL group ( P =.480). In the subgroup analysis, patients with primary RPL had a statistically significantly higher number of normally developed embryos compared with the patients with secondary RPL ( P =.012) and non-RPL ( P =.040). The number of normally developed embryos was not statistically significantly different between the secondary RPL and the control group ( P =.080) (see  Table 1 Table 1 ). Generally, aneuploidy was correlated with morphologic defects ( P < .001), but even in euploid embryos a majority of embryos appeared with morphologic defects. The distribution of the morphologic characteristics in euploid and aneuploid pregnancy losses is shown in  Figure 3 Figure 3 . Visualization of the distribution of morphology characteristics in the different groups in euploid and aneuploid pregnancy loss. GD, growth disorganized; RPL, recurrent pregnancy loss. In the present study, women with RPL showed statistically significantly lower levels of aneuploidy compared with women with non-RPL. However, patients with secondary RPL showed no differences in aneuploidy rates compared with the non-RPL patients. Patients with primary RPL had a higher number of morphologically normal embryos compared with the non-RPL and secondary RPL group. Still, a majority of embryos presented with morphologic defects. Patients with aneuploid and euploid RPL show distinctive differences in their prognosis. Euploid pregnancy loss raises the odds for a consecutive euploid pregnancy loss, with correlated detrimental prognosis compared with aneuploid pregnancy loss ( 3 x 3 Hassold, T.J.  A cytogenetic study of repeated spontaneous abortions.

On the other hand, embryos from patients undergoing preimplantation genetic diagnosis after viable and nonviable trisomic pregnancies were associated with high rates of aneuploidy, suggesting a high risk of repeated embryonic aneuploidy also in this group ( 16 x 16 Munne, S., Sandalinas, M., Magli, C., Gianaroli, L., Cohen, J.,  and Warburton, D.  Increased rate of aneuploid embryos in young women with previous aneuploid conceptions.  Prenat Diagn .  2004 ;         24 :  638 643 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (77)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (16) . The risk of suffering spontaneous pregnancy loss and RPL is associated with increased maternal age and fast-rising oocyte aneuploidy rates in this group ( 3 x 3 Hassold, T.J.  A cytogenetic study of repeated spontaneous abortions.  Am J Hum Genet .  1980 ;         32 :  723 730 PubMed  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (3) . Consequently, maternal age and number of previous miscarriages are detrimental prognosis factors to achieve one healthy pregnancy ( 17 x 17 Lund, M., Kamper-Jorgensen, M., Nielsen, H.S., Lidegaard, O., Andersen, A.M.,  and Christiansen, O.B.  Prognosis for live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage: what is the best measure of success?.  Obstet Gynecol .  2012 ;         119 :  37 43 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (49)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (17) . It may be assumed that in the present study a large amount of patients after aneuploid secondary RPL already had aneuploid pregnancy loss before. Even though the probability to have a consecutive aneuploid conception is high ( 16 x 16 Munne, S., Sandalinas, M., Magli, C., Gianaroli, L., Cohen, J.,  and Warburton, D.  Increased rate of aneuploid embryos in young women with previous aneuploid conceptions.  Prenat Diagn .  2004 ;         24 :  638 643 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (77)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (16) , it may be emphasized that there is a chance for euploid conception after repeated attempts. However, if the RPL is caused by maternal factors, consecutive pregnancies will not lead to a live-birth, hence euploid RPL might be associated with an overall inferior prognosis ( 15 x 15 Ogasawara, M., Aoki, K., Okada, S.,  and Suzumori, K.  Embryonic karyotype of abortuses in relation to the number of previous miscarriages.  Fertil Steril .  2000 ;         73 :  300 304 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (306)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (15) . Therefore, routine checkup of RPL consisting of uterine anatomy evaluation, parental karyotypes, maternal lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-β 2  glycoprotein 1, and thyroid and prolactin levels is recommended ( 6 x 6 Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive M.  Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion.  Fertil Steril .  2012 ;         98 :  1103 1111 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (322)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (6) . In cases with a family history of thromboembolic events, additional tests for coagulation disorders are encouraged ( 6 x 6 Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive M.  Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion.  Fertil Steril .  2012 ;         98 :  1103 1111 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (322)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (6) . After routine checkup, a majority of patients will present with unexplained RPL ( 1 x 1 Rai, R. and Regan, L.  Recurrent miscarriage.  Lancet .  2006 ;         368 :  601 611 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (695)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (1) . Several studies have investigated different therapeutic approaches in this group of patients. Neither progesterone supplementation nor low-molecular-weight heparin could provide positive effects in preventing unexplained RPL ( 8 x 8 Coomarasamy, A., Williams, H., Truchanowicz, E., Seed, P.T., Small, R., Quenby, S. et al.  A Randomized trial of progesterone in women with recurrent miscarriages.  N Engl J Med .  2015 ;         373 :  2141 2148 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (85)  |  Google Scholar See all References ,  9 x 9 Schleussner, E., Kamin, G., Seliger, G., Rogenhofer, N., Ebner, S., Toth, B. et al.

Ann Intern Med .  2015 ;         162 :  601 609 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (42)  |  Google Scholar See all References ). Other studies have suggested the treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) in cases of secondary unexplained RPL, but randomized studies failed to show any positive effect on pregnancy or live-birth rates ( 18 x 18 Jauniaux, E., Farquharson, R.G., Christiansen, O.B.,  and Exalto, N.  Evidence-based guidelines for the investigation and medical treatment of recurrent miscarriage.

BJOG .  2015 ;         122 :  500 508 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (31)  |  Google Scholar See all References ). Taking our findings into account, this is not surprising because embryos of patients having RPL presented with high aneuploidy rates, with embryos of secondary RPL having the highest aneuploidy rates of all groups. Therefore, it seems unlikely that recently suggested treatment approaches such as tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor in unexplained RPL will prove effective in larger prospective studies if not performed in a selected group of patients with immunologic aberrations ( 21 x 21 Winger, E.E. and Reed, J.L.  Treatment with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and intravenous immunoglobulin improves live birth rates in women with recurrent spontaneous abortion.  Am J Reprod Immunol .  2008 ;         60 :  8 16 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (97)  |  Google Scholar See all References ,  22 x 22 Scarpellini, F. and Sbracia, M.

Hum Reprod .  2009 ;         24 :  2703 2708 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (133)  |  Google Scholar See all References ). In RPL, PGS could serve as a possible tool to avoid recurrent aneuploidy and achieve a healthy live birth ( 23 x 23 Feichtinger, M., Stopp, T., Gobl, C., Feichtinger, E., Vaccari, E., Madel, U. et al.  Increasing live birth rate by preimplantation genetic screening of pooled polar bodies using array comparative genomic hybridization.  PLoS One .  2015 ;         10 :  e0128317 Google Scholar See all References ) (23) . However, the results with PGS in RPL patients have been contradictory, with some investigators reporting beneficial results and another recent study reporting no effect compared with expectant management ( 7 x 7 Murugappan, G., Shahine, L.K., Perfetto, C.O., Hickok, L.R.,  and Lathi, R.B.  Intent to treat analysis of in vitro fertilization and preimplantation genetic screening versus expectant management in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss.  Hum Reprod .  2016 ;         31 :  1668 1674 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (30)  |  Google Scholar See all References ,  24 x 24 Rubio, C., Buendia, P., Rodrigo, L., Mercader, A., Mateu, E., Peinado, V. et al.  Prognostic factors for preimplantation genetic screening in repeated pregnancy loss.  Reprod Biomed Online .  2009 ;         18 :  687 693 Abstract  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (30)  |  Google Scholar See all References ). Patient selection, not distinguishing between primary and secondary RPL, might explain these diverging results. Our data show high rates of aneuploidy in embryos of patients with secondary RPL and spontaneous abortions, a group who could benefit most from PGS, whereas patients with primary RPL could benefit from conventional RPL screening due to their higher number of euploid embryos. Euploid RPL was associated with statistically significantly higher detection rates in conventional RPL screening compared with aneuploid RPL ( 25 x 25 Maslow, B.S., Budinetz, T., Sueldo, C., Anspach, E., Engmann, L., Benadiva, C. et al.  Single-nucleotide polymorphism-microarray ploidy analysis of paraffin-embedded products of conception in recurrent pregnancy loss evaluations.  Obstet Gynecol .  2015 ;         126 :  175 181 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (12)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (25) . Hence, considering that most embryos in primary and secondary RPL are aneuploid, primary cytogenetic analysis of the fetuses in RPL is less expensive and more cost effective than a first-line complete RPL checkup ( 26 x 26 Bernardi, L.A., Plunkett, B.A.,  and Stephenson, M.D.  Is chromosome testing of the second miscarriage cost saving? A decision analysis of selective versus universal recurrent pregnancy loss evaluation.  Fertil Steril .  2012 ;         98 :  156 161 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (27)  |  Google Scholar See all References ,  27 x 27 Foyouzi, N., Cedars, M.I.,  and Huddleston, H.G.

Our data support these findings, considering that even patients with primary RPL had more than 50% aneuploid embryos. Furthermore, cytogenetic testing of RPL is not only encouraged for therapeutic reasons but might also be valuable for psychological reasons ( 6 x 6 Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive M.  Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion.  Fertil Steril .  2012 ;         98 :  1103 1111 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (322)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (6) . As already observed by previous studies, embryos show morphologic defects in most cases, even when a euploid karyotype is present ( 12 x 12 Philipp, T., Philipp, K., Reiner, A., Beer, F.,  and Kalousek, D.K.  Embryoscopic and cytogenetic analysis of 233 missed abortions: factors involved in the pathogenesis of developmental defects of early failed pregnancies.  Hum Reprod .  2003 ;         18 :  1724 1732 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (142)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (12) . In patients with primary RPL we found statistically significantly more normally developed embryos compared with secondary RPL and non-RPL patients. However, even in this group, fewer than 20% of embryos showed normal development. The reason why euploid embryos sometimes display severe morphologic defects is not fully understood yet. Some investigators have reported DNA-copy number variation (CNV) aberrations in more than 30% of euploid embryos with morphologic defects ( 28 x 28 Rajcan-Separovic, E., Qiao, Y., Tyson, C., Harvard, C., Fawcett, C., Kalousek, D. et al.  Genomic changes detected by array CGH in human embryos with developmental defects.  Mol Hum Reprod .  2010 ;         16 :  125 134 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (35)  |  Google Scholar See all References ,  29 x 29 Robberecht, C., Pexsters, A., Deprest, J., Fryns, J.P., D’Hooghe, T.,  and Vermeesch, J.R.

Prenat Diagn .  2012 ;         32 :  933 942 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (35)  |  Google Scholar See all References ). So genetic factors contributing to morphologic embryonal defects seem to be underreported when classic karyotyping is applied. More modern microarray techniques, compared with standard karyotyping, offer the advantages of higher resolution, fewer tissue culture failures, and less maternal contamination ( 13 x 13 Lomax, B., Tang, S., Separovic, E., Phillips, D., Hillard, E., Thomson, T. et al.  Comparative genomic hybridization in combination with flow cytometry improves results of cytogenetic analysis of spontaneous abortions.  Am J Hum Genet .  2000 ;         66 :  1516 1521 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (120)  |  Google Scholar See all References ,  30 x 30 Rajcan-Separovic, E.  Chromosome microarrays in human reproduction.  Hum Reprod Update .  2012 ;         18 :  555 567 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (17)  |  Google Scholar See all References ). Due to the endoscopic-guided sampling of chorionic villi in our study we could support specific sampling of sufficient material for further analysis. Previous studies reported much lower aneuploidy rates in RPL (25%–30%) compared with our present analysis, which showed aneuploidy in more than 50% of cases ( 31 x 31 Carp, H., Toder, V., Aviram, A., Daniely, M., Mashiach, S.,  and Barkai, G.  Karyotype of the abortus in recurrent miscarriage.  Fertil Steril .  2001 ;         75 :  678 682 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (180)  |  Google Scholar See all References ,  32 x 32 Sullivan, A.E., Silver, R.M., LaCoursiere, D.Y., Porter, T.F.,  and Branch, D.W.

This effect might be attributed to higher rates of contamination with maternal cells when standard uterine evacuation is performed, with more than 50% of sampled XX embryos misdiagnosed ( 33 x 33 Lathi, R.B., Gustin, S.L., Keller, J., Maisenbacher, M.K., Sigurjonsson, S., Tao, R. et al.  Reliability of 46, XX results on miscarriage specimens: a review of 1,222 first-trimester miscarriage specimens.

In case of euploid XX results after karyotyping, some investigators therefore suggest microsatellite analysis (MSA), short-tandem-repeat (STR), or single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) techniques to rule out maternal contamination ( 34 x 34 Diego-Alvarez, D., Garcia-Hoyos, M., Trujillo, M.J., Gonzalez-Gonzalez, C., Rodriguez de Alba, M., Ayuso, C. et al.  Application of quantitative fluorescent PCR with short tandem repeat markers to the study of aneuploidies in spontaneous miscarriages.  Hum Reprod .  2005 ;         20 :  1235 1243 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (40)  |  Google Scholar See all References ,  35 x 35 Mathur, N., Triplett, L.,  and Stephenson, M.D.  Miscarriage chromosome testing: utility of comparative genomic hybridization with reflex microsatellite analysis in preserved miscarriage tissue.

In our present study the XX/XY rate was around 1, much lower that usually found in studies performing classic uterine evacuation, correlating with studies using sensitive SNP or microsatellite analysis to rule out maternal contamination ( 33 x 33 Lathi, R.B., Gustin, S.L., Keller, J., Maisenbacher, M.K., Sigurjonsson, S., Tao, R. et al.

Furthermore, due to the embryoscopic sampling in our study, 97.7% of samples could be genetically analyzed, a much higher rate compared with previously published data reporting around 50% to 75% of usable material ( 15 x 15 Ogasawara, M., Aoki, K., Okada, S.,  and Suzumori, K.  Embryonic karyotype of abortuses in relation to the number of previous miscarriages.  Fertil Steril .  2000 ;         73 :  300 304 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (306)  |  Google Scholar See all References ,  31 x 31 Carp, H., Toder, V., Aviram, A., Daniely, M., Mashiach, S.,  and Barkai, G.  Karyotype of the abortus in recurrent miscarriage.  Fertil Steril .  2001 ;         75 :  678 682 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (180)  |  Google Scholar See all References ). These advantages of the technique used in our study and the fact that age was correlated for as a cofactor in the statistical analysis might explain the higher rates of aneuploidy observed in our data. One previous study showed no differences in aneuploidy rates in primary and secondary RPL, but that study did not take the patients' age into account, a major factor contributing to aneuploidy ( 31 x 31 Carp, H., Toder, V., Aviram, A., Daniely, M., Mashiach, S.,  and Barkai, G.  Karyotype of the abortus in recurrent miscarriage.  Fertil Steril .  2001 ;         75 :  678 682 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (180)  |  Google Scholar See all References ) (31) . Ours is the first study to evaluate the morphologic and cytogenetic characteristic of embryos in primary and secondary RPL. We found distinctive differences in patients affected by primary RPL compared with secondary RPL. Because high levels of aneuploidy have been observed in the secondary RPL group, these patients might benefit from PGS. All three groups showed high rates of morphologic defects, even in euploid embryos, with the primary RPL group showing statistically significantly higher numbers of morphologically normal embryos. Future studies should aim at evaluating the effect of PGS in secondary RPL patients and at further investigating the possible causes for morphology defects in euploid embryos.
