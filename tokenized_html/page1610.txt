machine elves psychonaut i x27 ve been exploring this sub and the internet and from what i understand people only visualize machine elves while taking dmt however last night i was sleeping but it was interrupted by the feeling of a dog licking my face and walking above my pillow so i sat up as i did so i noticed something to the left of me and stared at what i believe to be a machine elf he was made of interconnected tubes that were gray in color and he had a very majestic feeling radiating from him he had two bright red eyes that turned to me and stared he then turned away and kept walking to the right of me i was skeptical of what i saw at first but i know that it had to be one i want to see him and others again so i x27 m going to try to meditate and/or lucid dream to produce my own dmt naturally any advice and information would be much appreciated i am very interested in knowing what this could mean how it could happen and if there are ways to recreate it i don x27 t have any advice but i have some encouragement i smoked dmt well over a hundred times in the course of a year a few years back and i ended up with permanent access to the edges of hyperspace if i meditate deeply i can still get it it x27 s my strong opinion that the world we access through dmt/ayahuasca is not only entirely real it x27 s always there if you can figure out how to navigate it reliably without dmt i x27 d consider that a breakthrough in science/human-exploration and i encourage you to work with that energy and report back to this sub about any developments p.s delete this you posted it twice i deleted the other one because someone else commented here i will try to meditate as much as possible to bring it back but i won x27 t force it i feel like that won x27 t help the cause thanks for the encouragement artist david choe featured on the joe rogan podcast claims to have access to that space all the time through waking life after ayahuasca experiences i x27 m glad you posted this i had a very relevant dream the other night well it wasn x27 t really a dream i was sort of in that in-between place of awake and asleep when i saw for no more than a second a humanoid geometric figure reaching out to me shocked i opened my eyes instantly and it was gone couldn x27 t sleep that much was very freaked out and the sleep i did manage to get ended in nightmares i am wondering what the deal is with these machine elves if that x27 s what i experienced was i x27 ve heard they x27 re supposed to be nothing but positive energy and for a second it felt that way but something astonishing took over and spooked my mind that x27 s almost how mine was my eyes were open but i was still between sleep and being fully alert i saw him for a while though probably a full half minute and when he was gone i just went back to sleep it didn x27 t feel frightening or negative it felt like being in the presence of a god for lack of a better work i was in awe the entire time 243k members 523 online dec 8 2008 cake day
