Before making the decision to buy your next car, you might want to read all our news, reviews and insights to make sure you are getting the best possible deal. Whoever says that cars are investments are only partly correct. The moment that you purchase your car from a  car dealership  it instantly loses its value. According to economic studies, a brand new car loses most of its value during the first 5 years of ownership. Luckily  Philkotse.com  has compiled some tips for you on how you can increase the value of your car. Your car is a finely tuned machine with a lot of moving metal parts. These parts rub against and hit each other many multiple times when you have your car on. Movement and vibration create friction which then, in turn, make heat. That same heat magnified many times over causes damage to your engine. Another thing is if you do not change the oil in your car, the oil turns bad and sludges up the car's insides. If you observe the car's proper maintenance and religiously follow the prescribed  PMS schedule , you will have that coveted manufacturer's maintenance diary. This document records all the times you sent the car over for maintenance and may include parts replaced and other mods. With that document, you can actually increase your car's value when the time comes to sell it. Apart from having your car mechanically sound, you have to package your car to be desirable to look at. Many car buyers relate a good-looking and presentable car to be a good car. Do not sell your vehicle if it has major scratches or dents in it as this will immediately send the car's resale value plummeting. Give it a fresh coat of paint and you will find that your investment in having the body repaired will pay off. Buyers will always be wary of a used car's history. In the Philippines, we do not have a central database to trace the history of the car from ownership to maintenance records. Keeping all documentation handy with you will create a sort of diary of everything that happened to your car, from maintenance work, modifications and part bought even ownership will create a sense of assurance to the buyer that it will be worth their money buying your car. Tires are one of your cars most important parts. The quality of your tires greatly affect the cars overall performance, handling, comfort, and demeanor. It is your vehicle's connection to the road and any imperfection is felt almost instantaneously. It is also a major safety concern to sell your car with busted tires. Spending on decent tires, much like repairing the body can add dividends to your car's resale value. The easiest, most cost-effective way to maintain your car's resale value is to drive safely.  Defensive driving  is an often thrown-around word that actually means so much to the car's resale value. If you drive safely and sensibly you can avoid collisions, it doesn't wear out the tires as much plus you have the distinction of selling your car in original and pristine condition. Much like trading cards in mint condition, keeping your car intact will be a major selling point for you.
