expression of ccn family of genes in human skin in vivo and alterations by solar-simulated ultraviolet irradiation we are experimenting with display styles that make it easier to read articles in pmc the epub format uses ebook readers which have several ease of reading features already built in the epub format is best viewed in the ibooks reader you may notice problems with the display of certain parts of an article in other ereaders generating an epub file may take a long time please be patient click on above to taihao quan sharon shin and gary j. fisher additional article information the ccn family of proteins is involved in diverse biological functions such as cell growth adhesion migration angiogenesis and regulation of extracellular matrix we have investigated expression of ccn family genes and alternations induced by solar-simulated ultraviolet irradiation in human skin in vivo transcripts of all six ccn genes were expressed in human skin in vivo ccn5 was most abundantly expressed followed by ccn2 x0003e ccn3 x0003e ccn1 x0003e ccn4 x0003e ccn6 solar-simulated ultraviolet irradiation increased mrna expression of ccn1 and ccn2 in contrast mrna levels of ccn3 ccn4 ccn5 and ccn6 were reduced knowledge gained from this study provides the foundation to explore the functional roles of ccn gene products in cutaneous biology and responses to solar ultraviolet irradiation human skin the largest organ of the body serves as a protective barrier to environmental damage skin is directly exposed to ultraviolet uv irradiation from the sun solar uv irradiation is a potent environmental factor that can deleteriously affect the structure and function of human skin acute exposure of human skin to uv irradiation causes sunburn altered pigmentation inflammation immune suppression and dermal connective tissue damage gilchrest and yaar 1992 kripke 1984 matsumura and ananthaswamy 2002 pathak 1986 chronic exposure to uv irradiation over many years disrupts normal skin and ultimately causes premature skin aging photoaging fisher et al 1996 fisher et al 1997 yaar and gilchrest 2007 and cancer gloster and brodland 1996 green and hedinger 2008 katiyar et al 2000 miller

et al 1990 however expression of ccn genes and their regulation by uv irradiation have not been studied in human skin in vivo here we quantified expression of the six ccn family genes and further explored the impact of acute uv-irradiated on ccn gene expression in human skin in vivo uv irradiation and procurement of human tissue samples human skin punch biopsies were obtained from healthy adult human volunteers as previously described fisher et al 1998 fisher et al 1997 fisher and voorhees 1998 fisher et al 1997 for uv irradiation sun-protected buttock skin was irradiated with 2 med

exposure all procedures involving human subjects were approved by the university of michigan institutional review board and all subjects provided written informed consent rna isolation and quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr total rna was isolated from human skin samples using a commercial kit rneasy mini kit qiagen chatsworth ca according to

when p x0003c 0.05 expression of ccn genes in normal human skin in vivo to explore expression of ccn genes in human skin in vivo total rna was prepared from full-thickness punch biopsies of adult human buttock skin and the mrna levels were determined by quantitative real-time rt-pcr figure x000a0 1 shows that transcripts of all six ccn genes were detected in adult human skin ccn5 was most abundantly expressed followed by ccn2 x0003e ccn3 x0003e ccn1 x0003e ccn4 x0003e ccn6 expression of ccn5 transcript was several-fold higher than that observed for other ccn transcripts mrna expression of all six ccn genes was relatively low compared to house keeping gene 36b4 and among them ccn6 was near the limit of detection regulation of ccn gene expression in human skin by uv irradiation to investigate whether solar-simulated uv irradiation alters ccn gene expression sun-protected human buttock skin was exposed to 2 med minimum erythema dose solar-simulated uv irradiation skin samples were then taken at 4 8 16 24 and 48 x000a0 h following uv irradiation total rna was prepared and mrna expression levels were determined by quantitative real-time rt-pcr uv irradiation caused modest

of uv-irradiation from the sun chronic exposures to uv irradiation over many years causes accumulative skin damage and eventually causes skin to age prematurely photoaging and leads to skin cancer

1984 pathak 1986 pathak et al 1993 photodamaged skin also provides a microenvironment that supports the development of skin cancers the most common type of cancer in the united states hales et al 1989 matsumura and ananthaswamy 2002 pilcher et al 1997 stamp et al 1988 more than a million people are diagnosed with skin cancer each year and current estimates are that 40 x02013 50 of americans who live to age 65 will have skin cancer at least once we found that all six ccn genes are expressed in human skin in vivo among them ccn5 is most highly expressed followed by ccn2 x0003e ccn3 x0003e ccn1 x0003e ccn4 x0003e ccn6 in general ccn1 and ccn2 are immediate early genes and are associated with cellular proliferation whereas ccn3-5 are associated with suppression of proliferation bleau et al

expression of proliferation-associated ccn genes ccn1 and ccn2 at early time points in human skin in vivo in contrast mrna expression of growth arrest-associated ccn genes ccn3 ccn4 ccn5 and ccn6 were reduced by solar-simulated uv irradiation at late time points in human skin in vivo taken together these mrna expression data suggest that ccn protein may be involved in the hyperproliferative response that follows exposure of human skin to acute uv irradiation fisher and voorhees 1998 fisher et al 1997 matsumura and ananthaswamy 2002 quan et al 2002b further investigations are required to
