page led zeppelin s musical virtuosity stage presence and breadth and depth of material are some of the challenges of doing zeppelin justice malave and mott said plant is known for his sexually charged vocals and audience command while page the essence of cool presides over an arsenal of heavy riffs and sublime acoustic patterns bonham is regularly cited as the best rock drummer who ever lived and jones is a bass and keyboard wizard renowned for his nuanced parts mott said he was mesmerized as a preteen by the band s ability to stretch musical boundaries on one album you ll hear six different genres he said for instance led zeppelin iii 1970 includes driving hard rock immigrant song out on the tiles acoustic numbers that s the way tangerine and traditional blues since i ve been loving you toto s first zep album was led zeppelin iv which he bought at a garage sale because he liked the album cover ironically the first zeppelin song i ever listened to was black dog toto said yet when one of the most popular songs of all time stairway to heaven came on toto lifted the needle the first few notes started and i thought it was too soft he said with a laugh black dog performs about 80 percent of zeppelin s catalog from legendary tracks like rock and roll and heartbreaker to more obscure nuggets such as hots on for nowhere and for your life. at some shows including this saturday the band replicates zeppelin s mid-show acoustic sets at a recent gig before a packed house at the emerson hotel in emerson toto played a mean slide guitar on in my time of dying malave conjured plant s multi-octave range on babe i m gon na leave you gori combined dexterity and power on the epic drum solo moby dick and mott let loose with fluid grooves on the song remains the same. there are several pros and cons to performing in a zeppelin tribute act mott said you have a pre-established fan base he said if we go into an area where we never played before people will come out to see if we can do it justice the single biggest pitfall is there s a lot of competition he added you have bands that tour nationally and do the theaters a lot of times a zeppelin act will book a room and it becomes their territory they ll tell the venue they won t play there if other zeppelin tribute bands are allowed to. each member of black dog said you can never truly master led zeppelin every time you listen there s always little subtleties that you may not have heard before said gori who also plays in the alternative rock band betty and has worked with former living colour bassist muzz skillings unlike some zeppelin tribute acts black dog band mates bear no physical resemblance to led zeppelin and looks are not the only way that the band differ from their icons they don t share zeppelin s myth-like status for wild partying some people want to hang out with us after the show malave said they ask where the party is where the girls are meanwhile we re heading home to our families it s kind of comical. saturday s show also features another local tribute band as the opening act in absentia a hasbrouck heights band featuring brothers jason and sean sproviero perform songs by progressive rock mastermind steven wilson and his band porcupine tree 2019 northjersey.com all rights reserved
