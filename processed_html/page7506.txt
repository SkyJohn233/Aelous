Rumor was a sentimental favorite of the crowd, having finished second in 2016. This marked the end of a drought for the breed, which had last won in 1987. Rumor was the nation &# x2019;s No. 1 show dog last year. But she fell short when a German shorthaired pointer named CJ won in a surprise, and it was thought that Rumor would retire. Q: Where are you going to put that enormous Best in Show rosette, and what lies ahead for Rumor? A:  &# x201C;(Big grin), it &# x2019;s going in the living room, and Rumor has romance in her future, and puppies! &# x201D; handler and owner Kent Boyles said. Rumor &# x2019;s full name is &# xA0; &# xA0;GCH CH Lockenhaus &# x2019; Rumor Has It V Kenlyn. Boyles was uncertain about his charge &# x2019;s chances entering Westminster after last year &# x2019;s near miss. Asked about the chances of 5-year-old Rumor adding to her 103 career championship ribbons, handler and co-owner Kent Boyles said,  &# x201C;I have no idea.  &# x2026; You never know. &# x201D; &# x201C;Really good competition, &# x201D; Boyles said, adding that he was  &# x201C;pretty nervous. &# x201D; The 5-year-old Rumor is named for the Adele hit song  &# x201C;Rumor Has It. &# x201D; This was the 104th career win for Rumor, and handler and co-owner Boyles said earlier in the day that this would definitely, for real, be her last major show. Rumor was one of seven dogs to advance to the Best in Show competition. The reeds represented in the final seven were a Boxer, Norwich Terrier, Irish Setter, Norwegian Elk Hound, Pekingese, Miniature Poodle and a German Shepherd. An Irish Setter took Reserve Best in Show, second place. For more on Rumor and her family, check out  this charming story from a couple years back.
