Purdey ' s - Thrive On - freuds freuds-gg-logo Purdey’s asked freuds to help create renewed affinity for the brand, build awareness and engage a wider audience. Working closely with the brand, freuds developed the concept of Thrive On, a platform for people who take life in their stride. Growing, learning and making the most of life’s possibilities. Our insight: work with influencers who mirror the Purdey’s attitude of Thrive On back to the audience, but do it in a deeper, truer way than before. Procure Worldwide identified Idris Elba as the ideal representative and embodiment of Thrive On and Purdey’s. However, to take this a step further beyond a typical endorsement deal, we appointed Idris as Creative Director for the platform.  As part of a far-reaching relationship with Purdey’s, Idris is charged with celebrating and inspiring people who follow their own path, who value a life built on experience and discovery, and who continue to strive to better themselves, through ‘real’ content that he himself is in charge of creating. Working closely with Britvic, as well as Idris’ management, agent and legal team, freuds and Procure Worldwide conceived the strategic partnership, brokered the multi-faceted commercial deal, and managed Idris through the process of media scenarios to content creation moments, up to delivery of the campaign in April 2016. Thrive On launched with a burst of earned media to announce the partnership and the campaign continues to gain momentum as we build on the initial success, ensuring a steady stream of engaging and authentic content from Idris and Purdey’s.
