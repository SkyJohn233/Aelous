what is the hud-1 settlement statement the hud-1 settlement statement is a standard government real estate form that was once used by settlement agents also called closing agents to itemize all charges imposed upon a borrower and seller for a real estate transaction the statement is no longer used with one exceptionâ€” reverse mortgages it was originally developed by the u.s. department of housing and urban development hud to give each party a complete list of their incoming and outgoing funds the statutes of the real estate settlement procedures act respa required that the hud-1 form be used as the standard real estate settlement form in all transactions in the united states that involved federally-related mortgage loans it was formerly used for nearly all transactions that involved a buyer and seller including cash closings you would have received a hud-1 statement if you applied for a mortgage on or before oct. 3 2015 borrowers began receiving a form called the closing disclosure instead of a hud-1 for most kinds of mortgage loans after october 2015 the change was in response to the tila respa integrated disclosures or simply trid which overhauled the way mortgages are processed and disclosed the hud-1 settlement statement is still used in 2019 for reverse mortgages these types of mortgages are very popular with sellers over the age of 62 who want to pull equity out of their homes lenders will also often ask for a copy of an old hud-1 to prove the date the property closed during the three- to 10-year period following a short sale prior to 2015 before oct. 3 2015 respa stated that borrowers should be given a copy of the hud-1 at least one day prior to settlement in real life however entries could easily still be coming in right up until a few hours before closing most buyers and sellers studied the statement on their own with the assistance of their real estate agent and the settlement agent the idea was that the more people who reviewed it the more likely it became that errors would be detected don t assume that the closing agent is always correct whether you re dealing with the hud-1 or the closing disclosure mistakes can and do happen and errors can be found at the last minute ask as many questions as necessary to help you understand all charges this line-by-line summary covers the most critical sections of the form and yes there are a lot of lines many entries are tabulated before being brought forward to page 1 in section l or page 2 columns contain charges that are paid from either the borrower s or the seller s funds your closing statement probably won t have entries in all these lines this section deals with the commissions paid to real estate agencies lines 701 and 702 show how the commissions are split between two participating agencies commissions are usually paid from the seller s funds but a buyer s agent who sells for sale by owner home might be paid by their client not the seller the entries on these lines are most often paid from the buyer s funds although sellers might agree to pay specified amounts to help the buyer close in some cases these charges are typically paid by the buyer they re all items which the lender requires but which are not always paid to the lender this section is used to itemize escrow funds collected by the lender from the borrower for such things as hazard insurance and property taxes the number of months charged can vary but there are limits as to how much the lender can collect current charges for the expenses paid by the borrower appear in section 900 the entries on lines 1001 through 1007 are for funds used to start the borrower s escrow account from which the lender will pay next year s premiums each mortgage payment includes an amount that covers a portion of these recurring expenses line 1008 is an escrow adjustment calculated by the settlement agent by comparing different escrow formulas this step is to make sure the lender isn t collecting more escrow funds than are allowed the figure is always zero or a negative number title charges include fees directly related to the transfer of title such as the title examination title search document preparation and fees for the title insurance policy they are normally charged to the buyer legal fees include fees for both the borrower s and seller s attorneys and sometimes for an attorney for the
