I ' m trying to learn Golang. I decided to try to write a simple server - Getting Help - Go Forum In other words, I’ trying to run a simple exemple from Internet. Here is a code: package main import ( “fmt” “log” “net/http” ) func foohandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { fmt.Fprintf(w, “Hello world”) } func main() { http.HandlerFunc("/", foohandler) log.Println(“Listenning…”) http.ListenAndServe(":3000", nil) } When I am running this code I am getting =  > ./comeon.go:14: too many arguments to conversion to http.HandlerFunc: http.HandlerFunc("/", foohandler) What do I wrong? My Golang version is 1.8 http.HandlerFunc("/", foohandler) Hi, change  http.HandlerFunc  to  http.HandleFunc OMG! Thank you very much! Thought that you might like to know the difference, HandleFunc(path, funcHandler) registers a path with default serve mux or specific serve mux if used on an instance variable. HandlerFunc(funcDesired) returns a function that conforms to the Handler interface given a function that doesn’t.  It’s a way to use generic functions as handlers.
