opportunity to chat with mr. jones we spoke about his many adventures and i was left with a feeling of pride having had the opportunity to spend an hour living vicariously through his stories and getting to know this amazing man and his life s work jones life hasn t always been the charmed existence it is now he was adopted by his aunt and uncle when his parent s divorced and grew up in machynlleth in wales russell dickson what does photography mean to you cambridge jones right now it is money but in the old days i had a really bad memory i was actually adopted when i was a child and i had a very traumatic first few years i think one of the ways i dealt with early life without my real mother or father was to sort of erase memory that was my safety valve and it allowed me to live in the present and to get on with my life and i think it has been a very successful trick for me it has given me a very happy and stable life at first it meant capturing things now it means money and a comfortable lifestyle rd so would you say photography has been therapeutic for you cj i like photography because it is about time and not wanting to lose things which is a part of being adopted and losing parents photography was a tool in which i could capture time and not lose it the problem with that is over time you end up with a lot of photo albums so i learned to be selective about the pictures i take rd what is your favorite camera cj my go-to camera is a canon 5d for all things inside and out it is small enough to wield anywhere and brilliant quality i have also been shooting film on it in nashville india rd what do you prefer color or black and white cj i was very heavily black and white for the first 10 years of my career and i still lean that way the oddity of digital cameras is you don t have to make that decision in advance anymore i can go out and do a shoot with al pacino and decide later rd would you say that a color picture is harder to take cj most photographers don t handle color well because you have to consider all the colors in their environment so it becomes easier to go black and white rd what is the one thing you wish you knew when you started out in photography cj the one thing i wish someone had told me before i started in photography was move to russia america or paris they actually love respect photography as much as i do whereas the uk has something of a distant and commercial relationship to it it is a functional science rather than an art to most brits rd you are best known for you celebrity photography what it is like working with celebs cj the great thing about my career is the number of actors that come back and say that it is the best photo that anyone has ever taken of them they don t mean it is the best photo that reflects their films but it is the best photo that reflects them as a person rd how do you get celebrities to do want you want at a shoot cj i gave up trying to go in with preconceived notions some time ago one example of what i am talking about was a shoot i did with andrew lincoln and bill nighy they had the idea in advance of the shoot that they wanted to be a particular comedy group from a british television series morecambe and wise the actors in the show would always been seen in strange pajamas in bed having a conversation it was a weird thing happening back in the 60 s and 70 s on english tv we spent two hours trying to get the shot it was all forced with lots of people getting involved it was the last time i did things that way from then on i just worked with the person in a room and went with whatever mood catches us eventually we found this little motorbike and bill jumped on it and i thought that is it that s the shot we want rd can you tell me about some of the celebs you have worked with cj the oddity of celeb portraiture is you have this strange access to places and things i was driving in wales one time and i got a call from robert plant and we got together for a shoot i did a shoot with johnny cash s son next to a barn in a middle of a field al pacino is one when i arrived i didn t have any plan i tried using studio light but it didn t look right so we went out into the garden and i noticed he had these wonderful tiles by his pool house and that is where we did the shoot the first time i shot anthony hopkins was on malibu beach california i was panicked and sweating because he hadn t arrived yet and none of my new british lights that i took with me all the way to la would work because i had completely forgotten u.s. electrical outlets are different mr. hopkins came in and was brilliant and said i like natural light don t you and i said yes and we did the whole shoot out in his garden rd what is it like working with the royals cj charles and his mother the queen are what royalty have historically been they are incredibly interesting because of this they don t expect to have to be anything but themselves their status comes from within they are not trying to be charming or funny they are regal mentally more distant that s royalty what is interesting about princess diana s children william and harry is they are of a different generation and are more in touch with what it means to be a modern celebrity i did some work with them and charles for charity rd what work specifically have you done with the royals cj the queen was visiting my old college one day having lunch with the dean and i happened to be finishing up shooting a book on the college when the dean came up to me and said oh i have a rather special guest coming would you be interested in doing a portrait i thought wow that was a complete piece of luck i also worked with prince charles he was easy and charming to photograph because he is who he is he wanted me to do something for his charity titled the princes trust it was similar to my original project in the book you see portraits of people like sharon osbourne and a song that helped them get through a tough time in their life it sold in starbucks all over the u.k i also did some work for tony blair i do his christmas card every year rd how do you stay cool in these situations dealing with celebs and royals cj the object is to get them to relax because like everyone else they don t want my camera pointed at them i don t have space to get nervous or intimidated or even star struck i have to get anthony hopkins or robert plant comfortable enough to be photographed if i were having tea with them i would get nervous so because i am there to work i don t even think about getting nervous rd what projects are you currently working on and are excited about cj i enjoyed working on this film called subconscious i play the commander of a submarine in it i am classically trained as an actor but i do not consider myself to be a professional actor so i don t have to worry about getting my next film it made the job so much easier for me i am working on a project about manuel cuevas a legendary fashion designer his projects have included creating the man in black image for johnny cash dressing icons like bob dylan mick jagger the lone ranger the beatles sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band album cover elvis and glen campbell the infamous rhinestone cowboy suit as well as the outfit he wore during his last-ever appearance at carnegie hall rd are there any projects that you wanted to work on that didn t work out cj i got a nice letter from nelson mandela who wanted me to do a portrait of him with bill clinton for a charity of course he is not well so until my dying day that will be my biggest tragedy not getting to do it i think that might have been the one project when i would have gotten fluttered up you can see the work of cambridge
