The settlement, filed in a federal court in California on Wednesday, will result in a $1.1 billion pretax charge to earnings this quarter, Toyota said. Owners of some 16 million Toyota, Lexus and Scion vehicles would be eligible for payments and safety updates that would vary depending on their vehicle and its age.  The settlement includes no admission of fault or unlawful conduct by Toyota and allows the company to avoid the risks associated with battling a lengthy trial.  " One of our overriding goals has been to vigorously defend the safety of our vehicles, and we believe we have done that, "  said       Mike Michels,        a Toyota spokesman. The 2009/2010 recalls and public scrutiny of accidents involving its vehicles—including congressional hearings—dented Toyota's reputation for quality and undermined its sales. Its U.S. sales were flat in 2010, a year in which almost every other major auto maker posted gains, and ended its 30-year unbroken run of market-share increases in the U.S.  The settlement is one of the largest in a lawsuit involving the automotive industry, said       Steve W. Berman,        one of the lead plaintiff lawyers. The tentative agreement must still be approved by U.S. District Judge       James Selna.        Toyota's costs related to the recalls and probes are likely to exceed $3.1 billion. Toyota estimated in 2010 that the costs of recalls and lost sales world-wide would be around $2 billion, a figure that didn't include the latest settlement, its legal fees, fines from the U.S. government and additional floor-mat recalls that came afterward. Toyota declined to disclose a total cost. A U.S. government probe of unintended acceleration in accidents involving Toyotas absolved the throttle-control electronics in the vehicles. It found that driver error was to blame for most of the mishaps with sticky accelerator pedals and floor mats playing a role in others.  Toyota continues to face two separate lawsuits related to the 2009-10 recalls, a consumer-protection and fraud suit in Orange County, Calif., and an unfair-business-practice case brought by the attorneys general of 28 states, a person familiar with the matter said.  The class-action lawsuit alleges that a flaw in Toyota's electronic throttle-control system—and not ill-fitting floor mats and sticky accelerator pedals—were causing Toyota drivers to accelerate out of control and crash. Mr. Berman is valuing the settlement at up to $1.4 billion, an estimate that assumes the maximum recovery and costs for repairs and equipment. Mr. Berman said the settlement would include cash payments for loss of residual value capped at $250 million to Toyota owners who sold or traded in their vehicles between Sept. 1, 2009, and Dec. 31, 2010; $250 million in payments for car owners whose vehicles cannot be updated with brake-override systems up to a maximum of $125 apiece; between $200 million and $400 million to install brake-override systems on up to 3.25 million vehicles; $400 million for extending warranties for engine-control modules and other components; and about $227 million in attorneys' fees and costs. The court must set plaintiff attorneys' fees and approve costs.  Toyota recalled in 2009 and 2010 more than 5.3 million vehicles in the U.S. alone for problems related to ill-fitting floor mats and 2.77 million vehicles for accelerator pedals that could stick. It has been fined more than $66 million by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for not notifying the agency in a timely manner of problems. Two weeks ago, the agency fined Toyota $17.4 million for not telling the agency about floor-mat issues in a separate recall of its Lexus RX 350. Toyota's issues with floor mats came to light in 2009 when an off-duty California highway patrolman in a dealer-loaned Lexus ES 350 sped out of control and crashed, killing himself and three passengers. For months, lawyers and some safety advocates argued that Toyota's unintended acceleration problems were caused by defects with its electronic throttle control system. Initially supporting their claims were data collected by government agencies that showed unintended acceleration events occurred more frequently in Toyotas than any other brand as well as firsthand accounts from drivers who claimed to have acceleration problems that weren't related to the two recalls.  The scandal led company Chief Executive       Akio Toyoda       to apologize in testimony before Congress and vow that the company would overhaul the way it handled quality control.  Mr. Berman, a partner in Hagens Berman LLP in Seattle, said the settlement accomplishes several of the suit's objectives, including getting more safety equipment installed on Toyota vehicles. But it didn't prove there still are flaws in Toyota's throttle-control system. " We have not resolved the issue of is there a bug "  in the system, he said. Although Toyota is steadfast that there were no other problems than those that were covered by recalls, the settlement includes extended warranties on vehicles' engine-control modules, cruise-control switches, accelerator pedal assemblies, stop-lamp switches and throttle body assemblies. Toyota maintains there are no problems with these parts. Toyota officials felt that the company had proven that its vehicles were safe and that it had recovered enough from the scandal to settle the case without harming its image, a person familiar with the matter said. Toyota's U.S. sales were up 29% through November this year over a year earlier and it has gained 2 points of market share. Globally, Toyota may also regain its top spot in sales.
