this video on www.youtube.com or enable javascript if it is disabled in your browser this video is mostly carson singing into a microphone looking up or standing in front of a window there s not much you can really do with a song that s so repetitive but carson does what he can and the video has more than 200,000 views i d be lying if i said i haven t watched this video more than a dozen times since it came out over two years ago it s an actual music video with a whole backstory and a girl victoria baxter acting alongside carson also can we talk about how he s dressed he has grown up well since the days of the random headband freddy marschall who edited someone like you directed this video as well there s so much emotion in this video that swift should be jealous it s so good p.s hand-walking motions are a must-have but how can anything beat that cover if you re asking yourself this question please stand by there is a reasoning behind my madness talk dirty has more than a million views and is carson s most recent cover video even though it was posted more than a year ago this is probably my favorite cover of his and honestly one of the most well-filmed videos for his covers thank you again marschall if you recall from carson s call me maybe video he was on by a couch and standing in front of a window he does the same thing here even though there s a sheet over the couch i have no idea if it s the same location but i find it very interesting also someone is in love with their black blazer because he wore it in the call me maybe video and in this one speaking of fashion even the nerd outfit is excellentâ€”and carson surprises everyone by playing the saxophone not only in his normal attire but also in his nerd outfit cody carson 147k subscribers subscribe

great did you mess up the list probably but keep scrolling you re probably thinking this is the most random video out of carson s covers it s more than seven years old he looks like a child it s before he got his lip pierced and the quality is terrible all valid points but this is why i strongly believe this cover is no 1 he actually got to sing this song with all time low after covering it here s the timeline carson posted this cover in january of 2008 he then posted a video asking alex gaskarth if he could sing coffee shop soundtrack with them in cleveland gaskarth responded and carson posted a video freaking out about it in april in may carson lived his dream and sang onstage with all time low another reason why this cover is no 1 is the fact that set it off is currently on tour with all time low which has made this story come full circle cody carson 147k subscribers subscribe all time low coffee shop soundtrack cover info shopping tap to unmute if playback doesn t begin
