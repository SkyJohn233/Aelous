we are happy to consider your baby for possible use on our billboards or ads however we are under specific regulations regarding the use of baby photos the following requirements must be met in order for us to consider using a submitted photo the baby must be a child of donors to prolife across america this is a small thank you to those who help make this life-saving outreach possible all photos must be taken professionally snapshots are too difficult for billboard presentation no dark backgrounds or anything too busy in color all photos must have a photo release from the photographer and the permission of both parents advertisers are very strict about copyright infringement and we must comply the parents of the baby must be in a heterosexual marriage as stated in our mission statement we base our beliefs on biblical principles and roman catholic teaching hence we believe that god created marriage to be exclusively the union of one man and one woman and that intimate sexual activity is to occur exclusively within that union all photos should be of infants nine months or younger not toddlers or older children printed copies of the photos must be submitted and should be sent in duplicate 3 5 or 4 6 if you have a disc or digital files of the photos it may be needed later if the photo is chosen to be used but printed copies must be initially submitted all photos that meet these guidelines will be saved for possible use later in a billboard display on a mini billboard or for our brochures and mailings there is currently a one- to two-year wait list for submitted baby photos to be used i d like to host a youth fundraiser what should i do in the past we ve had many different types of youth fundraisers here are a couple ideas you could consider 1 bake sale works best to hold it at the school on an open house or parents visit day or at church after mass 2 car wash 3 baby bottle fundraiser kids bring home the bottle and put spare change/dollars inside for a week have grades compete against each other -or boys vs girls bottles might even be donated if they request from wal mart target or local store 4 corn on the cob pumpkin squash sale in rural areas to local churches on sunday after services 5 carnival- games prizes 6 pancakes for life- kids host a breakfast event 7 bagging groceries at a local supermarket and raise funds through tips these are just a few ideas it can also be fun to let your class/group vote or come up with additional ideas after the event we are happy to send fact cards for all the kids pens and a video you could share as our thank you contact us with additional questions or help support this life-saving mission our organization is committed to bringing positive persuasive pro-life message to help foster a culture of life we have found that people respond very well to smiling and sleeping babies with positive and educational facts our simple messages have helped change the hearts of fathers friends and grandparents and also help a women in need comfortable with calling our confidential 800 helpline in addition we are unable to use words like abortion killing etc or any graphic images because of billboard newspaper

are able for our mission that we are able to continue to promote life via the media
