sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation of the spleen in a four-year-old with anemia sciencedirect sciencedirect sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation sant of the spleen first reported as a distinct histopathological entity in 2004 is exceedingly rare in children the clinical progression and pathophysiologic features of this disease are poorly described in the literature we performed a literature review of reported cases of sant out of 258 reported cases only five were in children we present a sixth case of sant in a four-year-old boy who presented with chronic anemia and elevated inflammatory markers the relative variability in case presentation and the clinical concern for malignancy warrant further disease characterization and discussion of management sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation erythrocyte sedimentation rate ultrasound computed tomography not available lactate dehydrogenase fluoro-2-deoxy- d -glucose positron emission tomography sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation sant is a rare benign vascular lesion of the spleen it was first reported by martel et al in 2004 as a distinct histopathological entity with a series of 25 patients 1 most cases are incidentally detected on imaging and frequently present with vague abdominal pain 2 sant can be associated with a variety of unrelated coexisting conditions including metachronous or synchronous malignant tumors or hematological conditions including polyclonal gammopathy and myelodysplastic syndrome 3 4 5 a four-year-old male presented with unexplained recurrent vomiting he was initially diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia and was treated with iron supplements due to persistent microcytic anemia with positive fecal occult blood he underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy which revealed only mild esophagitis a year later persistent anemia was noted despite good adherence to oral iron supplements labs were notable for a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and an elevated c-reactive protein level an abdominal ultrasound us was obtained which revealed a mass in the spleen fig 1 a b fig 1 a a longitudinal view of the spleen and hilar mass on abdominal ultrasound with

tomography scan ct which revealed a well-circumscribed 5.9 cm solid heterogeneous splenic mass with a densely calcified wall and minimal enhancement after intravenous contrast fig 1 c four weeks after splenic vaccinations the patient underwent an uneventful single-port laparoscopic splenectomy pathology examination demonstrated a 184 g 11.0 × 6.8 × 5.6 cm intact spleen containing a 6.0 × 5.3 × 4.8 cm well-circumscribed mass fig 1 d with morphological and immunophenotypic features consistent with sant fig 1 e-i the patient had an unremarkable recovery and was started on a prophylactic daily dose of oral penicillin he was discharged with continued hematology follow-up splenic masses can be divided into primary and secondary neoplasms primary splenic neoplasms are further subdivided into lymphoid and non-lymphoid/vascular neoplasms arising from the white and red pulp respectively primary benign vascular tumors include hemangiomas lymphangiomas and hamartomas littoral cell angioma hemangioendothelioma and hemangiopericytoma have an intermediate malignant potential whereas angiosarcomas are malignant 6 7 the commonest benign neoplasms of the spleen are hemangiomas however sant of the spleen is a rare benign vascular lesion arising within the red pulp of the spleen it was previously described by multiple names such as splenic hamartoma and multinodular hemangioma 2 most case reports describe it as a solitary mass but there are descriptions of multifocal lesions 3 8 since its first description in the literature in 2004 there have been a total of 258 reported cases with only five in children table 1 we report the sixth case of pediatric sant in a four-year-old boy who presented with chronic anemia and elevated inflammatory markers table 1 reported cases of sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation of the spleen—sant in children esr erythrocyte sedimentation rate ldh lactate dehydrogenase ct computed tomography n/a not available the exact etiology of sant remains unclear various theories have been postulated including de novo development arising from an ebstein-barr virus infection 9 10 occurring in the context of igg4-associated disease 3 11 or representing the final common morphologic evolution of a variety of benign splenic conditions including inflammatory pseudotumor and hamartoma 4 12 some authors suggest that sant develops secondary to vascular obstruction from venous congestion anoxia and its local metabolic effects 1 the granulation tissue formation and fibrin deposition seen in sant can be produced in response to endothelial damage 1 8 a common manifestation among pediatric cases is the presence of elevated inflammatory markers 6 13 although the exact etiology of sant has not been elucidated several authors suggest that at least a subset of patients can develop the lesion through an immune-mediated process which correlates with the histological findings of inflammatory cell infiltration including lymphocytes and igg4+ plasma cells 3 6 and is consistent with the theory that sant and inflammatory pseudotumor may represent a continuum 8 10 12 14 given the description of cases from pediatric patients whose follow-up has shown a rapid mass progression it is possible that pediatric sant corresponds to a more aggressive variant of the disease 6 12 it is not possible to reliably differentiate sant from other benign and malignant splenic lesions based on imaging alone 15 us can show an iso- or hypoechoic heterogeneous mass with a hypervascular rim and vessels within the central portion of the tumor 16 whereas ct imaging frequently describes a low-density single mass that displaces the normal parenchyma with a vascularized edge with or without calcifications 8 11 16 17 on intravenous contrast-enhanced ct sant appears heterogeneous but has a well-demarcated border fig 1 18 sant of the spleen can present as a hypermetabolic lesion on the fluoro-2-deoxy- d -glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography fdg-pet ct scans raising the concern for malignancy 4 19 the elevated standardized fdg uptake value compared to hepatic and surrounding normal splenic uptake in some cases of sant could be related to the inflammatory activity degree of the process 17 microscopically sant of the spleen is composed of multiple vascular nodules in slit-like vascular/angiomatoid spaces with interstitial hemorrhage surrounded by fibrous stroma lack of tissue necrosis is a characteristic finding 1 3 4 the degree of contour demarcation of nodules by collagen and the amount of the intervening stroma is variable 5 sant is similar to a splenic hemangioma although sant is a mixture of three types of blood vessels splenic hemangioma consists only of sinusoids the immunophenotype of the endothelial cells within the angiomatoid nodules exhibit three distinct patterns of cd34 cd31 and cd8 expression cord capillaries cd34+/cd8-/cd31+ sinusoids cd34-/cd8+/cd31+ and small veins cd34-/cd8-/cd31+ recapitulating the composition of the normal splenic red pulp 1 3 asymptomatic patients with benign vascular splenic lesions can be treated conservatively considering that sant is benign with no reports of malignant transformation it could be followed non-surgically however a definitive diagnosis can only be achieved with splenectomy which is favored particularly when encountering a large bulging splenic lesion below the capsular surface raising concerns for malignancy and the potential for splenic rupture non-surgical follow-up has been reported for benign splenic masses with suspected sant that later progressed in size or demonstrated fdg uptake on the fdg-pet ct scan leading to splenectomy 6 14 15 20 most reports of sant have reached the diagnosis through histopathological study after splenectomy however some authors have published partial splenectomy as a method for histological diagnosis 9 12 percutaneous core biopsy has also been reported to making the diagnosis of sant 14 16 and seems safer than it has been classically considered 7 20 with a reported hemorrhagic complication rate of 0–2 7 in our case splenectomy was performed safely by single-port laparoscopy through a quadport olympus center valley pa with the specimen extracted through the same periumbilical incision intact considering the possibility of malignancy it is advisable to resect the complete specimen intact sant of the spleen is a benign vascular lesion that has been previously described under different terms more than three decades ago 8 and has recently been characterized as a distinct entity with a characteristic morphological and immunohistochemical profile the exact pathogenesis and etiology of sant remain uncertain imaging does not reliably differentiate sant from other benign or malignant splenic lesions and is an fdg-avid lesion the diagnosis of sant of the spleen may be established by percutaneous biopsy in adults a procedure increasingly performed in children 20 but it is fraught with potential complications in the presence of a large vascular splenic lesion to date there are no reports of sant biopsy in children considering the limited literature of sant in pediatric population and the possibility that it could present a more aggressive course compared to adults our recommendation whenever possible is to perform a splenectomy the st. jude irb regards such limited case report preparation as an educational activity and thus it is permissible under the privacy rule as a part of health care operations
