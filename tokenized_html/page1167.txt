instructions to replace the loudspeaker let me know if you have any questions please remember to click accept so i receive credit for my help hi there so i got the center grille out but i am stuck on removing the center speaker it is held by two clips or pins and i can not remove them you have to carefully bend the catch lugs away to unclip the speaker where do i force them to left right i just dont want to breake them as i dont think there is replacement parts for it.. i understand what you mean my recollection it that they just hook over the lip of the speaker and just pry away hm ok ill try that carefully ill try lol not sure on what tool to use but i am being patient i just looked at one i have in the shop it looks very simple just use your finger to pry one tab away at a time and lift the speaker out finger maybe the one you see there is different yes there are just 4 tabs clipping the speaker to the cover can you send a picture of what you have yup just a min ok click on the paper clip to insert a picture then click on the little icon at the end of the image url field in the pop up box then click on browse in the next pop up box then select the picture off your computer and click ok then wait for it to fill the image url field in the first box then click insert it did n't come through did you see my instructions ok got it srry just at work now ok yours is different the two lock washers need to come off you need to be very careful and try walking them up the peg little by little with a side to side rocking motion from under the washer if you can pry the center of the washer away from the peg it will help i have to leave soon to drive home let me know if you need more help with it by the way it is better to destroy the washer rather than break the peg if you can bend the center open enough to loosen the washer or cut the washer with a cutting pliers that would be fine you can always get replacement washers the mercedes part number is 000 994 96 45 marty
