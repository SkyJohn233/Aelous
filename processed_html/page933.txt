Camp HOPE: A free weekend camp for grieving children in central WI 2020 Camp Weekends May 16-17, 2020 Camp HOPE is a free weekend camp for grieving children, teenagers and their families. ​ From the moment they arrive, the children and teenagers learn that it is okay to laugh and play and that to do so is not disrespectful to the memory of the person who died. That fun and positive energy comes through in everything we do - starting with our counselors, to our on-site nurse to our kitchen staff. And since everyone who is at camp knows what it’s like to lose someone they love, there is also plenty of space for sharing and the acceptance of tears. Through playing, sharing, and being together in a camp setting with peers and staff who know the pain, the children and teenagers realize that the emotions they are feeling are a normal part of grief. What is happening to them happens to others everywhere, and at Camp HOPE, their pain is understood and shared. THANK YOU… Thank you so much, from the bottom of our hearts to all of our generous donors.  Continued support and giving from friends like you, help support Camp HOPE's mission to provide grieving children and their families a free camp experience, services and resources to help them work through the grieving process.
