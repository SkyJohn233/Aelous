commenting in r/nfl during this debacle in many of the threads i ve seen kc fans were among those advocating for the harshest punishment i m not endorsing this decision or looking to debate i just want to note that the reaction has been better than most other scandals that i can remember making a conscious decision to do the moral thing regardless of on-field ramifications is always hard –

months ago 47 children difference between the hill and hunt situation is that hill s incident happened while he was still in college and had already served what the court determined necessary he dropped in the draft but chiefs did their homework and decided he was worth the risk he is now engaged to the woman he hit and by all accounts is a good father to the kid she was pregnant with at the time this all happened before he ever got a chance in the nfl and it cost him millions he would have gone a lot higher in the draft he has had zero issues since entering the league and is always vocal about being thankful the chiefs gave him a chance hunt had two incidents while being a part of the team and most likely lied about the severity of what happened chiefs can win without hunt and this is the right move for the team this would be a pr disaster at the worst time had chiefs not cut him he is a great talent but this is mahomes team and we have good rb depth best wishes to hunt i don t think he is a shitty human he just seems to have made a shitty decision that cost him his career most likely – falcons stepturkey 916 points 917 points 918 points 5 months ago 202 children how hard is
