central retinal vein occlusion in a patient with igg lambda monoclonal gammopathy allergy and clinical immunology jama ophthalmology jama network customize your jama network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below a 74-year-old man had sudden painless decreased vision in the right eye visual acuity was 20/400 od and 20/20 os intraocular pressure in both eyes showed no abnormalities the patient was aphakic in both eyes after bilateral intracapsular cataract extraction findings from a dilated funduscopic examination revealed a right central retinal vein occlusion crvo a vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye figure 1 and the absence of dilated sausage-shaped retinal veins suggestive of coagulopathy the patient 's ophthalmic history was negative for hypertension diabetes mellitus or atherosclerotic disease but positive for fevers weight loss and night sweats which prompted further assessment laboratory test results were as follows an elevated westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate 126 mm/h reference range 0-35 mm/h hemoglobin 127 g/l reference range 140-175 g/l hematocrit 0.04 reference range 0.41-0.50 total protein 86 g/l reference range 62-82 g/l and albumin 31 g/l reference range 30-50 g/l serum viscosity was elevated at 3.4 centistokes reference range 1.4-2.2 centistokes serum protein electrophoresis revealed an increased igg fraction of 46.7 g/l reference range 8.0-18.0 and a lambda λ light chain of 2820 mg/dl reference range 304-755 mg/dl figure 2 λ light chains were elevated in the urine figure 3 a whole-body computed tomographic scan showed prevascular and paratracheal adenopathy figure 4 bone marrow aspiration and biopsy results figure 5 and figure 6 were consistent with a well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma the diagnosis of low-grade lymphoma with a secondary monoclonal gammopathy was made and the patient was prescribed combined therapy of chlorambucil and prednisone fluorescein angiography shows markedly dilated veins with preretinal and intraretinal hemorrhages serum protein electrophoresis demonstrates 2 restricted bands in the middle gamma and distal gamma region serum immunofixation demonstrates elevated igg λ and λ-free light chains arrows indicate bands showing abnormalities urine protein electrophoresis shows restricted bands urine immunofixation demonstrates lambda-free light chains arrow indicates bands showing abnormalities a computed tomographic scan of the chest demonstrates abnormal adenopathy in the paratracheal and paracardial regions often associated with lymphoma bone marrow biopsy specimen shows 1 of several paratrabecular lymphoid aggregates with occasional irregular nuclei and a few marrow elements with no abnormalities hematoxylin-eosin original magnification ×10 bone marrow biopsy specimen reveals a lymphoid aggregate predominantly of lymphoid cells with irregular nuclei and moderate cytoplasm this bone marrow is consistent with a low-grade lymphoma and bone marrow involvement hematoxylin-eosin original magnification ×40 in most forms of crvo the thrombosis of the central retinal vein occurs at and is posterior to the lamina cribosa where the central retinal artery and vein share an adventitial sheath and the venous circulation has a high resistance to flow the artherosclerotic central retinal artery impinges on the central retinal vein causing turbulence endothelial damage and thrombus formation 1 the association with atherosclerosis makes crvo a common cause of ocular morbidity in the elderly central retinal vein occlusion may also be associated with less common systemic diseases that alter blood viscosity clotting mechanisms or vessel walls 2 4 these include blood dyscrasias eg polycythemia vera dysproteinemias eg waldenström macroglobulinemia causes of vasculitis eg sarcoidosis and hyperviscosity states table 1 the patient 's underlying lymphoma and monoclonal gammopathy caused high serum viscosity increased macromolecular components of plasma igg heavy-chain and λ-light chain hypergammopathy and increased red blood cell aggregation 4 since this is consistent with the virchow triad of thrombosis formation 5 it is likely that the underlying systemic disorder is the cause of our patient 's crvo to our knowledge igg λ subclass gammopathy and crvo have not been previously reported a primary care physician should be involved in basic assessment for associated underlying diseases but a unilateral crvo in an elderly adult does not need an extensive medical workup if the history and results of physical examination and basic laboratory assessment are negative in this case the fever weight loss and night sweats prompted further investigation corresponding author robert w. enzenauer md mph department
