Safeway to close store in Waipahu - Pacific Business News Safeway will close its Waipahu store at the end of the month, according to General Manager John Obery.  Obery, who oversees Hawaii operations, says this is the only Hawaii store the chain has closed in nearly 40 years of doing business here.  "We reviewed all options and the decision that was made was made," says Obery.  In recent years a slew of businesses have closed in Waipahu, including Arakawas, Big Way Supermarket, Sak ' Save and the Flamingo restaurant. Other Waipahu retailers have had to refocus their businesses, including Waipahu Bicycle  &  Sporting Goods, which has eliminated the bicycle portion of its business, and Pizza Hut, which has closed its dine-in restaurant.  Over the past decade, Safeway, along with other retailers in the beleaguered district, has dealt with fierce competition from big-box retailers and new shopping center outlets that have sprung up in outlying areas.  Ironically, just four years ago Safeway claimed Hawaii's market was big enough for any company that could live up to the challenge of increased competition from conventional as well as club discount stores.  Safeway officials would not discuss the reasons behind closing the store, but analysts speculate it just wasn't able to compete.  "At a certain point something has to give," says Marty Plotnick, president of retail research firm Creative Resources Inc. "And what has to give is the entrenched retailer who cannot compete."  "I am absolutely sure that they [Safeway] thought long and hard about this," says Sam Shenkus, of Sam Shenkus Marketing. "I would venture to say they have taken months to finally say, `Stop the bleeding.' "  Hawaii is a finite market with a fixed population, says Plotnick. Arakawas, along with other Waipahu plantation stores, made at least two generations of owners successful because of the lack of mobility of the local populace, says Plotnick. "Today, everybody has mobility."  However, at least one Waipahu retailer seems to be thriving. Beginning Dec. 1, Daiei Waipahu will be open 24 hours a day, a move observers say is directly related to Safeway's departure.  "Daiei is a very good retailer at adapting to the local market that they are in," says Shenkus. "Because they are more regionalized, they can offer the Waipahu customer a more tailored inventory to their needs."  In response to the challenge of big boxes and warehouse clubs, supermarkets have created loyalty programs. Yet Daiei made the decision not to have a loyalty program, but to instead focus on day in and day out better value, says Shenkus.  "I think that could be why they are doing well in Waipahu," she says.  "I really would suggest that supermarkets who have loyalty courtesy programs go shop at Costco," Plotnick advises. "I've never met a Costco employee who wasn't friendly, who didn't know where the item was, who wasn't sympathetic when I didn't have my checkbook at the counter.  "The point I'm making is, don't think because you have a loyalty courtesy card you've come up with something new to compete with."  Hawaii Venture Group LLC CEO Randy Havre says Safeway's new Kapolei store might have taken business away from the Waipahu branch.  "They have stores that are in growth areas," Havre says. "They are just giving up Waipahu."  Newly elected City Councilman Gary Okino, who represents the district, has questioned the feasibility of approving new shopping centers in the Leeward area when existing businesses are struggling to survive.  All 73 Safeway Waipahu employees will be offered jobs at other Safeways. With 19 stores in Hawaii, the company has spent over $35 million on remodeling here in the last four years.  "We are still committed to the state and we are committed to the community and Hawaii," says Safeway's Obery. "We are here for the long haul and we see growth."
