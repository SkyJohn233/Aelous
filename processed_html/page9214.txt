About   Space Archaeology Menu Close August 18, 2014  2:46 am Dear Stephen, I see that you reviewed the book Plaza before. I have written a book that is similar to that. Would you be willing to let me provide you with a copy of the book in hopes that you would consider reviewing my book as well? My name is Michael Brown and the book I want to send is titled The Consecration of Jacob Jordaens. You can find a link to it here:   http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HW1NDP4 I can provide it to you as a digital file (.mobi, .epub, or PDF). Of course, I understand that you are under zero obligation to review my book, and if you do review it, you can leave a good, or a bad review. I am simply looking for the opportunity to have you consider it. Thank you. I look forward to your response. Cordially, Michael J Brown January 10, 2016  10:41 am is there any works about GOBEKLI TEPE in Turkey ? October 21, 2016  4:10 am That s a mokdrb-ealer. Great thinking! March 11, 2018  5:19 am Please help. I read a book long ago in the 1970 s or 80 s, the main character was a female space archaeologist whose father was also a famous archaeologist. She is called in to help safely explore a derelict spaceship recently discovered. They go from room to room in this huge empty ship to see if they can discover any information about the former non-humanoid occupants. It is not  Sphere  or  Rendezvous with Rama  or  Hyperion  I have also read those. I think it was a novel but it may have been a short story. Hope you can help me. March 11, 2018  10:31 am You might be thinking of ‘The Architects of Hyperspace’. I think it had the father daughter storyline  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0380751445?ie=UTF8 & tag=spacearchaeology-20 Your email address will not be published.
