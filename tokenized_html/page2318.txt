pumping and dumping of altcoins a crypto world scam ifticrypto have you ever heard of pumping and dumping of altcoins or cryptocurrencies well it s quite common in crypto-industry in this article i will be explaining various things related to altcoin pumping and dumping along with that i will also explain why you should stay away from such altcoin pump and dump schemes and groups contents show first of all once again all cryptocurrencies apart from bitcoin are called altcoins there are hundreds of coins available in the market many of them are not even available in big exchanges like bittrex binance etc since there are 100s of coins many of them are exploited easily so what is altcoin pump and dump pumping and dumping is basically a method by which a group of people starts buying pumping an altcoin in large number such that its price increases by a huge margin and later start selling the coin as soon as it reaches a high price this way the price starts falling back down to where it was dumping let me put all this in detail suppose i want to pump an altcoin abc which is priced at 0.1 to do that i will first accumulate a huge number of abc coins that means i will buy a huge number of abc coins now to pump it i will spread a fake news about abc coin in a way that everyone starts buying it i can spread the news on facebook whatsapp telegram groups and other social media channels usually there are dedicated pumping groups where the members are told about the coin name and they all start buying together that s called pumping if everyone members of the group or people to whom the fake news is spread is buying it and no one is selling it the prices of abc coin will start increasing rapidly more and more people even regular traders and newbies start seeing abc coin rising and they also start buying it thinking that it will rise even more now let s suppose the price of abc coin reaches 0.8 in 1 minute since the price is increased i and other pump group members will start selling the coin to book profits because we know that the prices are being pumped and are not naturally increased this is called dumping of a coin since the majority hold of that coin was with pump group members the price will start falling down as soon as the group members start selling it after everyone sells their coin the prices reach back to where it was initially 0.1 in many cases the price may even reach under the initial rate this way the group of people who entered when the price was low will make huge profits while those who bought later thinking that the coin was naturally increasing will lose a huge amount of money i hope you understood the process that s basically how this thing works usually there are various dedicated pump and dump groups with 1000s of members who take part in pump and dump and that s how it works out these groups can easily pump a small coin by 1000-1500 within few seconds as i said these pumps are organized by dedicated groups here s a snap of a telegram group the group name is hidden on purpose anyways this way they send out messages before the pump the snap shows a group of 4300 members it is good enough to pump a small coin as you can see they announced tab coin to get pumped tab is a very small coin with a very small volume so it was easy for them to pump it with the help of 1000 members the next snapshot shows the price of tab coin when the pumped it the coin was at around 0.00000499 btc and they pumped it all the way up to 0.00002950 btc if you do the maths that s around 600 increase within minutes the people who entered late lost all the money while only a few members along with the group owners make the most of money that s how it works there are tons of examples but i don t think it is important to share my aim was to just let you know about pumping and dumping with some real stats now the question is is it legal no it is not illegal in fact nothing is illegal in crypto but wait it s unethical
