insights into k-ras 4b regulation by post-translational lysine acetylation knyphausen p lang f baldus l extra a lammers m. ras is a molecular switch cycling between an active gtp-bound and an inactive gdp-bound state mutations in ras mostly affecting the off-switch are found in many human tumours recently it has been shown that k-ras 4b is targeted bylysine acetylation at k104 based on results obtained for an acetylation mimetic ras mutant k104q it was hypothesised that k104-acetylation might interferewith its oncogenicity by impairing sos-catalysed guanine-nucleotide exchange we prepared site-specifically k104-acetylated k-ras 4b and the correspondingoncogenic mutant protein g12v using the genetic-code expansion concept we found that sos-catalysed nucleotide exchange also of allosterically activated sos wasneither affected by acetylation of k104 in wildtype k-ras 4b nor in the g12vmutant suggesting that glutamine is a poor mimetic for acetylation at this site.in vitro the lysine-acetyltransferases cbp and p300 were able to acetylate both wildtype and g12v k-ras 4b in addition to k104 we identified further acetylationsites in k-ras 4b including k147 within the important g5/sak-motif however the intrinsic and the sos-catalysed nucleotide exchange was not affected byk147-acetylation of k-ras 4b finally we show that sirt2 and hdac6 do neitherdeacetylate k-ras 4b if acetylated at k104 nor if acetylated at k147 in vitro
