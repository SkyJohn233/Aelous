Cinco De Mayo Block Party at Greenlake  Heaps and heaps of Mexican food, margarita drink specials, and beer are yours for the (over)consumption at this bash at Tacos Guaymas. There's something for those with a competitive nature, too: A jalapeno-eating contest, plus prizes and giveaways. All this joyful spring madness will be accompanied by DJs and live music, including Revolver Rock, Los Volcanoes Lucha Libre League, and Latin Rose.  3.  Cinco de Mayo at El Chupacabra  El Chupacabra's three locations ( Alki ,  Greenwood , and  South Lake Union ) will have tequila, Mexican food and music. Plus, views of the beach (from Alki) and the Space Needle (from South Lake Union). 4.  Cinco de Mayo at Little Water Cantina  Celebrate Cinco de Mayo with Little Water Cantina and KEXP's DJ Chilly, host of the Latin music show "El Sonido." There will be $5 drink specials all day long and an outdoor bar featuring 100% Exotico tequila and Mezcal Amaras. 5.  Cinco de Mayo at Mezcales  Come join Mezcales Bar  &  Grill for its very first Cinco de Mayo fiesta, complete with specials like $4.50 house margaritas, $3 beer, and $1 tacos. 6.  Cinco de Mayo At Mission Cantina  Mission Cantina wants you to "just take Friday off." And with good reason: for Cinco de Mayo, they're offering both brunch and dinner specials (brunch starts at 10 and goes until 4), plus a photo booth, $7 El Jimador margaritas, and $4 Dos Equis drafts. There will also be live music by Mariachi Fiesta Mexicana at night.  7.

Seattle Bachata Festival 2017  Dance slinky bachata and kizomba with expert class leaders and performers, like Ruben Ochoa, Cesar Gueretty, and Eduardo Sanchez of Latin Rhapsody. Though the festival runs all weekend, there's a special tequila tasting on Cinco de Mayo. 9.  Windermere Cut Party  Seattle's "biggest Cinco de Mayo party" (they say) doubles as a celebration of the opening of the Windermere Cup rowing competition. Dance to the Lovejacks and Spike and the Impalers in the beer and margarita garden and enjoy fare from taco trucks.     10.  12th Annual Cinco de Mayo Celebration  Join El Centro for a chance to celebrate Mexican culture and heritage, and also to celebrate its new outdoor stage in the South Entrance with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Other activities will include a tianguis/bazaar, music from Fuerza "M" and Banda Vagos, food for purchase, resource booths, children's activities, storytelling, and more. True to the center's mission of inclusiveness, all attendees are invited to participate in the "Desfile Cultural" parade, in which everyone wears their own traditional dress. The goal is to celebrate "racial diversity and unity in our community."  Get all this and more on the free  Stranger Things To Do mobile app —available now on the  App Store  and  Google Play .
