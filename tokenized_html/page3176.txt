noticed a small obsession with social media scheduling tools and there are a lot of them out there some stand out some don t. social media scheduling has become a must-have if you re using social media to promote your business or other marketing purposes as it helps you save time and boost your results in this blog post i m going to show you how to schedule your social media posts and cover photos with postfity scheduling your social media updates has a lot of benefits and it s not just the obvious one the fact that you can save time by posting or rather scheduling multiple updates at once there is so much more that a scheduling tool can do for you if it s the right choice social media scheduling can help you plus of course you can t always be there to post a new update while it s true that we can always have access or almost always if your phone or internet signals don t fail you to our social profiles we don t always have access to our laptops and desktop computers where we can store media or create it to share on social profiles as to when to use social media scheduling the truth is you can use with most any type of post you can think of except for actual engagement almost any update you post can be scheduled ahead of time the bigger challenge is when you queue posts to be re-shared multiple times that s when you need to check and make sure your updates are still relevant in the past i ve talked plenty of social media scheduling tools now i ve found a new scheduling tool to try out and i m loving it postfity is you ve guessed it a social media scheduling tool that works with multiple social networks most notably twitter facebook instagram linkedin and xing primarily it s a social media scheduling tool however there s much more than meets the eye and one of the coolest features it has is the ability to schedule your facebook cover photos something you don t get with other major scheduling tools but more on that later first let me show you what it can do in terms of social media scheduling getting started with postfity is super easy you can create an account for free and upgrade it later if you prefer or just keep using the free version as long as you want once you ve connected your accounts you can actually organise them into groups to make things easier and more organised depending on your plan you can add dozens even up to 200 social accounts to manage so this feature comes in very handy you can create several groups and easily access them from the left-hand side of your dashboard additionally you can also add different team members to your account to help manage all of your social media to start scheduling simply select all of the accounts you want so you can schedule the same update at the same time across multiple social accounts and social networks and start writing your update as you can see you can also add images from your computer but what s even cooler is that you have access to a built-in photo editor that lets you edit and customize your images or create something from scratch and you can do quite a bit with this editor for example you can automatically optimise the size of the image to fit your preferred social network twitter facebook instagram as well as make simple edits like cropping or rotating your image and adding a background colour plus you can pick a different filter to completely change the look of your image add some text like a call to action for example as well as draw something yourself over it or use a sticker as for watermarking your images you can actually do that automatically in your accounts settings just upload your logo decide where you want the watermark to be positioned in the image and even set it for all of your accounts this way you don t have to manually add your watermark to every single image you want to share or schedule back to posting updates though you have 3 options share something right then and there schedule the update for a later time or you can queue your update to be published automatically by postfity you don t necessarily have to set any particular times for your queue as the tool can still publish them for you and you ll a list of all your upcoming updates in the main dashboard so you can remove or edit them however if you go to your setting you can build your own posting schedule for the queue you can do this for all of your social media accounts individually or add a time slot to all of your accounts at once to help you save time when setting everything up once you re done scheduling or queuing your updates you can check your upcoming posts on the main dashboard either as a list or as a calendar by day week or month as you browse through your list of scheduled updated you can take certain actions for example you can reuse posts or even multiply them the post will then be republished the amount of times you ve specified and as you can see you can also determine the posting frequency so you don t post the same update too many times in a row or too often apart from posting and scheduling your own content postfity also allows you to search for quality content to share with your audience as you can see you can browse through different categories like business science games and arts to find content to share each post also mentions how many shares likes and comments it has so you can tell at a glance how popular it is and therefore also engaging when sharing one of these posts you can customize the update with your own thoughts as well as add your own images and edit them as i showed you earlier and schedule or queue it for later plus you can easily mark posts as favourites to see them all in the same tab and post them or schedule them at a later time one of postfity s really cool features is that you can actually schedule your facebook page s cover photos plus you can schedule the same cover to be posted multiple times this is a very handy feature for businesses for example say you had an offer coming up in a few weeks that you want to advertise across your social networks or a regular event that happens every few weeks or months with this feature you can create all of your cover photos ahead of time and schedule them for the exact date you want them live apart from scheduling and content curation postfity also offers social media analytics simply select what analytics you want to see posts published post likes shares comments or link clicks as well as the time frame preferred to see your social media results from that time plus you can also compare results within the chart so you can see for example both how many likes you got and how many comments shares or total link clicks also in your analytics are archives all of your published posts and covers so that you can take any action you want like reposting them or multiplying them for example it s also worth mentioning that there are a couple more useful apps and tools that you can get to save time while managing your social media i love being pleasantly surprised and postfity has definitely managed to do that not only is it easy to use and with a great interface but it has some really cool scheduling features especially the fact that you can schedule facebook cover photos which isn t exactly a common feature among similar scheduling tools but very useful for business pages especially when it comes
