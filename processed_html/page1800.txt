F1 drivers on coke? Benigno Bartoletti claimed that as many as one third of the field of 20 drivers take the drug as a stimulant before grand prix races. "Honestly, this makes me laugh," Alesi told website GP2005.com.  "When you know that the F1 drivers need all their faculties to control fast cars and push them to the limit, where the least millimetre and a mere thousandth of a second in time can make reactions crucial, one can only laugh at these ludicrous accusations. "Drivers are healthy people and need to be, and would never play with such dangerous products." Bartoletti told Italy's Quattroruote motoring magazine that cocaine could boost a driver's reaction time and feeling of invincibility for about 90 minutes, but that it could become dangerous if a race went longer. Alesi, who raced for Ferrari from 1991 until 1995 when the team recruited Michael Schumacher, remembered the doctor, now aged 68. "I know Ben rather well, yes, I worked with him during my first year at Ferrari," Alesi said. He believed Bartoletti might be seeking the spotlight as a former public figure starved of attention. "Yes, I believe that certain people, when they fall down in [to] anonymity, need to launch this kind of bomb to draw attention to themselves and create a forum around them," Alesi said. Random drug tests by F1's controlling body, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile, have never returned any positive results. However, Czech driver Tomas Enge missed out on the 2002 Formula 3000 Championship title when he failed a drug test. Alesi said that apart from the health issues of taking cocaine, the FIA would have little mercy for any F1 driver taking drugs. Alesi, a Frenchman of Italian ancestry, drove in 201 GPs but won only the 1995 Canadian race. He was dogged by mechanical failures during his time with Ferrari but was one of the team's most popular drivers because of his spectacular style and passion.
