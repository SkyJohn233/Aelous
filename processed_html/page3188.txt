Students aiming to further their academic studies towards a PhD degree in the history of the Ottoman Empire, the Balkans or the Middle East, are strongly encouraged to select the MA program with thesis. Students planning to continue their research in areas other than history have the possibility to select the non-thesis MA program. Within the framework of the MA Thesis course, they are expected to research and write an MA thesis of around 80 pages on a previously submitted and approved topic. Any student who has successfully completed his/her coursework within the usual four semesters, but who needs additional thesis completion time, may, upon applying to the Social Sciences Institute, be granted a maximum of two more semesters for this purpose. Program Requirements  may vary according to the year of first enrollment. Please click to see the program requirements for new students. Continuing students may track their program requirements on Student Resources web site based on the relevant level (undergraduate/graduate), year of first enrollment and program.
