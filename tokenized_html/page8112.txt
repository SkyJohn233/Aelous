matthew dae smith/lansing state journal sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants that adage attributed to former u.s. supreme court justice louis brandeis applies especially to local government democracy can not function if citizens are uninformed the michigan freedom of information act keeps people informed by ensuring access to public documents public records for instance have shed light on shortcomings in lansing 's public housing recent inquiries into the lansing housing commission an agency under oversight from the u.s. department of housing and urban development began with a tragedy at the laroy froh housing complex a mother and her child died june 7 in an early morning fire at a publicly-managed townhome investigators said smoke detectors were working properly at the time of the incident but the deaths still raised questions about whether public institutions could have prevented the fire on the day of the fire the lansing state journal filed foia requests for records including reports from city rental inspections at the townhouse city officials initially said the city would not release those inspection records until after the lansing fire marshal 's office had completed its investigation into the fire 's cause but lansing mayor andy schor later agreed to release the documents on a more accelerated timeline read more sunshine laws opened msu documents for investigation viewpoint from matt mencarini read more how we choose to use foia matters viewpoint from chris stewart read more it could be start of a sunshine era in michigan viewpoint from jane briggs-bunting the mayor called a news conference five days after the fire in which he provided recent inspection records from laroy froh to local media the records revealed that the townhome had burned after failing its most recent rental inspection in 2016 city inspectors had identified numerous safety issues including damaged electrical outlets but the housing commission failed to provide documentation to the city to prove that management had fixed those problems and city officials failed to follow up to ensure compliance from the housing commission in fact because of the lack of follow-up the vast majority of lansing public housing complexes lacked rental licenses from the city certifying that the units were safe to rent a review by the lansing state journal found the cause of the laroy froh fire is still officially undetermined according to a fire marshal 's investigation and lansing mayor andy schor has said he does not believe city inspections could have prevented the fire if it was electrical in nature nonetheless the release of inspection records put pressure on local officials schor who took office in 2018 ordered city code officers to re-inspect all public housing units in the city to date the housing commission has spent at least 100,000 on repairs mandated by city inspectors lhc interim executive director doug fleming said the housing commission 's former executive director resigned under pressure from lansing city council members who criticized the agency 's response to the fire among other issues without foia laws citizens would not have a legal right to view records such as reports about the housing that serves some of lansing 's most vulnerable residents and issues large and small would remain in the dark sarah lehr is a local
