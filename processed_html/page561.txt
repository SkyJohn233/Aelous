Natureâ€™s marvel - Living root bridge - Yusuf Ratlamwala Meghalaya is not just one of the cleanest state of the country but also one of the most beautiful state. Tourism here is not at the peak and hence there are many hidden gems like  Dawki  yet to be discovered. During my travel to the north east I made a point to visit these less known places and also the iconic ones. Which brought me to one of the most famous places here, the  Double Decker Living Root Bridge . This place is truly natureâ€™s wonder and you have to see it to believe the way nature has architect these bridges. However even after being such an iconic place of the world, it witnesses far less tourists, reason for it beingÂ the accessibility issue. These bridges are deep in the mountains covered by thick wood. You can reach the bridges by trekking down a complete mountain and climbing half of the adjacent one. It has approximately 2000 steps one way and these are pretty steep at few spots. It is not recommended for seniors and women carrying another life within them, try to avoid it if you arenâ€™t fit to walk for hours, it took us total of 5 hours to visit this place and come back to our vehicles. Avoid carrying anything more than a bottle of water and few sandwiches/biscuits. Although eatables are available near the spot. Wear light clothes as the trek generates enough heat in you even in winter season. A stick would be a helpful aid while climbing up. However you shouldnâ€™t be disheartened if you couldnâ€™t do this trek, Living root bridge can also be seen at another place with relatively small trek that takes 10-15mins to reach. This is located in Riwai village near Mawlynnong. Seniors and pregnant ladies can reach here with little help too.  Thatâ€™s all you need to know, now letâ€™s start out virtual trek.

It is undoubtedly one of the wonders of nature. It is situated deep inside woods across mountain and can be accessed only by foot. Trek to the bridge takes around 2-2.5 hours. Itâ€™s recommended to travel light and carry just a bottle of water, wear light clothes and carry a stick if possible. However the destination is worth the effort. At the bottom of valley is present a surreal lagoon which rejuvenates you and fills you with life again. Overall the complete trek is amazing and must visit place, although not recommended for seniors and pregnant ladies.
