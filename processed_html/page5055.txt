Share a link And mild it is:  This Highlight covers the most recent developments in CO 2  fixation by homogeneous catalytic methods under mild reactions conditions. A particular focus is given to two main product categories: the formation of carboxylic acids (and derivatives) from sources comprising reactive C  H bonds, and the integration of CO 2  into (functionalized) epoxides giving rise to either cyclic carbonate or poly(carbonate) structures.
