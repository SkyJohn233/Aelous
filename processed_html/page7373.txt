Here’s a little fun fact about not just this match, but the week it took place. The week of this match was the first time in WWE history where  RAW ,  SmackDown  and NXT were main evented by women.  RAW  was main evented by a Women’s Gauntlet match,  SmackDown Live  was main evented by the Women’s Money In The Bank ladder match and the Last Woman standing match between Asuka and Cross main evented NXT. The match was certainly a memorable one, with Asuka and Cross being as innovative as possible in a desperate attempt to walk out as NXT Women’s Champion. The match turned out to be more of a war, as Asuka narrowly escaped with the NXT Women’s title.
