Next time I am going to stay much longer in this beautiful island nation. Koror is the state comprising the main commercial centre of the Republic of Palau. It consists of several islands, the most prominent being Koror Island. The state of Koror contains about 70% of the population of the country.  Palau is an archipelago of over 500 islands, part of the Micronesia region in the western Pacific Ocean. Koror Island is home to the former capital, also named Koror, and is the islandsâ€™ commercial center. The larger Babeldaob has the present capital, Ngerulmud, plus mountains and sandy beaches on its east coast. In its north, ancient basalt monoliths known as Badrulchau lie in grassy fields surrounded by palm trees. Vic Stefanu, vstefanu@yahoo.com Loading...     Loading...     Loading...     Loading...
