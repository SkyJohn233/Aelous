Windmill Acres Farm has hosted two different equine assisted riding programs in the past eight years, offering a temporary option until each of the two programs moved into a permanent facility.  Therapeutic horseback riding is the use of horses’ equine-assisted activities in order to achieve goals that enhance physical, emotional, social, cognitive, behavioral and educational skills for people who have disabilities.  It not only focuses on the therapeutic riding skills but also the development of a relationship between horse and rider and uses a team approach in order to provide treatment for the individual with the guidance of a certified riding instructor.  Listed below are two local equine assisted riding associations. ​ http://www.betterinthesaddle.org http://www.dreamcatchers.com ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ © 2017 Windmill Acres, website.
