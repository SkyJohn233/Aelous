SUMMER SESSION IV: MinehanGroup From left: BenAzmon, Lizett Aburto, Michael Khoury, Joshua Manlutac, Frederick Farrar, ArmenNazarian, Alexis Aleman, Ryan Shaktah, Dupre Orr, OswaldoMartinez, Omar Nunez, Bianca Chavez, Kevin Ng Research in theMinehan group is primarily focused on the total synthesis of natural productsand the development of new synthetic methods for carbon-carbon bond-formation,with an emphasis on the use of environmentally friendly reagents and solventsystems. Inspiration for the development of these methods comes from thecomplex structures of naturally occurring substances of medicinal andpharmaceutical import. We are currently pursuing four main lines ofinvestigation: 1. The [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement ofaliphatic allyl-alkynyl ethers is a relatively unexplored reaction in organicsynthesis. Allyl-alkynyl ethers may be generated from allyl-1,1-dichlorovinylethers by treatment with excess n-BuLi at low temperatures; however, subjectingallyl-dichlorovinyl ethers to these conditions, followed by quenching with analcohol, leads to rearranged products in the form of gamma, delta-unsaturatedesters. Sigmatropic rearrangement is occurring rapidly and stereospecificallyat low temperatures in this process. Mechanistic investigations of thisreaction are underway; the proposed ketene intermediate holds great syntheticpromise, since it may be intercepted by a wide variety of nucleophiles to forman array of carbonyl compounds in a single step. We have recently developedmilder methods for the preparation of alkynyl ethers and have successfullyapplied these methods in the rearrangement process. Currently we areinvestigating the synthesis and sigmatropic rearrangement propensity of allylalkynyl amines.  [2+2] Cycloaddition Reactivity of Alkynyl Ether-DerivedKetenes 2. Allylindium reagents, generatedin-situ from allyl halides and indium metal, react with carbonyl compounds inwater to form products containing a new carbon-carbon bond. We have prepared aseries of silyl-substituted allylindium reagents that allow multiplecarbon-carbon bonds to be formed in a single step in aqueous media uponreaction with appropriate electrophiles. Such reagents may be employed in anenvironmentally benign preparation of substituted pyrans and 7- and 8-memberedcarbocycles, which are at the core of a variety of biologically-importantnatural products. Allylic substitution reactions are important and powerfulmethods for carbon-carbon bond-formation. Environmentally benign organoindiumreagents participate in transition-metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions andallylic substitution reactions.  Wehave reported that 1-acetoxy-2,7- and 2,8-enynes undergo a palladium-catalyzedcyclization / substitution reaction in the presence of organoindium reagents toform substituted 5- and 6-membered carbo- and heterocycles. We envision thatthis process may be extended to the stereoselective synthesis of fused 6-5 ringsystems found in many natural products 3. C -aryl glycosides are an important class of naturally occurringcompounds with unique chemical and biological properties .  Possessing a carbon-carbon bond between aromatic and carbohydratemoieties, these substances are endowed with remarkable stability toward acidand enzymatic hydrolysis; this affords them sufficient intracellular lifetimeto allow trafficking to the nucleus, where they bind DNA to form stablecomplexes. Indeed, numerous members of the glycosyl arene family have been showto possess antibacterial, antitumor, and antifungal activities. We haveembarked on a program directed toward the total synthesis of members of thisfamily of natural products, and have developed new methods for their synthesis.In particular, we have recently reported an indium allylation/organoindiumcross coupling route to 2-deoxy  C -arylribofuranosides and pyranosides. Furthermore, we have accomplished the totalsyntheses of aspalathin, nothofagin, indole-3-acetonitrile-4-methoxy-2- C -beta-D-glucopyranoside, polycarcin V, 3,3’-di- O -methylardimerin, hortonones A-C, andsubamolides D and E . 4. Weare also assessing the binding affinity and sequence selectivity of  C -aryl glycosides for duplex nucleicacids using fluorescence and ultraviolet spectroscopies. Polycarcin V, whichhas an association constant for calf-thymus DNA of 1.7(±0.1) x 10 6 M -1 ,has been found to bind AT-rich DNA with an order of magnitude greater bindingaffinity than GC-rich DNA. In order to further explore the principles of carbohydrate-DNAmolecular recognition, we are currently investigating the preparation  bis -C-glycoside derivatives ofintercalating chromophores that place carbohydrate moieties in both the majorand minor grooves of DNA. Students in the Minehan group gain practical experience in thesynthesis, purification, and spectroscopic characterization of organicmolecules. Some examples of the useful skills obtained are:  1. Techniques for running reactions under inertatmosphere 2. Purification of compounds by columnchromatography and radial chromatography 3. Analysis of reactions by thin-layer chromatographyand GC-MS 4. Structure elucidation of synthetic compounds usingone- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy 5. Characterization of synthetic compounds by LC-MS,IR, and UV spectroscopies 6.
