333 it s time to dive deeper into the mystical vibrational qualities and correspondences behind this magical number in order to do this we must break down the number into its separate elements 3 33 3+3+3 9 3+3 6 in the science of numerology 3 represents creativity optimism self-expression imagination spontaneity and social enthusiasm it is the number of the performer the artist and the social butterfly a 3 also carries the vibration of indulgence and extravagance whether it be regarding eating drinking loving hating or living the universe is balanced by naturally occurring laws essential to maintaining harmony and order these are called the universal laws the universal law of threes explains that the number two is recognised as duality which is necessary for our existence some examples of duality are positive versus negative birth versus death male versus female and yin versus yang the 3 only becomes an official balancing law of the universe only when combined with a force to neutralize it three creates a unit as neither of the original two are larger or more significant than the other each portion of the whole then behaves not only for itself but also for the benefit of the entirety this can be reflected within many esoteric and religious theories of the holy triad including the shape of the number 3 itself is also extremely reflective of the vibrational energy it carries as demonstrated in the universal law of threes it is balanced with equal in s and out s no part of it being heavier than the other the pythagoreans held the belief that the 3 is the first true number it is also the first single digit number to represent a geometrical figure the triangle in ancient symbolism an upwards facing triangle represents spiritual energy action and service on the other hand a downward facing triangle represents a grounded earthly connection in the physical dimension the number 3 also represents the ascended masters who reside in the spiritual realm of higher divine energies these are the prophets healers and notable teachers who became transcendent of human limitations having lived a physical life here on earth they are especially in touch with those seeking spiritual guidance and higher consciousness but only once we invite them to remember we are beings who possess the universal law of free will and they can not intervene unless we release that free will and request them to do so this phenomenal energy reminds us that our intentions thoughts and affirmations never go unheard and they are constantly being responded to by the frequency of these sacred beings they will assist you in manifesting your desires a strong energy of the 3 in general gemini is the 3rd astrological sign in the zodiac a perfect reflection of duality and balance this astrological balance encompasses interaction communication and ideas the twins are the ever-adaptable reflection of having split personalities and perfectly displaying the dualistic nature of the sign in the tarot the 3rd card in the major arcana is the empress. this card is ruled by venus the planet that reflects anything of passion fertility beauty love and abundance it tells us to get in touch with our senses and experience contentment with life through the natural beauty that surrounds us daily it also contains a message of recognizing the need to discover new ways to express our true selves while also taking those ideas and teaching them to humanity which highly resonates with the intense message woven within the number 33 number 33 is a master number like numbers 11 and 22 master number 33 carries an incredibly strong vibration possibly the strongest of them all master number 11 reflects the vision master number 22 reflects the building master number 33 reflects the alchemist master number 33 is the epitome of absolute and perfect spiritual balance a humbled teacher resulting from the combination of the 11 insight and the 22 action carrying the highest energy of spiritual enlightenment the master builder 33 is physically understood as the ability to carry an illuminated awareness plant seeds to build foundation and utilize knowledge and experience to be a compassionate teacher and dedicated humanitarian though a 33 master teacher is full of ambition it reflects the perfected act of insightful thought contemplation before communicating this number embodies a skill of manifesting dreams and ideas to reality to a galactically astounding new level even if something does not seem practical in this physical realm it represents full-fledged alchemical capability it is a magical number reflecting a trailblazing spiritual energy driven only by intentions of a positive nature in the ancient religion of zoroastrianism the master teacher vibration is easily demonstrated and energetically wrapped up in their 3 ethical principles think good intuition of the 11 act good foundation building of the 22 and speak good teacher of the 33 by overcoming personal emotions we can learn to focus on a much higher commitment and purpose without ulterior motives or selfish personal goals serving others is the only true purpose in both our spiritual and physical existence on top of the vibration of the number 3 intensified the energy of 33 includes the vibration of a number 6 number 6 is the most harmonious vibration of all 9 single-digit numbers the 6 is the most loving and familial energy of all the single digit numbers the nurturer it is a compassionate frequency of supreme wisdom that is still grounded here in the physical as such 33 carries the energy of the 6th sign in the zodiac virgo virgo is an earth sign which is no coincidence the sign of virgo is represented by the symbol of the virgin and ruled by the planet of communication mercury virgo reflects the truest representation of analytical skill verbal communication and purity of making the world a better place just as with the 6 and the master number 33 it holds a detail-oriented energy that is very critical and thoughtful before action ironically the 3 and the 6 conflict the 6 carries an energy of analysis as opposed to the creative and imagination based 3 it gets to the heart of matter by solving problems logically this makes the energy of 33 even more intriguing it tells us to utilize our creative expression to nurture and cultivate humanitarianism on a large scale in terms of numerology 33 is without a doubt the most spiritually enlightened of all number frequencies 3+3+3 9 the number 9 carries the most spiritually enlightened energy of all single-digit numbers the energy of the 9 represents eternity the universal laws karma service to humanity spiritual awakening and the final ending being the last of the cardinal numbers the shape of the 9 is the opposite of 6 while the 6 is a symbol of compassionate motherly love the 9 shows a symbol of offering that compassion on a grander level to everyone a reservoir of giving on a global scale with a downward spout that never empties the 9th sign of the zodiac is sagittarius represented by the archer sagittarius pulls their arrow back shooting it into the unknown their ultimate goal spiritual truth-seeking and attaining enlightenment philosophy ancient wisdom conspiracies or any kind of esoteric knowledge is what this sign craves shown as the glyph of the centaur this embodies the balance of a strong connection with both the conscious physical world half animal and the subconscious and mental spiritual world half human it represents the need to be diligent and conscious enough to learn on one s own learning through travel experience and incomprehensible intuition is more of a life purpose than an egotistical goal becoming defensive over being told how to learn this independent nature makes it impossible for sagittarius to be pinned down though seemingly reckless this sign becomes bored with anything not holding a passionate interest this is usually a telltale sign of higher calling larger-than-life optimistic and enthusiastic beyond words as with the creative 3 they can also be brutally honest and straightforward as is necessary with the 9 vibration of the humanitarian and the master teacher 33 who hopes to change the world in the tarot the 9 card is the hermit it reflects inner knowing of thyself soul-searching and strong guidance while being alone the visual of this card and the message it conveys highly resonates with the number 3 and master number 33 while also carrying a very similar vibration to angel number 333 it shows a man alone on a mountain holding a staff with only a lantern to light the way mountains represent growth a staff represents a narrow and tough path taken while the light is a symbol of wisdom the hermit has achieved a s piritual peak along a path of isolation and is finally ready to share his knowledge of higher awareness attained with others the most interesting thing about this card is it displays the intense contrast of the 9 to the outgoing creative energy of the 3 and the harmonious nurturing energy of the 6 the hermit is a loner in the broader sense he doesn t mean to be an introvert but rather stands alone figuratively in his abilities to understand the world around him however he is the ultimate humanitarian and is meant to share his enlightenment and wisdom with the world the angel number 333 seen repetitively holds the combined energies vibrations and attributes of number 3 master number 33 number 9 and even the number 6 the 3 itself is representative of three characteristics understanding wisdom and harmony multiply this by 3 and the vibration is extremely potent triple number sequences hold an energetic frequency of that individual number accelerated to a much more intense vibration after understanding each those numbers we can finally understand the deeper divine meaning of angel number 333 triad of creative expression service and grounded spiritual energy 3 perfect balance of insight and action alchemy of the spiritually enlightened master teacher 33 lightworking on a global scale the epitome of a higher calling to humanitarianism 9 when you see the number 333 be sure what you are creating is aligned with a humanitarian soul mission and life purpose monitor your thoughts and actions because when you see the epic number 333 you are creating with support from divine source your alchemy is strongly resonating with and affecting the collective of all consciousness angel signs are linked to number sequences because it is the easiest way for our physical self to recognise signs from the spiritual realm the easiest way being through our sense of sight it is said that angels whisper in your ear or give a nudge of some sort for you to glance at the number at a very particular time what other explanation could there be for a repeating occurrence like this there is no such thing as coincidence it is merely divine timing pointing you to develop a higher spiritual awareness enjoyed this article then subscribe to my newsletter below to get more spiritual and mystical goodness sent straight to your

much for this article i have looked at numerous articles on the subject but this one clicked i have been seeing this number 333 regularly for 16-17 years i am somewhat habituated to it though lately it ha cropped up even more frequently since my beloved cat lucius of 15 years passed less than a week ago i am feeling the presences reality of much that was once more theory than experience in addition only just yesterday it occurred to me that i was born on the third day of the ninth month hmmm thank you again wow this article is so interesting i have been seeing 5 s everywhere for the past year and as of late i ve been seeing more and more 3 s. i will look at my clock on my phone to see 3:33 and then to make it even weirder i will also have 33 battery on my phone as well what are the odds that has happened twice this week already seriously what are the odds at the same time and it wasn t just a one time thing 2 days ago i was using my gps and saw exactly 33 minutes until i reach my destination with 33 miles left and passed exit 133a on interstate 95 north all at the same time there is just no way this can only be a coincidence it blows my mind also my numerology path number is a 33 guess its time to wake up i seem to be the odd ball when it comes to seeing the triple 3 and i hope you can help me understand why shortly after seeing those numbers repeatedly someone that i have a connection to personally dies or someone they know personally dies i cringe whenever i see that sequence of numbers why do those numbers represent death when i see them is there a way to understand if the person that is going to die is going to be my family or friend vs a friend s family or friend i ve never come across this before normally when something bad is about to happen the angels send dreams and feelings and you feel it in your gut perhaps 333 is a warning sign for you i think you need to ask your angels and spirit guide what they mean when they send you number 333 through automatic writing or a guided visualization my husband passed thru the veil on december 10th since i ve been seeing 333 everywhere most recently on my phone at 3:33 this afternoon he was a highly spiritual man a shaman not mainstream religious but spiritual he was the wisest and smartest person i have ever known he is a sagittarius we live on a foot hill of a mountain in the middle of 200 acres of woods he reads all the time to a point where he loses sleep bc of reading he and i both have referred to ourselves and hermits when we first met one of the first questions he asked me is what are you passionate about ..we both experience strangers coming up to us just to touch our arm or shoulder as they are wanting a blessing children and animals have no issues with us and will walk right up to us both he worked with people of disabilities not only as an investigator for the state but he wrote the mandates for disability facilities throughout our state of arkansas and he was ever so proud to be with them he said they set him free knowing him as i do and reading the article and seeing him all over it where does that leave me of course i miss him more than i can say and have thought my hearing his favorite bird sing outside my window seeing small things or noticing small things is just me being desperate to see those things but is it desperation or is it him sending me signs i think i am going crazy i am an empath very sensitive so i thought i was just wanting too hard i am latrium son of yazul i am a lazarion angel my purpose for father is to capture cast downs and inities i was before the pyramids i carry the mark of orion s the number 3 is vital to all angels and we are many 333 yashua was 33 when his life was sacrificed and he rose on the third day he said tear this temple down and i will raise it back in three days he told his disciple you will deny me three times before the rooster crows you are right about the number three but know this what i have read on your page is wrong and misleading in your life you have probably crossed paths with angels each one different i am latrium the hunter angel if you want pictures or proof i can provide them but understand this what i am you can not understand and what you call the bible 85 percent is either lies or fiction and not one angel has wings and morning star would like it if you quit blaming him for all the bad things that happen you call him lucifer i will tell you what the cause of humanity is free will free will you make the choice to either work at the bank or you choose to rob it morning star had nothing to do with it but your choice to choose did free will is what mankind suffers from your email address will not be published required fields are marked name* email* website save my
