They came in exactly on budget and the pool looked better than I could have imagined. I have an odd yard with a slope and they worked around all the problems to give me a better yard than I could have hoped for.  Would strongly recommend them for any work ,  you won ' t find better more honest people.  Thank you ! Avoca is one of those rare companies that is up front and stands behind the work they do. During our first meeting with Glynn ,  we were immediately impressed with his professionalism. Glynn knew what he was talking about and took the time to figure out just what it was we wanted. Unlike some of the companies we met with ,  there were no pressure tactics and our needs and wants were put ahead of what it was they wanted to do. The crew was courteous ,  professional and obviously proud of the work they do.  Over the years I have had friends put in pools and heard horror stories over delays and price increases. Avoca does one job at a time and stuck to the budget. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to install a pool.  Avoca Pools were professional and courteous no matter whether we were speaking with the manager or the staff working on our backyard. They made sure that the work was done right and responded to our questions as new pool owners even a year after the work was completed. We would recommend them to any one who wants quality workmanship and a company who will stand behind their work. I have included a picture of the pool when the work was in progress.                                           Avoca Pools and Landscape Inc. has a TrustScore  of 4.1.
