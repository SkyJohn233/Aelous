nerdyroom™nerdyroom™ never read the manual node 5 1 '51 5 1 4 node 5 1 51 5 1 4 recently i switched from environment modules to lmod because of reasons i really like it so far but one thing annoyed me a bit when executing sudo -s which is one of my usual workflows my shell reports module command not found the reason is simple sudo dumps most of the users environment with some exceptions due to env_reset in /etc/sudoers when spawning the new non-login shell specifically the last fact causes the trouble since lmod is activated by sourcing the proper file on login- shell startup in my case following the lmod docs there is a soft link in /etc/profile.d pointing to /usr/share/lmod/lmod/init/profile my first attempts to modify the env_keep list in /etc/sudoers didn t work because the module command itself is set as a shell function which afaik can not be handled by that list of kept variables from the shell environment bash_func_module eval lmod_cmd bash 0 eval lmod_settarg_cmd -s sh type module module is a function module eval lmod_cmd bash 0 eval lmod_settarg_cmd -s sh so i saw no other solution but adding the following code snippet to my /etc/bash.bashrc this will test if there is a lmod_cmd environment variable set if not it will source the proper file to activate lmod feel free to post if there are better solution cheerio recently i switched from environment modules to lmod because of reasons i really like it so far but one thing annoyed me a bit when executing sudo -s which for those of you who haven t already heard lenovo launched a survey to recreate a thinkpad like in the good old days when design followed function and not the other way around http //blog.lenovo.com/tag/retro+thinkpad for those of you who haven t already heard lenovo launched a survey to recreate a thinkpad like in the good old days when design followed function and not the other guten tag var_s_fullname mehr als 70 euro pro monat muss eine krankenversicherung when i want to find out specific process information i usually use ps aux grep pattern there are several drawbacks but the most annoying one for me are the missing coloumn headlines therefore i made this little alias and put it into my global bash.bashrc file alias psgrep= ps u head -n 1 ps aux grep -v grep grep this enables a psgrep command which can be used like grep since that is exactly what it is maybe some of you know an even better way cheerio when i want to find out specific process information i usually use ps aux grep pattern there are several drawbacks but the most annoying one for me are the if you have an ubuntu phone like the aquaris e4.5 from bq you can backup your contacts the following way do not follow the instructions on this website the sudo leads to an error creating source registry can not autolaunch d-bus without x11 display while the database=personal leads to error database not found personal if you have an ubuntu phone like the aquaris e4.5 from bq you can backup your contacts the following way install the terminal app from ubuntu core app developers open if there is a award for the most useful website on the internet i d nominate this one https //software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/intrinsicsguide/ if there is a award for the most useful website on the internet i d nominate this one https //software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/intrinsicsguide/ http //arstechnica.com/the-multiverse/2015/03/vote-for-the-final-four-of-ars-march-hacker-movie-madness/ http //arstechnica.com/the-multiverse/2015/03/vote-for-the-final-four-of-ars-march-hacker-movie-madness/ a life is like a garden perfect moments can be had but not preserved except in memory llap a life is like a garden perfect moments can be had but not preserved except in memory llap leonard nimoy therealnimoy february 23 2015 a life is like a garden perfect moments can be had but not preserved except in memory llap a life is like a garden perfect moments can be had but hi i moved the blog which is more of an archive of the good ol times these days to a new server lets see if everyhting still works hi i moved the blog which is more of an archive of the good ol times these days to a new server lets see if everyhting still works iframes not working click here
