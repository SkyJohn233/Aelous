ClearPath Analytics | Market Research Analysis | NBRI Different types of data require different types of statistical analyses. This is especially true of psychological research, including  employee surveys  and  customer surveys , and  market research . For instance, a stand-alone employee survey is  reported  in terms of its N’s, means, distribution of responses, and benchmarking scores, but it is  analyzed  by NBRI with a Root Cause Analysis, including intercorrelations among the predictors for identifying multicollinearity in the regression.  The output of the Root Cause Analysis provides Management with those 3 to 5  perceptions  in employee thinking that are driving behavior.  When these are addressed, employee productivity, engagement, and loyalty are improved in the most expedient manner possible. Longitudinal studies, such as those of customers or guests with frequent data collections, require generalized estimating equations to fit a repeated measures logistic regression.  Generalized linear mixed models may also be used by extending the linear model so that the target is linearly related to the factors and covariates via a specified link function. With this type of analysis, Clients are able to ‘cut to the chase.’  There is no time or money wasted trying to decide what to work on or what actions should be taken.  NBRI provides the analyses and the training to respond to the results.  Without doctoral level educations in statistics, we do not recommend that our Clients attempt to analyze their own data.  This expertise is a critical component of all scientific, psychological research, and the means by which NBRI provides Clients with a Clear Path to dramatic organizational improvement.
