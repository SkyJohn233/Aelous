Space Designer Logic IRs are installed, b‚Ä¶ - Apple Community               Looks like no one‚Äôs replied in a while.               To start the conversation again, simply ask a new question. Howdy, I'm using Logic Pro X 10.2.  I can‚Äôt load my Logic Space Designer IRs on the Space Designer interface via the drop down menu. IE - I CAN load IRs one-by-one, manually by clicking the IR button and trawling through my Macbook library etc and doing it that way - but obviously this is not cool‚Ä¶ This is where my Space Designer, Logic IRs downloaded to by default: Users/garethebbs/Music/Audio Music Apps/Plug-In Settings/Space Designer 2)   Users/garethebbs/Music/Audio Music Apps/Impulse Responses In the Logic Effects manual it states ‚ÄúAll impulse responses that ship with Logic Pro are installed in the /Library/Audio/Impulse Responses/Apple folder. Deconvolution files have an .sdir file extension.‚Äù So I have copied the IR folders in there also. I don‚Äôt have this folder below - I don't think it ever existed on my Macbook Pro. But some people have mentioned they have their Logic IRs in there: Library / Application Support / Logic / Impulse Responses -  so I set up this folder and copied the IRs in there to try, but nothing happened, so I deleted it again to return my computer to original settings. I also tried copying them into Library / Application Support / Logic / Plug-In Settings / Space Designer but this didn‚Äôt do anything either‚Ä¶so I deleted them back out. The only IRs, that are actually working properly - IE, they are actually showing in the dropdown Space Designer window (see pic) are some Lexicon 480L IRs which I downloaded and as per the instructions from the 3rd party website, I put them into: /Users/garethebbs/Music/Audio Music Apps/Plug-In Settings/Space Designer /Users/garethebbs/Music/Audio Music Apps/Impulse Responses (The Logic IRs are in there too‚Ä¶but obviously they do NOT appear with the Lexicons in the dropdown menu). I've also tried installing other Lexicons PCM90 with no success. Tried all possible locations. Just very frustrated at this point‚Ä¶any help would be greatly appreciated. Hope my post isn‚Äôt too confusing‚Ä¶I‚Äôm pretty confused myself at this stage‚Ä¶ Thanks Gar Pic - this is what I get when I click the dropdown bar - as mentioned above, no Logic IRs, just third party Lexicons.

Note: This is the System Library not the User Library.... which is where I am guessing you have been looking... Go to Finder's Menu bar.. Choose Go and then Go To Folder option.. Now paste the following into there and press return... /Library/Audio/Impulse Responses/Apple You should find all the responses there...  The user folder    Users/ < User Name > /Music/Audio Music Apps/Impulse Responses is for presets you save yourself via the dropdown menu in the plugin itself... plus any 3rd party presets.. that might get installed there..

I have the IRs - they are in that folder you have described above (as well as other locations as described) - and I did as you said and copy-pasted the link in etc just to double check (see pic below). I can load them one by one if I really want to. They are on the computer, seemingly in the correct location(s). My problem is the IRs do not show up in the dropdown menu at the SD interface (see pic above)                                     Jan 23, 2016 8:12 AM                                                                 Jan 23, 2016 8:23 AM in response to Denalihighway                                                                 In response to Denalihighway                               Ok.. you are talking about presets not the SDIR files themselves.... The "built in" presets are found in the System Library as follows... /Library/Application Support/Logic/Plug-in Settings/Space Designer In my case.. with my system drive named Server HD... they are here...

OK , looks like someone has finally pointed me the right direction üôÇ Sorry it seems like I should have been labelling what was missing the "presets" and not just "IRs" like I had said. So this is my version of that location -  Macintosh HD /Library/Application Support/Logic/Plug-in Settings/Space Designer And lo and behold...practically blank. I guess I gotta get my hands on those pst files and get them in there? I'm new to Logic and Macs BTW too...it probably shows.

Welcome to the wonderful, though sometimes mysterious, world of Apple üôÇ Anyhow the question is.. why didn't they get installed as normal? Try this... Download the excellent Find Any File from here... http://apps.tempel.org/FindAnyFile/ and then use that to search your system drive for the following word.. Opulent That should bring up a file called 06.5s Opulent Ballroom.pst Wherever that is.. is where the rest of your presets are..... If its not there then use the Logic Pro X menu item Logic Pro X  >  Sound Library and check via the sound library Manager that all Content including Reverbs has been installed ... If it say it has then use Reinstall Sound Library to reinstall all the content that should have been automatically downloaded... including the missing presets, into the correct locations... Note: This command will download and install all the content again.... which is about 60GB but it seems it might be worth it as who knows whatever you are missing..... Or.. rather than playing safe or if you have slow internet or limited download capacities.. open the Sound Library Manager (via the same menu option) and reselect and download the essential content , the reverb content and the Legacy Logic Pro 2 and GB content... by clicking on the check boxes.. (It will ask if you want to download all again or just what hasn't been installed.. Select all) and see if thats enough to fix your problem...

I have gone though all of the steps listed above, and I've copied my own IR folder to: HD  >  Library  >  Audio  >  Impulse Responses  >  Apple  HD  >  Users  >  joeconstantino  >  Music  >  Audio Music Apps  >  Plug-In Settings  >  Space Designer HD  >  Library  >  Application Support  >  Logic  >  Plug-In Settings  >  Space Designer I am having the same issue, where I can load them individually, but not via the menu (or even see them in the menu). Any and all help would be very appreciated. Thank you! Best, Joe                                     Mar 26, 2016 8:51 PM                                                                 Mar 26, 2016 8:53 PM in response to Denalihighway                                                                 In response to Denalihighway                               I should mention ‚Äì my IR files are from the Bricasti M7 set (highly recommended!).. they are WAV files. They worked great in Altiverb, and as I mentioned they work when I load them individually in Space Designer, but they're not showing up at all in the dropdown menu. Thank you again!                                     Mar 26, 2016 8:53 PM                                                                 Mar 26, 2016 9:11 PM in response to JConstantino                                                                 In response to JConstantino                               For actual IR files.... Put the folder which contains your IRs in If you don‚Äôt yet have the Impulse Responses folder in that location, create it... spelled exactly as shown above... (Upper case/space etc) Note: Pay attention to the tilde (~) at the beginning of the path.....indicating this folder in  a User folder and not a System one... For further guidance see the following http://logic-pro-expert.com/logic-pro-blog/2014/02/20/lexicon-480l-free-impulse- responses-for-space-designer.html#.VvdZ6‚Ä¶ However... In SD via the Drop down menu.. those are not IR files you are accessing or seeing.. those are PST (Preset files) You need to create a User preset for any given IR file... for it to appear in the drop down menu Again, see the example zip file provided in the web article I linked to above... and you will see what I mean...                                     Mar 26, 2016 9:11 PM                               Question: Q: Space Designer Logic IRs are installed, but still not appearing in dropdown menu on Space Designer interface? More Less
