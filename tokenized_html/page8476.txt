the us billboard 200 3 the lead single smells like teen spirit was a critical success and peaked at number six on the billboard hot 100 4 three other successful singles were produced come as you are

topped the single of the year and video of the year polls 6 nevermind has sold over 30 million copies worldwide making it one of the best-selling albums of all time it was certified diamond by the recording industry association of america riaa nevermind was responsible in part for bringing both grunge and alternative rock music to a mainstream audience and has been ranked highly on lists of the greatest and most influential albums of all time by publications in 2005 the library of congress added nevermind to the national recording registry which collects culturally historically or aesthetically important sound recordings nirvana was a rock band from aberdeen washington formed by kurt cobain and krist novoselic in 1987 that had signed to seattle independent record label sub pop the band released their debut album bleach in 1989 with chad channing on drums however channing left nirvana in 1990 and the band was in need of a permanent drummer during a show by hardcore punk band scream the group 's drummer dave grohl impressed cobain and novoselic when scream unexpectedly disbanded grohl contacted novoselic travelled to seattle and was soon invited to join the band novoselic said in retrospect that when grohl joined the band everything fell into place 7 meanwhile cobain was writing a number of new songs at the time cobain was listening to bands like the melvins r.e.m the smithereens and the pixies feeling disillusioned by the heavy detuned rock popular in the seattle grunge scene upon which sub pop had built its image cobain—inspired by his contemporary listening habits—began writing songs that were more melodic a key development was the single sliver released on sub pop in 1990 before grohl joined the band which cobain said was like a statement in a way i had to write a pop song and release it on a single to prepare people for the next record i wanted to write more songs like that 8 grohl said that the band at that point often made the analogy of likening their music to children 's music in that the band tried to make its songs as simple as possible 7 by the start of the 1990s sub pop was experiencing financial difficulties with rumors that sub pop would sign up as a subsidiary of a major record label the band decided to cut out the middleman and start to look for a major record label 7 a number of labels courted the band but nirvana ultimately signed with geffen records imprint dgc records based upon repeated recommendations from kim gordon of sonic youth and their management company 2 in early 1990 nirvana began planning its second album for sub pop tentatively titled sheep for the album sub pop head bruce pavitt suggested butch vig as a potential producer 7 nirvana particularly liked vig 's work with killdozer and called vig up to tell him we want to sound as heavy as that record 9 the band traveled out to vig 's smart studios in madison wisconsin recording from april 2 to 6 1990 10 most of the basic song arrangements were completed by that time but cobain was still working on lyrics and the band was unsure of which songs to record 11 ultimately eight songs were recorded immodium later renamed breed dive later released as the b-side to sliver in bloom pay to play eventually renamed stay away and given a new set of lyrics sappy lithium here she comes now released on velvet underground tribute album heaven and hell volume 1 and polly 12 on april 6 the band played a local show in madison with fellow seattle band tad 13 vig began to mix the recordings while the band hung out in madison giving an interview to madison 's community radio station wort on april 7 14 nirvana had planned to record more tracks but cobain had strained his voice forcing nirvana to shut down recording on april 8 the group headed to milwaukee to kick off an extensive midwest and east coast tour of 24 shows in 39 days 15 vig was told that the group would come back to record more songs but the producer did not hear anything for a while 7 with the band parting ways with drummer chad channing after the tour additional recording was put on hold instead nirvana used the sessions as a demo tape to shop for a new label within a few months the tape was circulating amongst major labels creating a buzz around the group 16 after signing to dgc a number of producers for the album were suggested including scott litt david briggs and don dixon but nirvana still wanted butch vig 17 novoselic noted in 2001 that the band was already nervous about recording on a major label and the producers suggested by dgc wanted percentage points for working on the album instead the band held out for vig with whom they felt comfortable collaborating 18 afforded a budget of 65,000 nirvana recorded nevermind at sound city studios in van nuys california in may and june 1991 19 nirvana was originally set to record the album during march and april 1991 but the date kept getting pushed back in spite of the band 's eagerness to begin the sessions to earn gas money to get to los angeles nirvana played a show where they performed smells like teen spirit for the first time 7 the band sent vig some rehearsal tapes prior to the sessions that featured songs recorded previously at smart studios along with some new ones including smells like teen spirit and come as you are 20 when the group arrived in california nirvana did a few days of pre-production where the band and vig tightened up some of the song arrangements 21 the only recording carried over from the smart studios sessions was the song polly which included cymbal crashes performed by chad channing once recording commenced the band worked eight to ten hours a day the band members tended to take two or three tries at instrumental takes if the takes were not satisfactory at that point they would move on to something else 22 the group had rehearsed the songs so much before recording started that often only a few takes were needed 18 cobain used a variety of guitars from stratocasters to jaguars and novoselic used a black 1979 and natural 1976 gibson ripper novoselic and grohl finished their bass and drum tracks in a matter of days but cobain had to work longer on guitar overdubs singing and particularly lyrics which sometimes were finished mere minutes before recording 23 cobain 's phrasing was so consistent on various takes that vig would mix the takes together to create overdubs 22 vig says that he often had to trick cobain into recording additional takes for overdubs since the singer was averse to performing multiple takes in particular vig convinced cobain to double-track his vocals on the song in bloom by telling him john lennon did it 7 while the sessions went well generally vig said cobain would become moody and difficult at times he 'd be great for an hour and then he 'd sit in a corner and say nothing for an hour 9 after the recording sessions were completed vig and the band set out to mix the album however after a few days both vig and the band members realized that they were unhappy with how the mixes were turning out as a result they decided to call in someone else to oversee the mixing with geffen records imprint dgc supplying a list of possible options the list contained several familiar names including scott litt known for his work with r.e.m and ed stasium known for his work with the ramones and the smithereens however cobain feared that bringing in known mixers would result in the album sounding like the work of those bands instead cobain chose andy wallace who had co-produced slayer 's 1990 album seasons in the abyss from the bottom of the list 24 novoselic recalled we said 'right on because those slayer records were so heavy 25 wallace ran the songs through various special effects boxes and tweaked the drum sounds completing about one mix per day 26 both wallace and vig noted years later that upon hearing wallace 's work the band loved the mixes 27 after the album 's release however members of nirvana expressed dissatisfaction with the polished sound the mixer had given nevermind cobain said in come as you are looking back on the production of nevermind i 'm embarrassed by it now it 's closer to a mötley crüe record than it is a punk rock record 26 nevermind was mastered on the afternoon of august 2 at the mastering lab in hollywood california howie weinberg started working alone when no one else showed up at the appointed time in the studio by the time nirvana andy wallace and gary gersh arrived weinberg had mastered most of the album 28 one of the songs mastered at the session a hidden track called endless nameless intended to appear at the end of something in the way was accidentally left off initial pressings of the album weinberg recalled in the beginning it was kind of a verbal thing to put that track at the end maybe i misconstrued their instructions so you can call it my mistake if you want maybe i did n't write it down when nirvana or the record company said to do it so when they pressed the first twenty thousand or so cds albums and cassettes it was n't on there when the band discovered the song 's omission after listening to its copy of the album cobain called weinberg and demanded he rectify the mistake 29 weinberg complied and added about ten minutes of silence between the end of something in the way and the start of the hidden track on future pressings of the album 30 cobain nirvana 's main songwriter fashioned chord sequences using primarily power chords and wrote songs that combined pop hooks with dissonant guitar riffs his aim for nevermind 's material was to sound like the knack and the bay city rollers getting molested by black flag and black sabbath 31 many of the songs on nevermind feature shifts in dynamics where the band changes from quiet verses to loud choruses dave grohl said this approach originated during a four-month period prior to the recording of the album where the band would experiment with extreme dynamics during regular jam sessions 32 however the smart studios recordings of songs such as lithium and in bloom show the band was writing songs in that style long before grohl had joined the band guitar world wrote kurt cobain 's guitar sound on nirvana 's nevermind set the tone for nineties rock music on nevermind cobain played a 1960s fender mustang a fender jaguar with dimarzio pickups and a few fender stratocasters with humbucker bridge pickups the guitarist used distortion and chorus pedals as his main effects the latter used to generate a watery sound on come as you are and the pre-choruses of smells like teen spirit 33 krist novoselic tuned down his bass guitar one and a half steps to d flat to get this fat-ass sound 18 grohl has said that cobain told him music comes first and lyrics come second and grohl believes that above all cobain focused on the melodies of his songs 7 cobain was still working on the album 's lyrics well into the recording of nevermind additionally cobain 's phrasing on the album is often difficult to understand vig asserted that clarity of cobain 's singing was not paramount vig said even though you could n't quite tell what he was singing about you knew it was intense as hell 7 cobain would later complain when rock journalists attempted to decipher his singing and extract meaning from his lyrics writing why in the hell do journalists insist on coming up with a second-rate freudian evaluation of my lyrics when 90 percent of the time they 've transcribed them incorrectly 34 charles r. cross asserted in his 2001 biography of cobain heavier than heaven that many of the songs written for nevermind were about cobain 's dysfunctional relationship with tobi vail after their relationship ended cobain began writing and painting violent scenes many of which revealed a hatred for himself and others songs written during this period were less violent but still reflected anger absent from cobain 's earlier songs cross wrote in the four months following their break-up kurt would write a half dozen of his most memorable songs all of them about tobi vail drain you begins with the line one baby to another said i 'm lucky to have met you quoting what vail had once told cobain and the line it is now my duty to completely drain you refers to the power vail had over cobain in their relationship according to novoselic 'lounge act is about tobi and the song contains the line i 'll arrest myself i 'll wear a shield referring to cobain having the k records logo tattooed on his arm to impress vail though lithium had been written before cobain knew vail the lyrics of the song were changed to reference her 35 cobain also said in an interview with musician that some of my very personal experiences like breaking up with girlfriends and having bad relationships feeling that death void that the person in the song is feeling–very lonely sick 36 the tentative title sheep was something cobain created as an inside joke directed towards the people he expected to buy the album he wrote a fake advertisement for sheep in his journal that read because you want to not because everyone else is 37 novoselic said the inspiration for the title was the band 's cynicism about the public 's reaction to operation desert storm 18 as recording ended cobain grew tired of the title and suggested to novoselic that the album be named nevermind cobain liked the title because it was a metaphor for his attitude on life and because it was grammatically incorrect 38 the album cover shows a naked baby boy spencer elden 39 swimming underwater with a u.s. dollar bill on a fishhook just out of his reach according to cobain he conceived the idea while watching a television program on water births with grohl cobain mentioned it to geffen 's art director robert fisher fisher found some stock footage of underwater births but they were too graphic for the record company furthermore the stock house that controlled the photo of a swimming baby that they chose wanted 7,500 a year for its use instead fisher sent a photographer kirk weddle to a pool for babies to take pictures five shots resulted and the band settled on the image of four-month-old spencer elden the son of a friend of weddle 40 geffen were concerned that the infant 's penis visible in the photo would cause offense and prepared an alternate cover without it they relented when cobain said the only compromise he would accept would be a sticker covering the penis reading if you 're offended by this you must be a closet pedophile 41 the back cover features a photograph of a rubber monkey in front of a collage created by cobain the collage features photos of raw beef from a supermarket advertisement images from dante 's inferno and pictures of diseased vaginas from cobain 's collection of medical photos cobain note if you look real close there is a picture of kiss in the back standing on a slab of beef 42 the album 's liner notes contain no complete lyrics instead the liner contains random song lyrics and unused lyrical fragments that cobain arranged into a poem 43 for the albums 10th 17th and 25th anniversaries elden recreated the front cover shot for photographers he wanted to do the 25th anniversary shoot nude but the photographer preferred that he wore swim shorts 44 in 2003 he appeared on the cover of cevin key 's album the dragon experience 45 nevermind was released on september 24 1991 american record stores received an initial shipment of 46,251 copies 46 while 35,000 copies were shipped in the united kingdom where bleach had been successful 47 the lead single smells like teen spirit had been released on september 10 with the intention building a base among alternative rock fans while the next single come as you are would possibly garner more attention 48 days before the release date the band began a short american tour in support of the album geffen hoped that nevermind would sell around 250,000 copies matching sales of sonic youth 's geffen debut goo 49 the best estimate was that nevermind could be certified gold 500,000 copies sold by september 1992 50 nevermind debuted on the billboard 200 at number 144 51 geffen shipped about half of the initial u.s. pressing to the american northwest where it sold out quickly and was unavailable for days geffen put production of all other albums on hold in order to fulfill demand in the region 52 over the next few months sales increased significantly as smells like teen spirit unexpectedly became more and more popular the song 's video had received a world premiere on mtv 's late-night alternative show 120 minutes and soon proved so popular that the channel began playing it during the day 53 the record was soon certified gold but the band was relatively uninterested novoselic recalled yeah i was happy about it it was pretty cool it was kind of neat but i do n't give a shit about some kind of achievement like that it 's cool—i guess 54 as the band set out for their european tour at the start of november 1991 nevermind entered the billboard top 40 for the first time at number 35 by this point smells like teen spirit had become a hit and the album was selling so fast none of geffen 's marketing strategies could be enacted geffen president ed rosenblatt told the new york times we did n't do anything it was just one of those 'get out of the way and duck records 55 nirvana found as they toured europe during the end of 1991 that the shows were dangerously oversold television crews became a constant presence onstage and smells like teen spirit was almost omnipresent on radio and music television 56 nevermind became nirvana 's first number-one album on january 11 1992 replacing michael jackson at the top of the billboard charts by this time nevermind was selling approximately 300,000 copies a week 57 58 come as you are was released as the second single in march 1992 it peaked at number nine on the u.k. singles chart and at number 32 on the billboard hot 100 singles chart 59 two more singles lithium and in bloom peaked at number 11 and 28 on the uk singles chart respectively 60 nevermind was certified gold and platinum by the recording industry association of america in november 1991 and certified diamond in march 1999 61 it was also certified diamond in canada 1,000,000 units sold by the canadian recording industry association in march 2001 62 and five times platinum in the united kingdom 63 geffen 's press promotion for nevermind was lower than that typical of a major record label the label 's publicist primarily targeted music publications with long lead times for publication as well as magazines in the seattle area the unexpectedly positive feedback from critics who had received the album convinced the label to consider increasing the album 's original print run 47 at first nevermind did not receive many reviews and many publications ignored the album months after its release and after smells like teen spirit garnered airplay print media organizations were scrambling to cover the phenomenon the album had become however by that point much of the attention fell on cobain rather than the album itself the reviews that did initially appear were largely positive 74 karen schoemer of the new york times wrote with 'nevermind nirvana has certainly succeeded there are enough intriguing textures mood shifts instrumental snippets and inventive word plays to provide for hours of entertainment schoemer concluded 'nevermind is more sophisticated and carefully produced than anything peer bands like dinosaur jr. and mudhoney have yet offered 75 entertainment weekly gave nevermind an a– rating and reviewer david browne argued that on nevermind nirvana never entertain the notion of wanting to sound normal compared to other contemporary alternative bands 68 concluding his very enthusiastic review for the british melody maker everett true wrote that when nirvana released bleach all those years ago the more sussed among us figured they had the potential to make an album that would blow every other contender away my god have they proved us right 76 spin gave nevermind a favorable review stating that you 'll be humming all the songs for the rest of your life—or at least until your cd-tape-album wears out 77 select compared the band to jane 's addiction sonic youth and the pixies stating that the album proves that nirvana truly belong in such high company 73 some of the reviews were not entirely positive rolling stone originally gave the album three out of five stars 78 reviewer ira robbins wrote if nirvana is n't onto anything altogether new nevermind does possess the songs character and confident spirit to be much more than a reformulation of college radio 's high-octane hits 71 the boston globe was less enthusiastic about the album reviewer steve morse wrote most of nevermind is packed with generic punk-pop that had been done by countless acts from iggy pop to the red hot chili peppers and added the band has little or nothing to say settling for moronic ramblings by singer-lyricist cobain 78 nevermind was voted as the best album of the year in the village voice pazz jop critics poll smells like teen spirit also topped the single of the year and video of the year polls 6 nevermind topped the poll by a large majority and village voice critic robert christgau wrote in his companion piece to the poll as a modest pop surprise they might have scored a modest victory like de la soul in 1990 instead their multi-platinum takeover constituted the first full-scale public validation of the amerindie values—the noise the toons the 'tude—the radder half of the pazz jop poll electorate came up on 79 nevermind popularized the seattle grunge movement and brought alternative rock as a whole into the mainstream establishing its commercial and cultural viability 80 its success surprised nirvana 's contemporaries who felt dwarfed by its impact fugazi frontman guy picciotto later said it was like our record could have been a hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had it felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did 81 karen schoemer of the new york times wrote that what 's unusual about nirvana 's nevermind is that it caters to neither a mainstream audience nor the indie rock fans who supported the group 's debut album 82 in 1992 jon pareles of the new york times described that in the aftermath of the album 's breakthrough suddenly all bets are off no one has the inside track on which of dozens perhaps hundreds of ornery obstreperous unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall-walking millions record company executives offered large advances and record deals to bands and previous strategies of building audiences for alternative rock bands had been replaced by the opportunity to achieve mainstream popularity quickly 83 michael azerrad argued in his nirvana biography come as you are the story of nirvana 1993 that nevermind marked an epochal generational shift in music similar to the rock-and-roll explosion in the 1950s and the end of the baby boomer generation 's dominance of the musical landscape azerrad wrote nevermind came along at exactly the right time this was music by for and about a whole new group of young people who had been overlooked ignored or condescended to 84 in its citation placing it at number 17 in its 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time rolling stone said no album in recent history had such an overpowering impact on a generation—a nation of teens suddenly turned punk—and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator 85 gary gersh who signed nirvana to geffen records added that there is a pre-nirvana and post-nirvana record business 'nevermind showed that this was n't some alternative thing happening off in a corner and then back to reality this is reality 86 nevermind has continued to garner critical praise since its release the album was listed at number 17 on rolling stone s list the 500 greatest albums of all time 85 maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list 87 rolling stone also rated nevermind as the number one best album of the 1990s calling it the album that guaranteed the nineties would not suck 88 time placed nevermind which writer josh tyrangiel called the finest album of the 90s on its 2006 list of the all-time 100 albums 89 pitchfork named the album the sixth best of the decade noting that anyone who hates this record today is just trying to be cool and needs to be trying harder 90 in 2005 the library of congress added nevermind to the national recording registry which collects culturally historically or aesthetically important sound recordings from the 20th century 91 on the other hand nevermind was voted the most overrated album in the world in a 2005 bbc public poll 92 in 2006 readers of guitar world ranked nevermind 8th on a list of the 100 greatest guitar recordings 93 entertainment weekly named it the 10th best album of all time on their 2013 list 94 in 2019 nevermind was ranked no 1 on rolling stone 's 50 greatest grunge albums list 95 the same magazine named the album at no 10 in their list 40 greatest punk albums of all time 96 it was voted number 17 in the third edition of colin larkin 's all time top 1000 albums 2000 97 novoselic revealed in 2019 that nevermind s master tapes were likely lost in the 2008 universal fire the fire the extent of which was long undisclosed destroyed a swath of universal studios hollywood 's outdoor lot and nearly all the master recordings stored there in a universal music group archive master recordings from artists ranging from louis armstrong to tom petty were also lost in the fire 98 in 1996 mobile fidelity sound labs released nevermind on vinyl as part of its anadisq 200 series and as a 24- carat gold cd the cd pressings included endless nameless the lp version quickly sold out its limited pressing but the cd edition stayed in print for years 99 in 2009 original recordings group released nevermind on limited edition 180g blue vinyl and regular 180g black vinyl mastered
