alex trebek jeopardy host talks metoo truths 'scary time for men washington times sign in manage newsletters impeachment the gift that keeps on giving virginia dem mulls national guard to enforce upcoming gun laws an idea likely to end in violence yes james comey facts really do matter big mike horowitz in i.g. the jury analysis/opinion alex trebek the 78-year-old long-time host of jeopardy sat down with vulture to talk politics and culture and metoo and more and said what we ve all been thinking for some time particularly post-brett kavanaugh s supreme court battle and that s this it s a scary time to be a guy indeed all it takes is a finger-point a whisper an accusation and bam the sexual harasser sexual abuser sexual attacker label is affixed unless the guy can prove his innocence it s game over guilty as charged when the metoo movement started i had discussions with the staff during production meetings trebek said vulture reported i said my gosh this has got to be a scary time for men i m fortunate that i ve never been in a position of power where i might be able to lord it over somebody sexually i said but there are guys out there young guys are stupid in their teens there s nothing stupider than a teenage boy they re operating on testosterone top stories comedian patton oswalt blasts trump voters stupid a holes virginia dem mulls national guard to enforce upcoming gun laws an idea likely to end in violence student s bus beating seen by millions on twitter mom says pro-trump hat sparked attack and therein lies a major problem at what point does stupid boy become criminal man forget due process forget justice and fair play the metoo campaign has gone far beyond its original intent to out real attackers and abusers who ve used their fame and fortune and positions of power to abuse girls and women and morphed into a sort of mesaysoyouguilty movement it s been corrupted by angry radicals far-left entities progressive-minded partisans who want nothing more than to tear males down and take revenge on them for their maleness and that s a real shame because on surface anyway driving out the scum of male society the ones who prey on young women for their own personal power trips should be a no-brainer of an endeavor one that unites both men and women of character and principle the left simply destroys everything it touches â€¢ cheryl chumley can
