why director/adapter/book-it co-founder myra platt and composer/lyricist/actor/musician justin huertas could n't turn the same source material into a magical musical huertas 's humor and platt 's experience boded well and there seemed to be plenty of opportunity to buck the conventions of generic musical theater and run with something a little wilder i liked the poster but though the performances were generally fantastic this production could n't overcome the big problem presented by the story of howl 's moving castle it 's boring all that said platt does retain a lot of the gender and age fluidity that makes jones 's novel interesting to think about for more than 15 minutes and that combined with her decision to scrap sophie 's happily-ever-after ending ingeniously if indirectly made room for characters and designers to make choices they would n't have been able to make rich smith julie alpert and andy arkley desert daze the husband-and-wife team of julie alpert
