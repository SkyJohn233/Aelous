Christopher - Free Fall Lyrics | Musixmatch You know, I knowWe are standing on the edge of mysteryIf you jump, I jumpThat's the only way to set us freeFallJump in one, two, threeFallBaby this is whereBaby this is where you run awayBaby this is what you wanna beBaby this is where you run away, run awayHow can two peopleFall in love at the same timeActing like it's not possibleWe'll both deniedWhen you see the leaves fallingBaby know that you can lean on meI can promise anythingYou've just got to trust me babyYou know, and I knowWe are standing on the edge of mysteryIf you jump, I jumpThat's the only way to set us freeFallJump in one, two, threeFallBaby this is whereBaby this is where you run awayBaby this is what you wanna beBaby this is where you run away, run awayYou're not out there, out thereBut we've got to goYou don't have to be scared, be scaredTo be on you're ownWhen you see the leaves fallingBaby know that you can lean on meI can promise anythingYou've just got to trust me babyYou know, and I knowWe are standing on the edge of mysteryIf you jump, I jumpThat's the only way to set us freeFallJump in one, two, threeFallBaby this is whereBaby this is where you run awayBaby this is what you wanna beBaby this is where you run away, run awayBaby this is where you run awayBaby this is what you wanna beBaby this is where you run away, run awayBaby this is where you run awayBut this is what you wanna be, babyThis is where you run away Writer(s): Brandon Beal, Rasmus Hedegaard, Christopher Nissen, August Fenger, Lars Quang Exclusive offer Get up to 3 months of free music You will get 3 free months if you haven &# x27;t already used an Apple Music free trial Listen to any song with synced lyrics on your mobile ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Made with love  &  passion in Italy. ðŸŒŽ Enjoyed everywhere To personalize content, ads and provide a better experience we use cookies.
