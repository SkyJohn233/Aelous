t help it notafter bodyguard and a man called god that is since my early years my favouritefemale characters in cartoons were the beautiful and strong heroines i lovedbeautiful women but i couldn t fathom those fragile ones waiting for men sprotection i reckon i was born a feminist even when i was 5 and i watchedthe anime lady lady i liked lynn much more than the delicate and annoyingsarah i didn t know why before but then i did lynn was strong fearless andbold wait ya park chohwa are you writing yourmemoir now won t you focus on the task at hand for god s sake so han go eun too played such rolesin the two drama i watched by her despite her falling desperately in love withmen and all the drama that accompanied this she shone as the devoted andstrong woman i admired her in both with all might and shipped her with theguys she wanted achingly this actress is well known as afunny mother in most of the dramas she acts in the thing about her is that nomatter how she repeats the role she s cute and funny all the same i likedthat role by her in marriage not dating 7th grade civil servant my princess and goong there was nothing different to her roles a nagging wife and a funnymother she acted a rather different role in queen seon duk and i thoughtseriousness didn t suit her my favourite of her roles is in the infamous boys over flowers despite it being another one of her mothers roles i liked herthe best there she was so hilarious here we have one talented actresswho s not always lucky with her roles i would like to dismiss her heart to heart and maids roles from this article because they were not up to herabilities but when i think about it i stop the dramas always need such motherfigures not every drama emphasises them or gives them much time in bothdramas the characters started deeply and faded in the background later i wantedto know more about them but they ended just like that the reason i was disappointed isthat i watched this lady s performance in sunny the mind-blowing film she wasmarvellous and made me cry thoughout i loved her role and acting in surplus princess as well she was hilarious i don t really remember her in poseidon i think she was lee shi young 's mother but i do remember having a down on her in sad love story i justcouldn t i m going to wait to see a betterrole please it s been a long time since thisbeautiful actress started acting she mostly acts in family dramas so i haven tbeen lucky enough to watch much of her but i do have many of her works on mylist i saw her first in golden bride –myfirst 50-sth-episode family drama now she was an annoying character rich spoiled arrogant and bossy she acted the same role in what happens to my family but luckily she was funny in the latter rather hilarious i hated her guts inthe first and loved her to bits in the second in all about eve she acted asuperficial character as well and made me hate her by siding with the bad girl kim so yeon i m watching her now in jewel in the palace and she s presenting a great antagonist making me admire her more andmore she s also a trot singer and atalented one her adoptive daughters are also gifted i don t like this actress honestly i hate her but that doesn t mean she s not a beautiful and brilliant actresswho gets totally immersed in her roles it would have been hard for me tolike her when my first role by her was in goong she was completely hateful andi felt sorry for kim jeong hoon throughout i m also his fan so… but whatmade it impossible for me to like her was her second role and that was in endless love if you re one of those martyrs who endured and actually finishedthe drama you d understand what i mean shim hye jin gave a very real andpowerful performance of the power-possessed min hye rin she coupled up withevil personified jeong wung in and did everything a human being should not do.i still have no idea how i actually could make it till the end ah when iremember the disgust i felt at her actions that s why i couldn t like fathomor sympathise with her anywhere else neither in the spring day of my life kill me heal me nor south of the border she helped me settle my feelings withher bad role in secret love affair bad suits her well yoon yeo jeong was supposed to be included in the next part but here we have her specially for bluegrl95 yoon yeo jeong definitely deserves to be on this list she is an amazing actress no matter what her role is she always plays it extremely well and she is versatile too i agree i love this lady absolutely king2hearts did so many incurable things to me and introducing this lady was oneof them how superb how divine was her acting there as the queen mother istill remember the scenes when she got kidnapped with ha ji won and i stillget those goose bumps people she was 62 and kdrama fans know very well thatactresses her age only get evil and nagging mother-in-law roles well she didthat in king2hearts but in such an extraordinary way it s unforgettable am ifangirling too hard i 'm watching her now in pearl necklace and as annoying as her role is i 'm just loving her she 's so cute honorary mention i have to mention this lady though ihave only watched her once but that once made an impression on me i guess youfigured yes that was punch her character as the wolf in sheep s clothing wasintriguing throughout the drama i couldn t figure her out and i couldn t blamewhoever followed her she made me hate her at many moments but admire her atmost she played the role perfectly that role would keep her name in my mindfor a long time to come though i 've started bluebird house i 'm still in the first episode so i can not say much about her my drama eonni bmore is smitten by her though so i think i 'll like what i 'll see bdani loving this series it 's great to see so many amazing women over 40 i 'm so glad you are will work harder this is one actress whose role i don t remember after i finished the drama but i remember liking her there makes
