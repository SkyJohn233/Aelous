This year, a total of 39 classes will be participating in the camp held daily from 8 February 2011 to 19 March 2011. The camp commenced on 8 February 2011 and was attended by the first class from the School of Business and Services, Hair Sculpting class, together with its class advisor, Mr Steven Ang.  The camp was filled with fun and exciting activities to help the students to bond with their classmates and class advisor. Through the activities, the students learnt about the importance of communication, perseverance, building relationships, life skills and supporting each other in times of challenges and trials. These skills are important to help them through their journey here at College East and in the future. In addition to land activities, the camp also included water activities such as water relay and rafting   where the students were challenged to build their own raft to ferry 4 people across the pool several times. In the evening, there was a sharing session where students shared on their goals and aspirations. They learned about the importance of setting goals and having dreams so as to have a focus in their lives. The camp ended on the second day with a Telematch and all EDGE campers were rewarded with a Badge memento. Click  here  to view a video taken during the camp.
