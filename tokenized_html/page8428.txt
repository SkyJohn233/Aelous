an exchange with felicia furman the granddaughter of a prominent author of south carolina history i write about furman x2019 s background and the first half of the exchange in this column x201c prominent south carolina public schools history book author believed black people loved being called x2018 darkies x2019 x201d here x2019 s the second half bailey do others in your family feel the way

simply a fact however they are less vocal than i am about racism and reconciliation i chose a different path in 1993 i began a family history project that turned into the pbs film x201c shared history x201d during that time my parents and i started a scholarship fund for the descendants of the enslaved people at the plantation we owned it x2019 s called woodlands and is in bamberg county we still own part of the land that comprised the plantation which includes a two story house as my grandmother said the ruins of what sherman left behind and the white and black graveyards several families of freedmen stayed on the place after the civil war so i did genealogies of each of the families that i could trace back to slavery at woodlands so young people could prove their connection now i work with an organization called coming to the table whose members include the descendants of enslaved people and slave owners bailey your family s history can be traced back to fighting for the south in the civil war is it possible to legitimately separate the south s reason for going into the war from revering your ancestor s individual bravery and sacrifice why or why not furman we didn x2019 t hear stories about our ancestor fighting in the civil war but my grandmother told a story about an enslaved person named jupiter who went with my great-grandfather to the battle lines he was quoted as saying to my great grandfather x201c you got to be brave but not too brave x201d i don x2019 t think you can separate the south x2019 s reason for going into the war from revering your ancestor x2019 s participation i think you can only acknowledge the bravery and sacrifice of any young person in a battle you have to accept your ancestors for who they were the good and the bad i would say revere is too strong a word for how my family feels about our ancestor fighting in the civil war his father william gilmore simms was the focus of the family x2019 s attention he was a writer and spoke out strongly in favor of slavery my grandmother published his letters in nine volumes bailey tell me a bit more about your great-grandfather and the role he played in the war and before the war furman my great-grandfather was 18 when he entered the war there is very little we know about his role in the war or his childhood bailey what effect has the flying of the confederate flag had on this state for the past half century furman the flag is a symbol of hatred whether white people believe it or not it x2019 s flown to show the perceived superiority of whites so it x2019 s a slap in the face of african-americans bailey how do you think the events of this past week a massacre in a black church followed by a complete about-face by top legislators about the confederate flag will ultimately play out will this be a momentary change with a shift back to things as they were once the emotion dies down or does this have the making of lasting change that matters furman i think the massacre and the removal of the flag will have lasting change i think for a certain segment of the population the unconscious whites it will be a wakeup call important leaders are supporting its removal they will pay attention to that for the demonic and vile of the population it may send them further underground but there will always be another who will play out his beliefs pushed on by mental illness the only good thing that has come out of this is that another conversation has been started maybe it x2019 s just another conversation that goes nowhere but i think it will have impact on those uncommitted people in a choice to face the racism that continues to harm our country bailey you are in colorado how do folks there view south carolina and the flag do you think that will change if it actually is removed furman my associates in colorado think south carolina is a joke however they are intrigued by the mythologies of the old south i don x2019 t think taking down the flag will cause any change of feeling in colorado by issac j. bailey when the rev franklin graham talks about christians he s not referring to me even though i grew up in the southern christian church and have the born again bona
