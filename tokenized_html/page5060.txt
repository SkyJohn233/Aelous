concentrates are potential as functional food ingredient introduction millet is a general term for a wide range of cereals the name millet is used to describe seeds from several taxonomically divergent species of grass they are grown mostly in marginal areas and under agricultural conditions in which major cereals fail to give substantial yields fao 2008 millets are thought to have been among the first cultivated crops being one of the stable foods in central eastern asia europe mainly in china india and russia and some parts in africa during the early ages baltensperger 1996 it is grown quite extensively in india though not of major importance as a food crop they form the major source of energy and protein for millions of people of low income group in asia and africa millets are classified with maize sorghum and coix job s tears in the grass sub-family panicoideae it is an important food in many developing countries because of its ability to grow under adverse wheather conditions like limited rainfall foxtail millet setaria italica l. is also known as italian millet foxtail millet is one of the world s oldest cultivated crops its cultivation is estimated to have started over 4000 years ago chang 1987 it is one of the most important food crops of the neolithic culture in china in india foxtail millet is grown primarily in the hot drought b prone arid and semiarid zones and used mostly for food purposes especially by people with low income foxtail millet is ranked as second in the world s total production of millets and is an important staple food for millions of people in europe and asia marathee 1993 foxtail millet is an important cereal and nutritious food in traditional diets especially for people on the europe asia and africa continents the main components of millet include starch protein lipid vitamins and minerals usha et al 1996 it was further reported that minerals like magnesium manganese and phosphorus were significantly in higher amount than the others gopalan et al 1987 millet in general contains significant quantity of essential amino acid s particularly the sulphur contain amino acid s methionine and cysteine it is also higher in fat content than maize rice and sorghum obilana and manyasa 2002 it contains 12.3 crude protein and 3.3 minerals vithal and machewad 2006 the seed protein from millet is responsible for up to 50 of the dry weight of the entire seed and makes a significant contribution to their processing properties and nutritional quality shewry and halford 2002 although millions of hectares of millet are harvested worldwide providing good source of protein for over 500 million people yet still little is known about its important seed storage proteins virk and mangat 1997 as millets differ from one another by their appearance taste grain quality and morphological behavior their bio chemical composition will also be different in a broad sense for example the major storage protein of foxtail millet is alcohol soluble prolamins monterio et al 1988 whereas in kodo millet and barnyard millet the alkali soluble glutelin forms the major storage protein as reported by sudharshana et al 1988 and monterio et al 1988 although chemical composition and nutritive value s of foxtail millet have been reported monteiro et al 1982 little information is available on the extraction characterization and nutritional properties of foxtail millet grown in china these two varieties of foxtail millet yellow and white are used in most traditional homes in africa europe and asia but no comprehensive study has been done simultaneously to show their similarities and differences therefore the main objective of this study were to extract characterize study the nutritional differences between the two varieties of foxtail and analyzed the amino acid composition molecular weight distribution of the subunits and their thermal properties materials and methods the two varieties of foxtail millet white and yellow were purchased from a local market in wuxi people s republic of china all chemicals used in the experiments were of analytical grade the foxtail millet 1 kg was defatted twice with hexane

0.05 was considered for significant difference each value was determined by at least three replicates results were given as mean sd results and discussion proximate chemical composition the proximate chemical composition of the various varieties fmfw fmfy dfmfw and dfmfy was not significantly different p 0.05 to each other table 1 after defatting the protein content for fmfw increased though not significantly different p 0.05 11.50 b 11.92 while the protein content for the fmfy after defatting decreased 11.41- 11.39 the removal of the fat from foxtail millet did not significantly affect the protein content in foxtail millet nonetheless our results corroborated the results reported for kodo millet sudharshana et al 1988 before defatting the fat content for fmfw and fmfy was 2.38 and 2.90 respectively but a significant decrease p 0.05 was observed for dfmfw and dfmfy 0.41 and 0.66 respectively the fat content was relatively low when compared to pearl millet 7.6 and quinoa 6.3 oshodi and ogungbenle 1999 it was also observed that the carbohydrates content was significantly higher for all the samples table 1 the results from this study were within the range reported for other samples studied amado and arrigoni 1992 other researchers found that the carbohydrates were mainly composed of sugars sucrose and raffinose fibers pentosans and starch in wheat germs amado and arrigoni 1992 fractionation of defatted millet protein the results of the extracted protein fractions from defatted millet shows that the protein content fractions albumin globulin glutelin and prolamin in dfmfw and dfmfy revealed that prolamin is the major storage protein in the foxtail millet table 2 the content varied from 41 and 77.5 of the total protein among the varieties next to glutelins present resulted supported parvathy and thayumanavan 1995 who stated that prolamin and glutelin are the predominant protein fractions in millet and sorghum however in sorghum pearl millet and finger millet prolamins and glutelins are present in almost equal amounts and constitute two major storage protein fractions tatham et al 1996 and chandna and matta 1990 a large amount of carbohydrates and pigments were extracted into the albumin and globulin fractions this might be the reason for their low protein content the total protein fractions amounted to 75.6 and 59.9 w/w of the total protein content for both white and yellow foxtail millet fractions this result shows a significant difference p 0.05 the alcohol soluble prolamin accounted for 25.5 and 38.8 of the total proteins among the two varieties white and yellow which was higher than that in wheat flour and rice padhye and salunkhe 1979 wrigley and bietz 1988 the salt-soluble and alkali-soluble fractions for glutelin for both white and yellow were 47.2 and 16.2 respectively while globulin for white and yellow as 1.4 and 2.3 respectively the results are lower than those of wrigley and bietz 1988 when they reported on the protein fractions and amino acid s in wheat flour albumin globulin prolamine and glutelin when compared with the reported values the relative proportion of prolamin was higher while globulin was lower wrigley and bietz 1988 these differences may be due to millet cultivars extracting procedures and meal preparation methods furthermore the protein concentrates obtained had a protein content of 56 and 63 for dfmfw and dfmfy respectively this result was significantly difference p 0.05 prolamin and glutelin the predominant protein fractions in dfmfw and dfmfy could also be the main protein fractions of the protein concentrate therefore the preparation of protein concentrate would be an effective method for recovering proteins from defatted millet flour amino acid composition the amino acid composition of the four fractions and their protein concentrates of the two varieties of millet dfmfw and dfmfy were observed to have similar amino acid composition and no significant difference was found among the two varieties table 3 the amino acid patterns of the defatted flours were in close agreement with the values reported for pearl millet and sorghum ejeta et al 1987 amino acid analysis revealed that millet protein is rich in glutamic acid leucine and alanine in addition aspartic acid and lysine were high in the fractions of the two varieties with the exception of prolamin which is deficient in lysine similar to other cereal present results were in agreement with values reported by ejeta et al 1987 and asiedu et al 1993 but lower than values reported from sudan by el-tinay et al 1979 neucere and sumrell 1980 indicated that low content of lysine in millet is attributed to the high content of prolamin fraction in most varieties dfmfw and dfmfy their fractions and protein concentrates have a well-balanced amino acid composition moreover most of the essential amino acid s in the protein fractions and protein concentrates were higher than the reference pattern recommended by fao/who/unu 1985 it was observed from table 3 that leucine and phenylalanine tyrosine are in excess amounts in millet protein lysine is the first limiting amino acid cereal as it was observed to be low in the present study cysteine was lacking in millet protein this fact indicates that s-s bonds would be absent in millet protein compared with dfmfw and dfmfy isoleucine valine tyrosine methionine alanine phenylalanine leucine and histidine were extracted in great proportion while a loss of the content of tryptophan cystine threonine arginine and proline was observed in protein concentrates the loss of tryptophan is probably due to mild acid treatment in the preparation process of protein concentrate whereas the lower contents of threonine and arginine may have been caused by alkaline processing which can cause destruction of cystine threonine arginine serine and lysine monique et al 1975 therefore effectively controlling the ph value is very important during protein concentrate preparation the amino acid composition of protein concentrate is generally in accordance with earlier reported by ge et al 2001 except for the higher contents of methionine leucine alanine and aspartic acid and the lower level of arginine isoleucine lysine and glutamic acid in our concentrate among the four protein fractions prolamin contained the lowest amount of tryptophan and sulfur-containing amino acid s. also prolamine had the lowest amount of lysine the prolamin and glutelin fractions had better-balanced amino acid patterns when compared with the globulin and albumin fractions therefore prolamin the predominant fraction of dfmfw and dfmfy were the best for healthy food formulation classifications of amino acid s in different groups according to chemical properties are shown in table 4 among the four protein fractions and protein concentrates of the two varieties globulins yellow and prolamin white fractions contained the highest amount of sulfur-containing amino acid s globulin yellow and albumin white have the highest amount of basic amino acid s whereas hydrophobic and aromatic amino acid s content were the lowest while the sulfur-containing amino acid s in globulin fraction were the lowest the prolamine fractions of both varieties contained the highest amount of acidic amino acid s whereas the content of uncharged polar amino acid s was found to be very low in prolamin yellow and globulin white the glutelin yellow and globulin white have the lowest amount of acidic amino acid s. the globulin yellow and prolamin white have the highest total aromatic amino acid s. there was no significant difference between four protein fractions of both varieties compared with their protein concentrate and the defatted flour differential scanning calorimetry dsc differential scanning calorimetry is a rapid easy and capable technique for supplying both thermodynamic heat capacity enthalpy and entropy and kinetic data reaction rate and activation energy on protein denaturation and has been used extensively in various food systems dsc has been used to study the thermal properties and structural changes of proteins reaker and johnson 1995 this method is highly sensitive to conformational changes gorinstein et al 1996 the information on protein thermal properties is useful for food-processing strategies and heat-processing design ju et al 2001 data from dsc measurements for prolamin globulin albumin glutelin and the protein concentrate for dfmfw and dfmfy are given table 5 according to the results the samples have varied denaturation temperatures 77.051 72.100 79.583 66.682 75.528 79.398 70.820 79.206 77.383 and 71.476 c respectively the samples showed progressively lower enthalpies with increasing outlet temperatures the enthalpy did not differ significantly among the various fractions wang et al 1999 reported that the denaturation temperature and enthalpy changes were 83.4 c and 0.96 j g -1 for rice bran protein concentrate the enthalpies of the various samples as stated above were 0.028 2.288 5.115 0.313 0.272 0.022 0.291 0.047 0.019 and 0.045 c respectively in this study the various fractions where less denatured than similar product reported by wang et al 1999 except glutelin from foxtail millet flour white that is higher than the reported value wang et al 1999 however the denaturation temperature of the millet globulin fraction was generally consistent with previous findings 84-96 77 and 88 c for oats globulin harwalkar and ma 1987 in addition our results for the globulin fraction are close to the reported values as compared with other cereal proteins harwalkar and ma 1987 the result shows that albumin of millet was more heat-sensitive than rice 73.3 c and oat 87 c albumins whereas the enthalpy of millet globulin was lower than those 3.14 j g -1 and 5.39 cal g -1 of rice and oat globulins ma and harwalkar 1984 ju et al 2001 .thus the structural properties of defatted foxtail millet protein fractions and protein concentrates will be significantly affected if during their preparation the temperature exceed 80 c this will denature the proteins sds page analysis sds-page analysis of the fractions and their concentrates are shown in fig 1a and b there is a streaking in the patterns of the proteins of the fractions and protein concentrates among the two varieties albumin and globulin fractions revealed polypeptides of a wide range of molecular weights a low protein variety the fractions were found to have a higher concentration of low-molecular weight polypeptides several bands were seen at 97.4 66.2 43.0 35.0 and 20.0 kda among the two varieties this is contrary to kodo millet and barnyard millet which have only four components of albumin and globulin in the range 14.0-32.0 kda monteiro et al 1988 the sds -page of prolamins fig 1a and b lane 5 and 6 showed a slight variation among the varieties four prominent bands were seen two below 31.0 kda 20 kda 14.0 kda and one prominent band was also seen below 14.0 kda lane 5 fig 1a this is similar to the report that prolamins were distributed within the molecular weight range of 27-13 kda and four to five bands appeared within that range parvathy and thayumanavan 1995 nonetheless however only two bands appeared within that range in fig 1b lane 6 on the contrary maize contains 10 different polypeptides in the prolamin fraction chandna and matta 1990 the sds-page of glutelins fig 1a and b revealed many bands throughout the length of the gel and showed no variation among the selected foxtail millet varieties the sds-page of the protein concentrates fig 1a and b also revealed that many bands run throughout the length of the gel and showed no variation among the yellow and white foxtail millet conclusion the defatted foxtail millet flour for both varieties contains a moderate amount of protein furthermore the results of the protein characteristics show that millet protein fractions and protein concentrates have potential as a functional food ingredient the essential amino acid pattern of foxtail millet proteins fractions and their concentrates suggests their possible use as a supplementary protein source to most cereals because this protein is rich in lysine which is the 1st limiting amino acid for most cereals they had varied denaturation temperatures and the fractions were found to have a higher concentration of low molecular weight polypeptides the combined protein fractions and protein concentrates could be used as protein ingredients in food
