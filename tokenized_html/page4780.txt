chesterbrook i was undoubtedly heartbroken as i would be leaving my friends and family behind in philadelphia however after having spent a year living within chesterbrook i can say it is one of the safest neighborhoods i have lived in the area is very family friendly has amazing schools and full of color however with great areas come downfalls the lack of diversity within the area is quite disappointing coming from a mid suburban area the area is also extremely costly due to the conditions of chesterbrook and is amazing school district making it difficult to give it a 5/5 rating read 47
