has all been on deandra dottin s batting in the lead-up to this icc women s world t20 2018 and then she goes and makes a statement with the ball on the opening day of the tournament reminding everyone why she s one of the most feared all-rounders of the game deandra you have two t20i hundreds do you have a special goal for this tournament i do have a special goal scoring more centuries as well i have two more coming for sure. two more coming for this tournament yes please. it was the second time in a week that deandra dottin the windies women all-rounder was coolly stating her intention to bring up a couple of hundreds as if they were as easy as finding a party in the caribbean but dismiss her ambition at your own peril for ever so often the party tends to come to dottin back in 2010 in the second edition of the women s world t20 and the first held in the caribbean dottin kicked off the tournament by becoming the first woman to score a t20i century when she smashed 112* off 45 balls her hundred coming from just 38 deliveries is still the quickest in the women s game then last year she became the first woman with two twenty20 international hundreds against her name when she repeated the feat against the touring sri lankans with other batters from around the world quickly catching up in the power-hitting game and the bar in women s cricket being constantly raised dottin who says she is driven by the competition threw down another gauntlet at the guyana national stadium on friday 9 november she became the first woman to have a t20i century and a five-wicket haul to her credit this is a modal window this is a modal window this modal can be closed by pressing the escape key or activating the close button jersey no.5 's 5-5 against bangladesh – incidentally also on the opening day of the tournament like in 2010 – are the third-best figures in women s t20is i ve been working hard on my game setting goals for myself she told the icc in a chat for me it s to take the team as far as i can. at one point dottin used to call herself the female chris gayle – her words not ours the comparison fits for more than a shared ability to thwack the long ball it s also in that supreme self-assurance – confident but not over-confident as dottin puts it – and a swagger for dottin that serious swagger sometimes melts into fits of laughter and you see glimpses of the person behind the attitude before she collects herself into a poker face again moving in faith which is something many in the team live by – it means putting god first in everything you do – is important to her and the team is her family on friday she claimed there were absolutely no concerns about how the team were kept to 106/8 on a ground that had seen harmanpreet kaur make almost that much all by herself earlier in the day but to see them come out pumped up and give the georgetown crowd something to cheer about exposed the fallacy of that sentiment to some extent it was a team with a point to prove and dottin helped them do it you could see what it meant in the vigour with which she celebrated this is a modal window this is a modal window this modal can be closed by pressing the escape key or activating the close button she beat the bangladesh batters for pace and got movement on a tiring pitch never one to shirk from sending down the short ones she kept the batters on their toes her celebration dance was inspired by a song from ciara called level up it s an apt metaphor for her world t20 ambition that s the good thing about being an all-rounder she told press-persons after her record when you do n't pick up in one area you can pick up in the next i did n't pick up with the bat so i knew that being one of the main bowlers i have to come through with the ball. what s helped dottin 'level up is an increased emphasis on fitness it s not only about hitting all the boundaries and big sixes and stuff running between the wickets is also crucial as well so in that also fitness fills the basket she told icc like i said this is some historymaking cricket to close out the first day of the 2018 wt20 dottin_5 delivers an unbelievable spell of bowling to lead the windieswomen to victory congrats again dee 5for6 we have been working the past couple of months on my fitness doing sprints intervals a lot of speed work i mostly used to do long distance and short sprints i added some intervals she said it helps you concentrate a lot as well. dottin is charged up and ready to go and if she is to be believed more records are on the way this tournament has seen her go back to the top of the order in an attempt to give her team explosive starts so the possibility is very real it wasn t any pressure before i don t think there s any pressure now it s just a matter of me playing a little more freely she signs off
