san pedro de atacama wikitravel san pedro de atacama is a town in northern chile it 's a very popular destination among chilean tourists and international visitors alike visitors come in large numbers to use the town as a stepping stone to the amazing landscapes around it most attractions are part of the los flamencos national reserve perhaps chile 's most varied and amazing national park prices in any of the laid back bars and restaurants fare well against santiago 's chile 's capital still it 's a fairly expensive location as it 's one of chile 's three most popular destinations along torres del paine and easter island of note many roads are unpaved buildings are single story and the town feels a bit like in a western movie it is not a resort several buses per day connect the town with calama operated by frontera del norte atacama 2000 turbus and ktur the trip takes about 1 hour and 30 minutes and costs 3.000 pesos other buses from turbus travel to and from antofagasta 4 hours 6000 iquique arica 12 hours 22.000 pesos and santiago bus passes are available from the green toad bus 3 which allow you to travel to san pedro from argentina brazil peru bolivia and santiago and from other websites three bus lines connect the town with purmamarca jujuy and salta geminis andesmar and pullman bus the prices float around 60 usd 30,000 pesos and all of them leave from san pedro three times per week other choices can be found in calama but it might defeat the point a little since you 'll go through san pedro in any case frontera del norte runs direct buses from and to uyuni the trip takes approximately 10 hours frontera del norte connects calama and uyuni ask the office in san pedro if uyuni requires a connection in calama no airline flies directly to san pedro the nearest commercial airport is el loa in calama cjc three airlines serve it latam sky airline and jetsmart most flights connect calama with santiago but a few also fly to antofagasta and iquique there are two flights to concepcion two flights to la serena and one flight to lima a two-way ticket can be had for as little as usd 26 to travel between the airport and san pedro you have two choices taxi airport calama 7,000 pesos and bus calama san pedro see beginning of section or 100 minutes hotel transfer with transvip transferpampa or licancabur which charge a fare of 12,000 they are online and have booths in the airport beware that while both calama and san pedro are about 2500m altitude the road between them will lift you up till 3400m especially if you just came from a much lower altitude like flew from santiago to calama there is a real risk for altitude sickness consider spending a few days at calama first chile is well-known as a hitchhikers paradise getting to calama from any other point in the country is simple enough but reaching san pedro is a bit trickier the best chances are to be had at the topater monolith monolito de topater from there walk south beyond the underpass and hitch a ride to town you might have to wait for a while but traffic to and from calama is fairly consistent sometimes even the vans of tourist agencies might pick you up it all depends on your luck bring lots of water it is indeed the desert and you could spend a long time out there once in the town nearly all points of interest restaurants services are within walking distance with the exception of a few outlying hotels downtown comprises twelve small blocks between the streets domingo atienza and toconao from west to east and licancabur and caracoles north to south this last street is the main one a pedestrian zone be aware that since mid-2010 it 's now forbidden to ride a bike in it if you look gringo enough chances are the cops will let you slide-but it 's advised not to try they 're fond of ticketing cyclists in the evening.if you ca n't find what you need in the aforementioned twelve blocks chances are you wo n't get it anywhere.bike rentals are ubiquitous and prices vary little most bike rentals will lend you a headlight if you ask but make sure the bike also has a tail reflector and wear a helmet ask also an emergency kit for the bikes and a map of the valley kilometro 0 has good bikes caracoles street prices 3500 for 6 hours 6000 for the whole day it can pay to rent a bike to visit the pukara de quitor aldea de tulor valle de la luna and even laguna cejar all of these are described in the next chapter.taxis charge 2500 clp to suburbian hotels you can rent a car in san pedro 75000 clp for pickup car or at the calama airport an international driving permit is not required although if your license is not in english or spanish it would not hurt to have one rentals are cheaper in antofagasta but the drive to san pedro is long about four hours most popular destinations are fairly easy to reach with a good map though be careful with altitude sickness as many of the roads out of san pedro de atacama quickly climb up to above 4000 meters the main roads between towns are all in good paved condition some expeditions around san pedro de atacama have poor quality roads and you will at the very least want a car with high clearance if you want to drive south of socaire e.g to laguna miscanti the road to the argentine border at paseo jama is paved and modern as is the road to the valley of the moon the road to the geysers del tatio is paved but in poor condition but it is no trouble to drive in a small 2 wheel drive with poor clearance driving offroads e.g to salar de tara is ill-advised unless you have a good 4x4 and know how to use it cell phone reception is generally good but you do n't want to be caught out of reception with a flat tire and no water always travel with a full tank since the only gas station in the area is in san pedro you may find unlicensed fuel vendors in some of the smaller towns like toconao but they charge outrageous prices check the condition of all tires even the spare flat tires are n't at all unusual on the many dirt roads that lead to points of interest there are three essential places to visit plus a host of other very interesting spots in order of popularity these are located at 4,200m above sea level and 100km away from town these are some of the highest geysers in the world it 's also the third-largest geyser site on earth with over 80 active ones most agencies travel there at 4 am so as to arrive at sunrise the spectacle is hard to forget-even if the geysers themselves are smallish the backdrop lighting and sheer variety are astounding usually you get to see them from the first stages of dawn an hour before the sun rises until sunlight bathes them completely the best time to take pictures is at exact sunrise but other lightings can also create wonderful pictures all respectable tour agencies include breakfast for their guests if you book one that does n't then you 've been scammed if you have rented a car please note that the site closes at 17:00 h.on the way back it 's typical to find wild vicuñas an endangered andean camelid that 's highly protected in chile they were rescued from the verge of extinction thirty years ago vicuñas in the area are accustomed to human presence and will tolerate tourists coming to some twenty meters away any more and they 're likely to flee be extremely respectful of the regulations for many guides and drivers might even react in an aggressive manner if you bother the animals in any way.a common stop is the fording of the putana river a spectacle that for some even surpasses the geysers themselves many different bird species inhabit it and it 's perfectly possible to get very close to them-giant coots fulica gigantea are especially indolent winter has the most birds with over ten different species cohabiting the place at peak migration but temperatures are harsh there 's also the possibility of seeing a vizcacha or two lagidium viscacia a funny mix between a bunny a squirrel and a kangaroo they 're very shy though and if you do n't get there among the first visitors they 'll have usually disappeared in the background to the east lies the putana volcano-an active mountain that boasts seven small fumes.lastly there 's usually the choice of visiting one of two locations the first one is machuca an abandoned altiplanic village that lived from the mining of sulpher most regular tours stop here nowadays you 'll find a few locals there roasting anticuchos made of llama meat teas soft drinks and empanadas are also available the meat is of questionable origins with some wild theories as to its origin floating around ask your guide for a laugh it 's fairly safe to consume though as sanitation 's decent just after exiting machuca it 's common to see llamas grazing on a beautiful pasture after that pasture lies a micro-sized salt pan where vicuñas and james flamingos can be seen the latter only in summer though .the other location is puritama see below .if you plan on going please consider the following things entrance fee 3000 2500 if you arrive before noon chilean peso the tours wo n't include it .the office opens at 9 am there is nothing stopping a bike from entering before the offices open but do support this incredible site by buying a entry ticket there is a beautiful mirador viewpoint off the paved road to calama that can be reached by car or bike this is around km 83 you 'll see a small hut off the road head towards the rocks that were put there to simulate chairs and tables there is a bit a climbing with the bike from san pedro if the road incline is down for a significant duration then you have passed the viewpoint this viewpoint is quite a bit after from the turnoff to valle de la luna this is a beautiful viewpoint to see both the sunset and the sunrise hardly anybody is there for the sunrise a little bit of walking away from this point is a spiral maze i walked in and out the spiral to make a wish commonly advertised as 'moon valley in english this part of the salt mountain range offers stunning clinal and anticlinal formations in a perfectly barren landscape almost all tours include watching the sunset there-you should n't miss it the large stone walls resemble those of the grand canyon in arizona sans river there are also huge halite rock salt strata that produce a knacking sound all day long this can be unsettling at first but it 's actually harmless among its prime attractions are the grand crater the salt canyon the three maries and salt mines the salt caves the cari viewpoint also called 'piedra del coyote this location is off the road to calama and not actually in the valle de luna and valle de la muerte death valley all tours visit a number of these but it 's virtually impossible to know which beforehand summer tours tend to be longer though and therefore have a greater probability of including more destinations it 's perfectly possible to ride a bike there but you should take your time the full bike tour to the end of the park a place called 'tres marias is 17km from there you can add another 2km return by taking the road to the left to a spooky salt mine over a seriously bad road the other roads are pretty good tarmac to the park office 6km from san pedro then 5km on good dirt to the checkpoint after that the only nasty climb of the day when biking it 's advised to travel early think 7-8 am in the morning for afternoon temperatures can be suffocating year-round you miss the sunset but also lessen the possibility of heatstroke and the sightseeings wo n't be filled with tourists also it 's easier to find someone to rescue you if you get in trouble most drivers and guides are willing to help stranded cyclists especially if they 're female or if you travel with one just do n't expect them to carry a retinue of ten or so tired bikers you should get a flashlight especially if you want to watch sunset the road can be dangerous when dark but also because there 's a cave you can visit and it 's pitch black in there if you plan on going please consider the following feel like visiting the atacama salt pan a picturesque village and some alp-lookalikes in a single day plus eating some local food then this is your thing usually advertised as 'altiplanic lagoons the tour varies very little if at all between agencies you 'll be visiting the village of toconao renowned for its church and bell-tower laguna chaxa a national reservation which three species of flamingos inhabit year-round located at the heart of the atacama salt pan miscanti and miñiques lagoons located above 4,000m and home to a variety of local fauna and socaire a tiny hamlet that lives from selling lunch to tourists-it usually includes home-grown potatoes big beans carrots and quinoa plus a few other things there are two differents tours one from 7am to 2pm with breakfast but no lunch ch 20,000 to 30,000 or another leaving town at 8am and returning at 5pm including lunch in socaire ch 30,000 on sept 2014 if you plan on going please consider the following there 's still much more to be found in the san pedro area from the secluded national reservation at aguas de quelana to the ghastly surface of the salar de ascotán to the most advanced radio-telescopes in the world at alma there 's enough sights for half a lifetime if you are a returning visitor or someone who loves to see what almost no one else has seen and you get offered a visit to somesuch place then take it albeit being a tourist attraction for thirty years san pedro de atacama is still full of mystery and wonder entrance fee 15.000 clp this is one amazing location in summer set in the northern tip of the atacama salt pan this location offers a splendid panorama of the andes and the possibility to bathe in waters as salty as those of the dead sea the landscape 's also remarkable it usually ends with sunset along a simple cocktail with pisco sour the tour sets off at variable times since chile follows dst but always in the afternoon around 3-4 pm besides the cejar and piedra lagoons excursions usually stop by the 'ojos del salar eyes of the salt pan two freshwater eyes very close together and lake tebenquinche a water mirror that offers the absolute best sunsets in the whole area-imagine the mountains slowly changing colors from yellow to pink and that same image reflected on the lake 's perfect surface you can get there by bike but bear in mind that it 's a long ride 50km for the round-trip with the sun burning your scalp without any mercy there are shorter paths but the safest is the main road to get there just ask where the customs 'aduana are and then travel south until you see a sign that reads 'laguna cejar the road 's paved and drivers are accustomed to see bikers on it wear bright clothing red blue and yellow work best just in case you should n't have any trouble locating it for there are other signs along the way if you 'd like to visit the other lagoons besides piedra and cejar you can try asking the employee at cejar 's entry spanish is required though unfortunately no maps show the paths between cejar and the others but a simple compass can get you there-ride south following the tracks of the agencies vehicles again bring a flashlight .if you plan on going please consider the following there are two ways to get here either by booking a specialty tour or by taking a different el tatio geysers route they 're commonly called 'hot springs but that name could n't be more of a misnomer the puritama means 'hot water in kunza is actually a warm river that breaks loose from the stone a few meters away from the actual place water temperature usually is around 33ºc it is amazingly clear and pure and hosts a budding population of rainbow trout do n't worry they 're tiny and harmless the hot springs are property of hotel explora a five-star brand located in all of chile 's hot spots the facilities are basic yet elegant and extremely functional the entry fee 's something to watch out for 15.000 pesos 25 usd if you can spare the money you wo n't regret it the landscape 's stunning and the water perfect ancient agricultural terraces line the canyon-sides along with massive stone walls and even some cacti.the layout of the place is as follows there are eight artificial pools cleverly made with volcanic rocks so that they mesh perfectly with the scenery guides and drivers typically recommend the fourth and fifth ones unless you 're there early forget about them go for the seventh the water 's just a little bit colder but the pool 's very large and has sizable waterfall that doubles as a hydro-massage.if you plan on going please consider the following in spanish it 's called 'tour arqueologico it usually comprises three destinations pukara de quitor aldea de tulor and the r.p gustavo le paige archaeological museum closed since 2015 some exhibits can be visited from 15 to 18 hours next to the cemetery pukara de quitor is an ancient fortress most likely built in the tenth century entry is 2,500 and can be reached easily by bicycle before continuing on through garganta del diablo the garganta del diablo by bike is not to be missed it is an excellent excursion you can do by yourself bring fresh legs and plenty of water and you 'll be rewarded by beautiful views it 's quite close to san pedro only 4km away by dirt road and fording one creek the view from the summit is breathtaking aldea de tulor is the oldest village in the atacama basin approx 3,000 years old and kept in pristine condition it 's part of the los flamencos national reservation and has small exhibits on archeology worthless and local flora and fauna worth a visit last but not least is the museum it held a decent collection of original atacameño pieces along with some acquired by the ancient inhabitants of san pedro through trade these were most exotic the main exhibit was only in spanish though.you can visit these places by cycling or even on foot most bike rentals will give you a map of the area it should clearly point out where the pukara is getting to tulor however is a tad tricky you must look for signs in the most unlikely places wall graffiti stuff hung from trees and street names.if you plan on going please consider the following like most deserts atacama has its share of dunes and sand-banks the most popular is located in valle de la muerte death valley all sandboarding tours will take you there the dune is almost 100m in height still the typical track is barely a fraction of that some of them offer also to watch sunset in the moon valley-but be aware that you wo n't visit any of its spots except the great dune or the cari viewpoint.if you plan on going please consider the following it 's perhaps san pedro 's best-kept secret or not it really depends on your interests the road is long but well-paved until you reach the entrance to the most remote part of the los flamencos national reservation monjes de la pacana pacana monks the place is well above 4,500m-consider it carefully as it 's not uncommon for people to get altitude-sickness after that it 's a visit to some peculiar stone formations obsidian quarries more stone towers called 'catedrales and the huge tara salt lake fauna is abundant and particular to that environment the landscape is stunning at all times-it 's easy to catch glimpses of bolivia here and there as well traffic is light as this destination 's not really popular if that matters to you then taking this tour is the perfect way of saying i was off the beaten track of san pedro de atacama the schedule 's a lot more flexible than in other tours so harass the driver and guide as much as you like there are a few optional treks along the way but they 're difficult to attempt you 'll be feeling shortness of breath almost at once.if you plan on going please consider the following or rainbow valley it features three different parts all of them interesting the hierbas buenas petroglyph site is the first featuring over a thousand ancient stone carvings from the ancient atacameño people they 're from all time periods from the first caravaners to the incas most tours just visit sites 1 and 2 but that should be enough to afford a pretty nifty panorama of these ancient people 's history the other four sites are of difficult access.then you 've got the village of matancilla which is only habited according to season if you go there in winter be assured you 'll find it deserted the inhabitants grow a variety of crops which are easily distinguished all through autumn dead wild donkeys are all too common on the side of the road while goats and llamas are harder to spot.finally you 've got the namesake for the place the ever-stunning rainbow valley a series of hills that display countless colors from white to black from blue to red usually all tours visit two of the four roads available where the best views are to be had the cathedrals and the great valley next to the former to the left side are some ever-mysterious buildings made partially of serpentine which gives them a light green color they 're well-camouflaged so you 'll have to climb to actually see them on the way back from these cathedrals there 's a beautiful hill that displays a wealth of colors if the guide does n't offer you to walk down the slope ask for it it 's certainly worthwhile.you can watch a similar spectacle in argentina on the cerro de siete colores but you 'll miss the petroglyphs it might be worth it to rather book a tour in san pedro especially since most tourists are completely oblivious of the rainbow valley 's existence so you 'll most likely be alone when you visit.most of the advice given for other excursions applies here the environs of san pedro de atacama sport a large variety of mountains to climb catering to many levels of difficulty there 's a few specialized agencies that offer this kind of service be sure that they provide all necessaries not only asking the clerk but also the driver and guide an oxygen tank and climbing rods are the least you should expect.the easiest mountains to climb are cerro toco 5604m and volcán lascar 5510m -they 're fairly popular and take no longer than a day to complete higher in difficulty are cerro pili 6064m and sairecabur 5971m the beautiful licancabur volcano which towers over the town is a real challenge although only 5916m high it takes at least three days to complete not counting an exacting preparation period another choice is the kimal mountain 4276m even when its altitude is not that impressive it 's surrounded in myth and legend according to local folklore the princess kimal is extremely jealous and enjoys snatching adventurers away there 's even a supposed season for climbing her when she 's more pleasant of course no agency will tell ever you this beforehand take the chance at your own risk should you attempt any mountain climb in any case you ought to be well aware of the potential risks atacama desert is one of the best place on earth to see the sky many tours offer a unique experience in watching them they start with an explanation of the naked eye sky what is a constellation how to learn them how to read a sky map and recognize the main stars they explain to you why there are differently coloured skies etc then you look through the telescopes so it is possible to see saturn other galaxies and a lot of other phenomenons out there the tours ends with a warm drink the tours depart between 20:30 and 23:15 and last 2-4 hours as you are in the desert and the nights are pretty cold take warm clothes with you go within a week of the new moon moon phases otherwise most stars are drowned cost 30-180 us there are many hostals for all budgets in san pedro note that all are more expensive than in bolivia and overpriced given how touristic the town is.be careful of giving your credit card details over the phone to ¨guarantee¨a reservation you can rest assured there 's virtually no violent crime in san pedro extra care is advised when arriving at the bus terminal early morning as easy targets are spotted by bag thiefs the theft of bicycles and cars happens every once in a while so take the normal precautions in that regard despite being poorly lit at night the town is safe to walk around at all times-use your common sense if you see something suspicious you might hear locals say that the only danger in town are stray dogs leading even to the nickname san perro de atacama perro means dog in spanish and this is true san pedro boasts a huge population of them most are friendly and harmless but a few will attempt to bite passing cyclists rape is not unheard of in san pedro therefore it 's best practice for women to exercise caution especially at parties where alcohol is involved first of all always remember that the the altitude of san pedro de atacama is 2400m about 8000 feet above sea level many of the tourist attractions are well above 4000m 12000 feet this especially includes tours to salar de uyuni as it is a multi-day trip where you will be above 3500 meters the entire time including the first night sleeping at around 4300 meters symptoms of ams acute mountain sickness are very common especially if you only spend a day or two in san pedro before going on to uyuni symptoms include headache dizziness nausea loss of appetite and shortness of breath in particular sleeping at high altitudes is difficult for most people and you may wake up gasping for breath with a racing pulse this is normal albeit unpleasant treatment such as oxygen is not readily available and the guides and drivers have no medical expertise in ams aside from local remedies alcohol exacerbates the headaches caused by altitude sickness so if you are feeling bad or feeling fine in fact do not drink alcohol if you are feeling especially bad ask around if other travelers have acetazolamide brand name diamox be aware that this will make you need to pee constantly for hours but it will take away your headache serious side effects of acetazolmide are rare but if you take other medications please take care and ask a doctor before you go therefore the tour is not suitable for people who have flown straight in from santiago or a low altitude your body needs 3 days or more in san pedro atacama to be ready it is not a matter of age or fitness and chewing coca leaves will not prevent serious illness daytrips at altitude e.g to geysers del tatio and back are going to be less stressful on the body than the trip to uyuni which will be 3 full days constantly at well over 4000 meters you 're not climbing mount everest so altitude sickness wo n't be fatal but it 'll be a miserable 3 day experience if you are not at all acclimatized in more rare cases a progression of symptoms to persistent vomiting difficulty breathing at rest or a severe intractable headache that does not respond to simple pain relief paracetamol and ibuprofen indicates a serious medical emergency there is no cure except heading to lower ground if you can be prepared with the necessary medications eg acetazolamide if you have access to it and know how to use them consult with your physician before booking a trip especially if you have any heart or lung conditions the sun in san pedro can often emit dangerous levels of uv rays especially in summer using sunblock sunglasses a wide-brimmed hat and long sleeves is essential in winter the radiation levels are more tolerable and you can actually sunbathe in summer however do n't attempt it at all especially if your skin 's white the bare minimum upf for sunblock lotion is 45 60 and upwards being much better always remember to reapply it after an hour or so san pedro only has a posta a small medical facility with an er and some assorted paramedics there are several pharmacies in town if you become seriously ill or suffer a major lesion expect to be transferred to calama or even antofagasta at great expense while there are no major hazards in the area such as lethal diseases poisonous animals and so on take twice the care you normally would when hiking cycling and doing any other activity outdoors this applies even more to the geysers where burn-related injuries are n't that uncommon the place is virtually disconnected from the world so be extremely cautious when visiting despite rumors to the contrary exchange rates in town are decent but watch out for wild price swings in the currency of your interest-the money exchanges in town usually are lagging behind this info which can play in your favor or otherwise the dollar 's very appreciated and you can routinely get better rates there than in banks be mindful though that one-dollar and damaged bills wo n't be accepted the euro rates are terrible though while other currencies can be found somewhere in the middle again they only accept larger euro bills and only in mint condition there are several atms in town some of them in pharmacies a tip if an atm refuses to give you money it could be because its supply of a certain denomination is spent try another atm or the same atm with a different amount for instance if you wanted 35.000 pesos round it down to thirty-thousand or even twenty-thousand and withdraw money twice or a higher amount which actually makes more sense be aware that the atm money supply is limited on busy weekends it is not uncommon for all of the atms to be empty by sunday and they are not refilled until thursday it is advisable not to show up in san pedro without cash of some form you can go direct to uyuni from san pedro by jeep/ minibus transfer for 25,000 this can be arranged by a travel agent however you will also have to pay an extra park entrance fee of about 150 bolivianos 21 usd not all travel agents will tell you this when selling the ticket you will not have to pay this fee if you travel calama to uyuni you have to take attention booking with tour operators in chile since all the tours in salar de uyuni bolivia have to be guided by bolivian tour-guides a handful of agencies offer 3 days/2 nights tours to uyuni it does not really matter who you book with as they mostly join forces at least in low season and fill up their land cruisers with people from other agencies the going price starting at usd 140 march 2011 is some 40 higher here than in uyuni even though the itinerary is identical only reversed if you want to pay for the entire car yourself it is probably around 750 plus tip there is the advantage of there usually only being a few land cruisers at each site since you see things at different times of day to tours originating in uyuni where there can easily be a hundred tourists at each stop there 's also the possibility to return to san pedro a day later for a surcharge of usd 20 accommodations are quite basic with frequent lack of hot water and electricity meals are filling but hardly gourmet and vegetarians may find themselves a little lacking in protein bring plenty of snacks as supplies en route are extremely limited if your tour agency does not provide water ignore them when they tell you it is easy to buy on the journey in our experience it was not and you are better off bringing it all from san pedro at least 2l per person per day although at that altitude more would be good a sleeping bag and plenty of warm clothing are essentials it gets very cold at night the first night is spent at laguna colorada at 4370m so it is advisable to spend several nights in san pedro to acclimatise before taking the trip even then ams is a considerable risk-take the usual precautions and if you have any reason to be particularly worried about altitude consider taking the tour from bolivia instead where you will have far more opportunities to acclimatise to high altitude beforehand it is essential to get a written itinerary from the agency specifying all the sights in the order they are to be visited and also meals and accommodation whether shared or not some costs may not be included bolivian immigration entry fees for national parks and museums ask about these at the agency read travellor reviews of different agencies at the tourist information office estrella del sur has had a lot of good travellor feedback with excellent guides 140 usd march 2011 keep in mind that most guides/drivers do not speak english choose your tour company wisely also keep in mind that whether a tour is good or not often depends on the driver so even if one person had a good experience with a given company someone else may have a bad experience with a different driver from the same company if you know a specific driver from a specific company to ask for you may have luck or not as the trip lasts 3-4 days and a given driver might not be available to leave the dates that you want to go it may seem a bit like playing the lottery but in this case most people seem to win and enjoy their trips and bad drivers particularly drunks seem to be the exception rather than the rule all drivers for the trek to uyuni are required by law to be bolivian and most of them do not speak english very well you will need to tip your driver at the end usually around 20 per person this budget is for 6 people per 4x4 usually range rovers you can generally book the trip a day or two in advance although it may make sense to book farther in advance for busy seasons e.g holiday seasons be sure to check out the book of complaints in the tourist office on the plaza before handing over cash to a travel agent hitchhiking to argentina can take a while too as there is much less traffic it may help to start walking into the desert towards the airstrip see also section get in above
