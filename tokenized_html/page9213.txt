if all motion is relative how does light have a finite speed physics stack exchange by using our site you acknowledge that you have read and understand our cookie policy privacy policy and our terms of service i 've often heard that einstein shattered the notion of absolute motion i.e all things move relative to one another and that he established the speed of light as being absolute that sounds paradoxical to me i can not understand how the two concepts can be reconciled before going further i 'd like to say 1 over the years i 've seen many layman 's explanations on these topics including the nice youtube video by vsauce would headlights work at light speed i understand everything that 's said or at least i think i do just nothing i 've found seems to address this apparent contradiction 2 more recently i 've tried to find the answer on my own that includes searching the posts on this site some come close like this one but nothing i 've been able to find seems address specifically what i 'm asking back to the question relativity shows us that there is no universal frame of reference by which to judge motion so object a might be reckoned as moving at 10 m/s relative to object b or as stationary relative to object c. this is fine for me i can grasp that the universe has no intrinsic coordinate system that we only think that way on earth because we have the ground to move over then there 's the speed of light in a vacuum the speed of light is the ultimate speed limit it 's often said but if there is no universal frame of reference how can there be any such speed the very idea only make sense if there is a universal frame since i was very young it has always sounded to me like motion is only mostly relative that until you get close to the speed of light the effects of an absolute frame of reference are negligible perhaps that there is an actual fabric of space which everything moves relative to which is why there is something to expand between galaxies faster than light can propagate in the metric expansion of space growing up i always thought this would just start makes sense with time now i 'm up to a first year college level in physics i even know basic calculus yet i 'm still hopelessly confused edit thank you to whoever suggested this may be a duplicate of a href= https /physics.stackexchange.com/questions/114523/what-is-the-speed-of-light-relative-to what is the speed of light relative to it and others are very much related and at least partially answer my question unfortunately explaining that distances become shorter and time becomes slower as a way to stop you from exceeding the speed of light does not explain how that speed is not an absolute by my reckoning if all speed is relative then no matter how fast you go light should always race away from you at the same apparent speed i.e there should be no speed limit for there to be a speed which you can not exceed or you would catch up and make time irrelevant requires the very concept of some external speed by which light can travel and nothing else can reach thus my logical paradox continues unabated it sounds like your confusion is coming from taking paraphrasing such as everything is relative too literally furthermore this is n't really accurate so let me try presenting this a different way nature does n't care how we label points in space-time coordinates do not automatically have some real physical meaning let 's instead focus on what does n't depend on coordinate systems these are geometric facts or invariants for instance our space-time is 4 dimensional there are also things we can calculate like the invariant length of a path in space-time or angles between vectors it turns out our spacetime has a lorentzian signature roughly meaning that one of the dimensions acts differently than the others when calculating the geometric distance so there is not complete freedom to make everything relative some relations are a property of the geometry itself and are independent of coordinate systems i ca n't find the quote now but i remember seeing once a quote where einstein wished in reflection that instead of relativity it was the theory of invariants because those are what matter now it turns out that the lorentzian signature imposes a structure on spacetime in nice cartesian inertial coordinates with natural units the geometric length of a straight path between two points is d s 2 − d t 2 d x 2 d y 2 d z 2 ds^2 dt^2 dx^2 dy^2 dz^2 unlike space with a euclidean signature this separates pairs of points into three different groups 0 0 space like separated 0 0 time like separated 0 0 null separation or light like no matter what coordinate system you choose you can not change these they are not relative they are fixed by the geometry of spacetime this separation light cones if viewed as a comparison against a single reference point is the causal structure of space time it 's what allows us to talk about event a causing b causing c independently of a coordinate system now back to your original question let me note that speed itself is a coordinate system dependent concept if you had a bunch of identical rulers and clocks you could even make a giant grid of rulers and put clocks at every intersection to try to build up a physical version of a coordinate system with spatial differences being directly read off of rulers and time differences being read from clocks even in this idealized situation we can not yet measure the speed of light why because we still need to specify one more piece how remote clocks are synchronized it turns out the einstein convention is to synchronize them using the speed of light as a constant so in this sense it is a choice a choice of coordinate system there are many coordinate systems in which the speed of light is not constant or even depends on the direction so is that it it 's a definition that is not a very satisfying answer and not a complete one what makes relativity work is the amazing fact that this choice is even possible the modern statement of special relativity is usually something like the laws of physics have poincare symmetry lorentz symmetry translations rotations it is because of the symmetry of spacetime that we can make an infinite number of inertial coordinate systems that all agree on the speed of light it is the structure of spacetime its symmetry that makes special relativity einstein discovered this the other way around postulating that such a set of inertial frames were possible and derived lorentz transformations from them to deduce the symmetry of space-time so in conclusion if all motion is relative how does light have a finite speed not everything is relative in sr and speed being a coordinate system dependent quantity can have any value you want with appropriate choice of coordinate system if we design our coordinate system to describe space isotropically and homogenously and describe time uniformly to get our nice inertial reference frames the causal structure of spacetime requires the speed of light to be isotropic and finite and the same constant in all of the inertial coordinate systems first maxwell 's equations predict that the speed of light is absolute the whole motivation for the special theory of relativity is to reconcile this with the notion that all motion is relative in other words you 're worried about exactly the same thing that troubled einstein you just have n't understood how he solved it the key to your confusion is right here this isn t true in fact from the perspective of either one the other is moving away at a speed of about .88 c .88c of course you standing on the ground will claim that they are moving away from each other at 1.2 c 1.2c this is possible because observers in motion relative to each other will disagree about things like the distance between two events and the time between those events and therefore will disagree about the speeds at which things are moving away from each other special relativity tells you exactly how to calculate those disagreements by my reckoning if all speed is relative then no mater how fast you go light should always race away from you at the same apparent speed i.e there should be no speed limit if an invariant speed c c exists then if an entity has speed c c relative to an inertial reference frame irf the entity has speed c c relative to all irfs that 's what it means for there to be an invariant speed now if you think about that for a little bit it follows that an entity with speed less than or greater than c c in an irf can not have speed c c in any irf thus c c is a limiting speed in this sense entities either have speed c c in all irfs or an irf exists in which the entity has a speed that is arbitrarily close to c c for further reading i recommend this paper nothing but relativity in which it is shown that assuming only the principle of relativity the most general coordinate transformation involves an invariant speed we deduce the most general space-time transformation laws consistent with the principle of relativity thus our result contains the results of both galilean and einsteinian relativity the velocity addition law comes as a bi-product of this analysis we also argue why galilean and einsteinian versions are the only possible embodiments of the principle of relativity it is an experimental fact that light moves at the same speed in every reference frame no matter the underlying theory see the experiment of michelson and morley every kinematic and dynamical quantity depends on the reference frame except the speed of light which is the same for every observer besides the experimental result there is something deeper that comes from the principle of action at distance all the interactions present in the universe do not propagate instantaneously namely if something happens somewhere it takes a while for an observer located elsewhere to detect its consequences and this is true as a matter of fact for example if you take a small magnet generating a magnetic field and move it from its initial position it will take some time for an observer located far away to detect the change in the magnetic field generated this said as a consequence we must assume that there is somehow a velocity according to which the interactions propagate no matter what its nature is and also this velocity must be an upper limit for every other event in the universe otherwise such events will happen before they can actually propagate and this would obstruct the initial assumption that they must propagate first in order to be detected in other words if there is a speed of propagation for action at distance then this speed must be an upper limit also it must not depend on the reference frame either otherwise it would not be by definition the speed of propagation once you understand that such limit velocity must exist it is easy to introduce it into the equations you have to nothing but postulate that the same event propagates with that upper velocity limit in any reference frame namely you end up with c 2 t 2 − x 2 − y 2 − z 2 c 2 t ′ 2 − x ′ 2 − y ′ 2 − z ′ 2 c^2t^2-x^2-y^2-z^2=c^2t'^2-x'^2-y'^2-z'^2 where everything on the right hand side is primed except the upper velocity c c this is the starting point of the special theory of relativity that this velocity is accidentally the speed of light is proven experimentally a nice walkthrough is given by landau lifschitz in their textbooks on classical field theory nevertheless it could be interesting to have a look at the original paper by einstein as well although i find it ill-written by my reckoning if all speed is relative then no mater how fast you go light should always race away from you at the same apparent speed it does thats the clever bit no matter where you are or how fast you are going you will always get the same measurement of 3*10^8 meters per second for the speed of light in vacumn as every one else of course for this to be true then what you get when you measure a meter or a second must change as your velocity changes this is what they mean when they say 'time slows down as you get faster and it also explains why nothing that has mass can reach the speed of light mass means dimension which would have to become infinite for light to still be measured at c relative to the mass and that ca n't happen gennaro tedesco 's fantastic answer shows how the speed c c comes to mean the maximum speed that cause-effect links can propagate relative to any observer to to sum gennaro 's answer up to answer your title question the velocity concerned is the speed of cause-effect propagation relative to the observer 's rest frame it measures how long it takes to cause-effect to propagate between experimental kit at rest relative to the observer in his or her rest frame laboratory if you 're controlling apparatus at rest relative to you a distance d d away from you in your rest frame by remote control it will take time at least d c d/c for your control signal to reach the apparatus and this minimum delay per unit distance c − 1 c^ -1 is the same for all laboratories in inertial frames originally a comment but it 's getting a bit long so try the vsauce video again it does actually explain the matter try the bit from 3:00 to about 4:30 a few times and think hard one of the tricky parts about relativity is that you need to hold a lot of concepts in your head at once you really need to understand every part to get rid of the confusion there 's nothing really special about light it behaves the same way any other mass-less entity behaves and that includes the fact that any observer no matter his frame perceives the speed of light the speed of information to be the same it 's really a property of the space-time itself not something in the space-time you might want to ask why mass-less particles in particular behave this way in general but that 'd be a rather big new question to address your edit this is exactly the point about all the observers agreeing on one speed of light as far as the ship-based observer is concerned there actually is n't a finite maximum speed they can accelerate ever faster provided they have enough fuel and due to time-dilation which is not a simple trick it 's critical to understanding relativity they will be moving ever faster as far as they can tell from an observer on say earth they will be simply moving close to the speed of light but to themselves they can be going 1000c or whatever the language is a bit confusing especially when you only stay on the surface ideas like relative and absolute have a slightly different meaning than you might think in the relativity world we live in absolute is something all observers agree on relative is everything else so everyone can agree on one single speed of light from any point of view light always travels at the same speed however that 's pretty much the only thing they agree on hence the misleading quote everything is relative so why does that mean that we ca n't go around colonizing stars with a warp drive after all the observer on the ship can observe himself moving at 1000c ignoring the fuel costs and other complications so where 's the speed limit huh that 's the warp drive is n't it nope the problem is the trip back if you only care about colonizing and exploring the galaxy the only problem relativity brings is the cost of accelerating fast enough with respect to the source and target and slowing down again return trips are the tricky twin-paradox time-dilating kind but this also seems to be the way space-time works no matter what clever trick you use you ca n't really get around this if you used a traversable wormhole you 'd again be travelling at much higher speeds than c as far as you 're concerned but as soon as you got back to your point of origin you 'd find that the trip took a lot longer than you thought you never travelled faster than c with respect to your starting point this is a fundamental building block of the whole theory of relativity the way space-time works it 's hard to see how you could fix relativity while keeping the confirmed observations as the saying goes special relativity causality ftl pick any two also do n't forget that the c ~= 300 mm/s is just a matter of units it makes just as much sense to say that c 1 and derive all the other units from that in fact it 's rather practical for some applications i 'd like to add a little to greenbeans wonderful answer that not everything is relative he makes a few points at the end of his/her already long answer hurriedly not meant as a criticism it is a choice a choice of coordinate system there are many coordinate systems in which the speed of light is not constant or even depends on the direction so is that it it 's a definition that is not a very satisfying answer and not a complete one what makes relativity work is the amazing fact that this choice is even possible and further on if we design our coordinate system to describe space isotropically and homogenously and describe time uniformly we sometime forget in relativity and in differential geometry that there is still an objective reality in co-ordinates however bizarrely and human-centrically they may be defined and even though we think of them as human constructs at least in physics for co-ordinates to be useful there must be an objective physical procedure for finding the physical point in spacetime labelled by given co-ordinates let 's look at this objective nonrelative physics to use greenbeans words again the choice that makes an invariant c c possible and gives it physical meaning is the choice of affine co-ordinates roughly these are co-ordinates defined by the of rational multiples of displacements along linearly independent directions in space and time of uniform intervals marked out by unit measuring rods and clock ticks in each of the inertial frames physics enters our geometry insofar that we make the physical postulate that the euclidean geometrical notion of straightedge more generally geodesic segment and the idealized constructions defined by euclid 's postulates of marking out a rational number times a unit length along a straight line are a good mathematical model of what we do when we take a ruler and do the same this is an experimental objectively testable result likewise the time co-ordinate enters an analogous description by marking out rational multiples of unit ticks where the ticks are defined either by einstein 's procedures with light or one can use the definition in chapter 1 of 1 that uniform ticks are ones that the make the motion of a body uninfluenced by forces look uniform from an inertial frame there is another piece of objective nonrelative physics essential to the invariant speed concept and that is galileo 's principle the notion that an observer that there is no measurement that an observer in an inertial frame can do from within their own frame that can detect the observer 's motion relative to any other frame this is most poetically described in galileo 's own 1632 allegory of salviati 's ship within his famous dialogue concerning the two chief world systems the one that got him into heaps of trouble with pope urban ii when the latter having a bad hair day got a bit bolshie at the implied slight on papal infallibility once you accept galileo s relativity postulate as a piece of objective reproducible nonrelative physics this means that co-ordinate transformations between inertial frames must form a group there s a little bit more to this assertion as i show on my website 2 and also in a hopefully subject to review a forthcoming ejp article so a general transformation on co-ordinates x x is of the form x ↦ f t x x\mapsto f t x where the transformation t t belongs to a group and f f is the group s action on the co-ordinates then once you accept that affine geometry models real systems of surveying procedures and time measurement then the copernican notion that nature does n't care where we put our origin translates to f t x 1 y − f t x 2 y f t x 1 − f t x 2 f t x_1+y f t x_2+y =f t x_1 f t x_2 i.e the affine components of vectors linking two spacetime points with affine co-ordinate x 1 x_1 and x 2 x_2 are unaffected by an arbitrary shift y y of origin it then follows that the group action fulfils the equation h x y h x h y where h x d e f f t x − f t 0 h x+y h x +h y \text where h x \stackrel def f t x -f t,0 which is cauchy 's famous functional equation there is one and only one continuous solution to this equation and that is h x λ x h x \lambda\ x where λ \lambda is a matrix so if we make the further physical postulate that co-ordinate transformations are continuous then galileo s postulate copernican spatial homogeneity postualte continuity of transformation postulate co-ordinate transformations between inertial frames form a matrix group acting linearly on affine co-ordinates \text galileo 's postulate \text copernican spatial homogeneity postualte +\text continuity of transformation postulate \text co-ordinate transformations between inertial frames form a matrix group \\\text acting linearly on affine co-ordinates the physical postulate of continuous transformation encodes the everyday experimental result that as we ride on a bus we see trees and walkers in the street as we pass even though the bus is moving we do n't see their images shattered into disconnected chaotic sets another active user on this site benjamin crowell has a wonderful description about how affine geometry with metric structure leads to the lorentz transformation and the invariant speed concept in chapter 2 of his general relativity book 3 the following is my own take on it if we further postulate that there are collinear motions that are descibed by a matrix group parameterized by a real parameter such that group composition is a continuous function of this parameter then the only transformation group in keeping with this physical postulate as well as galileo 's copernicus 's and transformation continuity is of the form l exp η k η ∈ r \mathfrak l \exp \eta\ k |\ \eta\in\mathbb r so any co-ordinate transformation λ \lambda transforming the spacetime co-ordinates between inertial frames belongs to a group of 4 × 4 4\times4 matrices this form where k k is a constant matrix defining the direction of motion and η \eta is a generalized swiftness parameter called the rapitity just think of it as a speedometer reading transformed in a nonlinear way that we 'll discover below although this postulate sounds a bit technical here is the physical idea when we ride in a bus as we accelerate from the busstop to cruising speed and as we look out the window we see the motions of trees and walkers relative to us change continuously and not jerkily so now we need to find the matrix k k four more objective experimentally testable non relative pieces of physics now enter given the spatial isotropy postulate we can align our co-ordinate system so that the x x axis points along the direction relative motion we then use the orthogonal postulate together with isotropy to conclude that a co-ordinate transformation is unchanged if we rotate the co-ordinate system through any angle about the direction of motion we actually need the metric notion of orthogonal to define the rotation and we assume that the euclidean geometrical notion of rotation expressed by a rotation matrix conserving the euclidean inner product corresponds to the physical notion of rotation so if we rotate our co-ordinates about the x x -axis thus through angle ϕ \phi we transform our co-ordinates so that r x ϕ λ r x ϕ − 1 λ r_x \phi \lambda\ r_x \phi -1 \lambda and r x ϕ k r x ϕ − 1 k r_x \phi k\ r_x \phi -1 k thus k k must commute with r x ϕ r_x \phi and so the invariant subspaces of r x ϕ r_x \phi and k k must be the same the eigenvectors of r x ϕ r_x \phi are 0 0 1 ± i 0 \,0 \,1 \pm i together with any pair of linearly independent superpositions of ˆ t 1 0 0 0 \hat t 1 \,0 \,0 \,0 and ˆ x 0 1 0 0 \hat x 0 \,1 \,0 \,0 this assertion together with the understanding that k k must be real implies that the most general k k matrix must have the form k κ t t κ t x 0 0 κ x t κ x x 0 0 0 0 κ y y − κ y z 0 0 κ y z κ z z k=\left \begin array cccc \kappa_ t\ t \kappa_ t\ x 0 0\\\kappa_ x\ t \kappa_ x\ x 0 0\\0 0 \kappa_ y\ y -\kappa_ y\ z \\0 0 \kappa_ y\ z \kappa_ z\ z \end array \right here we assume our co-ordinates are column-vectors of the form t x y z t t x y z ^t now the movie reversal postulate shows that k k must become − k -k when we reverse the time co-ordinate thus k k anti -commutes with m d i a g − 1 1 1 1 m=\mathrm diag -1,1,1,1 imposing this anitcommutation we find k 0 κ t x 0 0 κ x t 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 k=\left \begin array cccc 0 \kappa_ t\ x 0 0\\\kappa_ x\ t 0 0 0\\0 0 0 0\\0 0 0 0\end array \right and only the x x and t t co-ordinates mix by the following 2 × 2 2\times 2 matrix λ η exp η ′ 0 κ t x κ x t 0 cosh √ ζ η √ ζ c sinh √ ζ η c √ ζ sinh √ ζ η cosh √ ζ η \lambda \eta \exp\left \eta^\prime\left \begin array cc 0 \kappa_ t\ x \\\kappa_ x\ t 0\end array \right \right \left \begin array cc \cosh\left \sqrt \zeta \eta \right \frac \sqrt \zeta c \sinh\left \sqrt \zeta \eta \right \\ \frac c \sqrt \zeta \sinh\left \sqrt \zeta \eta \right \cosh\left \sqrt \zeta \eta \right \\\end array \right where ζ ± 1 \zeta=\pm1 is the sign of κ t x κ x t \kappa_ t\ x \kappa_ x\ t and the constant with dimensions of velocity defined by κ t x ζ c 2 κ x t \begin equation \kappa_ t\ x \frac \zeta c^2 \kappa_ x\ t \end equation since we can absorb any real constant we like into the rapidity parameter and still get an additive rapidity parameter i.e λ η 1 λ η 2 λ η 1 η 2 \lambda \eta_1 \lambda \eta_2 \lambda \eta_1+\eta_2 we have replaced η κ x t c i \eta\ \kappa_ x\ t /c_i by η \eta in the above lastly we look at the signature ζ \zeta if ζ − 1 \zeta=-1 then the matrix above becomes the rotation matrix cos η − 1 c sin η c sin η cos η \left \begin array cc \cos\eta -\frac 1 c \sin\eta\\c \sin\eta \cos\eta \\\end array \right which means that for every vector between the spacetime co-ordinates of a cause and its effect we can find an inertial frame defined by η π \eta=\pi where this vector is reversed in direction this clearly violates the causality postulate so we conclude ζ 1 \zeta=+1 when ζ 1 \zeta=+1 the transformation is cosh η 1 c sinh η c sinh η cosh η \left \begin array cc \cosh\eta \frac 1 c \sinh\eta\\c \sinh\eta \cosh\eta \\\end array \right whose eigenvectors are t x ∝ 1 ± c t\ x \propto 1 \pm c this means that c c is invariant it is the same constant for all inertial observers furthermore with this choice we recover our intuitive notion of causality the everyday observation that causes come before effects but only if we further postulate that the invariant speed c c is the speed limit for the propagation of cause-effect as in my other answer causality is not the only physics that would be radically changed if ζ − 1 \zeta=-1 we know ζ 1 \zeta=+1 experimentally without even getting up from our seat other physics and relationships that would arise with ζ − 1 \zeta=-1 are explored by science fiction author greg egan in his trilogy orthogonal 4 a wonderful and correct summary of some of these weird changes in a non lorentzian universe are given as a primer for his trilogy on egan 's website 5 and include a variable lightspeed depending on wavelength thus a spectral spread of colors in the night sky the \it decrease of a body 's total energy as its speed increases and the \it emission of light by plants to allow them to gain energy by photosynthesis now if we set c → ∞ c\to\infty we recover galileo 's relativity and it is thus seen to be the unique relativity in keeping with our postulates that has absolute time i.e all inertial observers measure the same time interval between two events thus we see that special relativity is simply galileo 's relativity with the assumption of absolute time relaxed when we relax this assumption galileo s relativity foretells a whole family of relativites each parameterized by a different value of c c so in summary c c doesn t need to be thought of as a speed but rather simply a universal nonrelative constant that chooses which of galileo 's relativities is followed by our universe and it has the experimental meaning of the maximum speed of propagation of a cause-effect link as i describe in my other answer to arrive at this conclusion we have used the nonrelative objective experimentally reproducible physical postulates discussed in this answer it should be stated that the first person to think along the lines of a relativity not predicated on light was vladimir ignatowski in 1910 6 other references describing and building on his approach are given in the bibliography of my paper 2 of which a preprint can be seen on my website 1 charles misner kip thorne john wheeler gravitation the famous big black book quite a tough project to read but ultimately very clear and a definitely worthwhile acquisition for anyone interested in either special or general relativity a hardcover version is also essential get it second hand 202 for a paperback is outrageous as this beast is so large its own weight utterly destroys even the best quality paperback bindings after a few months of fireside reading you could also wait for a kindle edition or as i did buy a paperback and have it scanned 2 rod vance of galileo groups and what 's so special about the speed of light under review by the european journal of physics 3 benjamin crowell general relativity see chapter 2 for an excellent discussion of how the form of the lorentz transformation follows

relevant sections of his gr text clearer he also has a fun read 3c benjamin crowell relativity for poets wherein he gives a great presentation of the underlying ideas philosophies and history of

english translation some general remarks on the relativity principle is here although there are several excellent answers perhaps my answer will remove your confusion in your statement if all motion is relative finite speed you need to pay special attention to the words motion and speed motion is just a space displacement how fast it is accomplished is irrelevant speed is a rate of change of space displacement per unit of time they are different entities an example might make it clearer there are two ships in the sea one is going east at 100 mph and the other is going west at 100mph they are parallel to each other and about 100 ft apart a fish swims between them at a speed of 200 mph the question now is what is the speed of the fish the answer obviously is 200 mph what is the relative motion of the ships they are moving away from each other the ships motion has nothing to do with the fish 's speed this speed is determined by the characteristics of the fish and the sea water likewise the speed of light electromagnetic waves depends on the characteristics of light and the propagation medium assuming a homogenous universe the speed of light would have a constant value throughout the universe independent of any observer if all motion is relative how does light have a finite speed because of the wave nature of matter check out the the other meaning of special relativity by robert close when you and your rods and clocks are all made out of waves you calibrate your rods and clocks using the motion of waves then use them to measure the motion of waves it does n't matter how fast those waves move this inherent tautology means you always measure the speed of light to be the same see http //arxiv.org/abs/0705.4507 where magueijo and moffat talk about it following ellis let us first consider c as the speed of the photon can c vary could such a variation be measured as correctly pointed out by ellis within the current protocol for measuring time and space the answer is no the unit of time is defined by an oscillating system or the frequency of an atomic transition and the unit of space is defined in terms of the distance travelled by light in the unit of time we therefore have a situation akin to saying that the speed of light is one light-year per year i.e its constancy has become a tautology or a definition i 've often heard that einstein shattered the notion of absolute motion i.e all things move relative to one another and that he established the speed of light as being absolute that sounds paradoxical to me i can not understand how the two concepts can be reconciled it 's a myth popularized by people who 've never actually read what einstein said and who appeal to his authority whilst flatly contradicting what he said see this the speed of light varies in the room you 're in if it did n't your pencil would n't fall down also see this baez article back to the question relativity shows us that there is no universal frame of reference by which to judge motion that 's another myth i 'm afraid check out the cmb rest frame our local group of galaxies is moving at circa 627 km/s relative to the reference frame of the cmb then there 's the speed of light in a vacuum the speed of light is the ultimate speed limit it 's often said but if there is no universal frame of reference how can there be any such speed the very idea only make sense if there is a universal frame see above the cmb rest frame is the reference frame of the universe all these spacetime bending consequences used to explain why nothing can move past this speed only seems to enshrine the concept that there is some ultimate speed standard check out pair production and the wave nature of matter nothing can move faster than the speed of waves because they 're made of waves perhaps that there is an actual fabric of space which everything moves relative to which is why there is something to expand between galaxies faster than light can propagate in the metric expansion of space growing up i always thought this would just start makes sense with time now i 'm up to a first year college level in physics i even know basic calculus yet i 'm still hopelessly confused read what einstein said and you wo n't be he thought of space as a something rather than a nothing see his 1920 leyden address and read this by nobel laureate robert b laughlin it is ironic that einstein 's most creative work the general theory of relativity should boil down to conceptualizing space as a medium when his original premise in special relativity was that no such medium existed for starters special relativity only seems bizarre to someone who does not see it at work in its entirety if its entirety is being seen it becomes nothing but a simple single image from that simple single image one can in mere minutes derive the entire collection of special relativity equations to learn of special relativity by one 's self you simply need to analyze motion by one 's self and do so by starting from scratch imagine the existence of an absolute 4 dimensional environment that has 3 dimensions of space and 1 dimension of time let 's call it space-time now imagine that all objects that are located within this 4d environment are constantly on the move and that they are all moving with the same magnitude of motion if this motion was in the direction of moving across space only this ongoing motion would be measured by others as being the speed of light thus overall what we have is absolute motion that is constantly ongoing within an absolute 4d environment if a bird changes its direction of spatial travel the bird rotates in space if any object within 4d space-time changes its direction of travel it too will rotate now if you proceed to analyze the outcome that is produced via this combination of absolutes and rotation you end up with special relativity and you also quickly derive all of the mathematical equations by starting with the absolutes which lead you to special relativity one in turn sees the absolute foundation of which special relativity resides within once this is achieved it becomes child 's play to understand why all observers measure the speed of light as being 300,000 km/s however if these absolutes are left out of the picture then ones understanding of special relativity becomes less than absolute thus the speed of light in turn has no absolute reference 2019 stack exchange inc
