less than or equal to 1.4 a process for their preparation and fertil applicable methods of polyisobutenamines as fuel additives from polyisobuteneamines refers to oligomeric compounds of the general formula r a -x wherein r a is a polyisobutenyl radical having a number average molecular weight m n in the range of 500 is to 1500 and x is a polar organic radical having one or more amino groups polyisobuteneamines have paramount importance as fuel additives for gasoline and diesel engines in particular for keeping valves and carburetor or injection systems as well as lubricant additives see also m. ross beck in catalysts surfactants oil additives ed j. falbe u. hasserodt s 223 g. thieme verlag stuttgart 1978 the preparation of polyisobutene amines is generally carried out by functionalization of reactive polyisobutenes ie polyisobutenes having a terminal reactive functionality olefinic end groups are suitable for functionalization in special dimensions polyisobutenes are therefore with a high content of olefinic nic unsaturated end groups for the preparation of polyisobutenamines advantageous see formulas a and b a b the prior art teaches the preparation of olefin polyisobutenes by cationic polymerization of isobutene or isobutene-containing hydrocarbon streams in the presence of boron trifluoride complex catalysts see for example de-a 27 02 604 ep-a 145 235 ep -a 481 297 ep 671 419 ep-a 628 575 ep-a 807641 and wo 99/31151 the polyisobutenes obtained have a high content of olefinically unsaturated terminal groups in particular end groups of the general formula a however the polyisobuteneamines prepared by functionalization of the abovementioned polyisobutenes have an unsatisfactory viscosity behavior in particular at low temperatures and can therefore be undesirable side effects in engines such as the valve insert so-called lead this deficiency is remedied usually by the addition of large amounts of so-called carrier oils that are not own or have only insufficient detergency and only the viscosity characteristics of the conventional polyisobuteneamines improve the proportion of carrier oil exceeds the additive fuels in general the proportion of polyisobuteneamine significantly although one can improve through the use of shorter polyisobutenes the viscosity behavior at the same time however the detergency considerably lowers the present invention is based on the object to provide polyisobutenamines which have a high detergent effect and an improved viscosity behavior simultaneously the polyisobuteneamines to a significantly reduced amount of additional excipients in particular carrier oils make do without affecting the properties of the additive compositions negative investigations have shown that the unfavorable viscosity behavior of conventional polyisobuteneamines is due to a comparatively high proportion of products whose polyisobutenyl exceed a molecular weight of 1500 daltons in other words the relatively high molecular non-uniformity of the polyisobutenes previously available by a polydispersity m w m n ratio of gewichtsmitt- sized molecular weight m w to the number average molecular weight m n is charakterist requires a comparatively high proportion of undesirable polyisobuteneamines tenresten with long chain polyisobutylene although known from the cited prior art provide polyisobutenes having a high proportion of reactive end groups however the products obtained have comparatively high proportions of high molecular weight products on the molecular weight distribution of such polyisobutenes is therefore characterized by the polydispersity m w m n above 1.6 polyisobutene derivatives having a narrow molecular weight distribution of the polyisobutene groups may living by

accordance with the initiator system with the isobutene or the isobutene-containing feedstock in the inert organic solvent at the desired reaction temperature here you can do this is to initially

presently described batch operation the procedure will typically so that one first compound iii and optionally the compound iv and then adding the lewis acid the timing of the addition of initiator is considered to be the time at which the two components of the initiator system are present in the reaction vessel for example one can proceed so that firstly the solvent then the compound iii and optionally the donor iv and then introducing a portion or the total amount of isobutene or of the isobutene-containing feedstock the polymerization is initiated by adding the lewis acid and thereafter optionally supplying any residual amounts of isobutene or isobutene feedstock polymerization however it is also possible first to the solvent then submit the lewis acid and part or the total amount of isobutene or of the isobutene-containing starting material and then the polymerization by adding the compound iii and if necessary to start the compound iv but performs this procedure to a slightly broader molecular weight distribution in addition to the herein described batchwise procedure can shape the polymerization as a continuous process in this case that is the monomers to be polymerized

of the initiator system via multi-fluid nozzles can be done in order to achieve good mixing of the components the heat of reaction in the batchwise as well as in the continuous reaction is carried out in a customary manner for example by internally installed heat exchanger through external heat exchangers and or by wall cooling and or taking advantage of evaporative cooling here in particular the use of ethene and or mixtures of ethylene with other hydrocarbons and or halogenated hydrocarbons has been proven as a solvent since ethylene is not only inexpensive but also has a boiling point in the desired polymerisationstempera- turbereich suitable reaction vessels for carrying out the method according to the invention are in principle all reactors as they are usually used in a cationic

measures can be transferred to the novel process in an analogous manner 25 preferably the means used for the deactivation or its mixture with an inert solvent is cooled prior to deactivation at

that of the by hydroformylation and subsequent reductive amination with ammonia according to example 1 ep-a 244 616 was obtained for determining the valve plugging according to cec f-16-t96 three additized fuels were prepared as described above where here was the concentrations of polyisobuteneamine 1 g per kilogram of base fuel this additized fuels were treated with a reference carrier oil of poly-1-butene oxide kerocom®3364 basf aktiengesellschaft in concentration steps of 0.03 g per kg additized fuel so that fuels with a carrier oil concentrations of 0.03 g kg to 0 15 g kg was obtained the addition of carrier oil thereby reduces with increasing concentration the viscosity of the additive-containing fuel and hence also the tendency to sticking of the valves was then determined by cec-f-lb-t96 method at 5 ° c which concentration is required to transfer oil to reliably prevent a sticking of the valves under the experimental conditions in table 1 the concentrations are given to carrier oil in which the test successfully that is without a valve plug composed and concentration at which an undesired sticking of the valves was observed therefore are beneficial in this test polyisobuteneamines pass the test with the smallest possible addition of carrier oil as this indicates a particularly favorable viscosity behavior by comparing the amount together in table 1 summarized data show that polyisobuteneamines the invention are distinguished by good to very good valve purification at significantly superior viscosity properties table 1 2 m w weight average
