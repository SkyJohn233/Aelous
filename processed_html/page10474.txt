CHICKEN MACARONI SOUP 2 cups deboned... - Mama ' s Guide Recipes | Facebook CHICKEN MACARONI SOUP  2 cups deboned chicken leftovers   1/2 cup red and green pimientos  1/2 cup celery  1 cup cabbage  1/2 cup carrots  3 tablespoons cooking oil  1/4 cup minced garlic   1/2 cup chopped onions   8 cups chicken stock  1 cup uncooked macaroni pasta  1/4 cup Parmesan cheese   1 cup fresh milk  salt and pepper to taste  Mama ' s Guide Instructions:  1 Flake or cube chicken leftovers. Dice peppers and celery. Cut cabbage into shreds and carrots into ribbon like strips. Set aside.   2 Heat oil in a medium pot, and sauté garlic and onions. Add the cubed chicken and stir. Pour in chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add the pasta and stir so macaronis don’t stick together. Allow to boil for about 5 minutes more or until pasta is half-cooked. Add carrots, cabbage, celery, and pimientos, in that order. When pasta is al dente (firm to the bite), throw in Parmesan cheese and milk. Season with salt and pepper.   3 Transfer to a soup bowl and serve with croutons or crackers. Serve hot. Mix well. Season with salt and pepper, if desired.  Macaroni-cooking tip: The macaroni will continue cooking in the soup even after the heat has been turned off. If left sitting in stock, pasta continues to absorb the liquid as it cools. When this happens, simply add stock again when reheating. Be sure to bring additional liquid to a boil first before throwing in pasta and vegetables, to avoid soggy macaroni.
