sita kugel desmoulin lei wang and larry h. matherly additional article information the proton-coupled folate transporter pcft is a proton-folate symporter with an acidic ph optimum by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction pcft was expressed in the majority of 53 human tumor cell lines with the highest levels in caco-2 colorectal adenocarcinoma skov3 ovarian and hepg2 hepatoma cells a novel 6-substituted pyrrolo 2,3- d pyrimidine thienoyl antifolate compound 1 was used to establish whether pcft can deliver cytotoxic drug under ph conditions that mimic the tumor microenvironment both 1 and pemetrexed pmx inhibited proliferation of r1-11-pcft4 hela cells engineered to express pcft without the reduced folate carrier rfc and of hepg2 cells expressing both pcft and rfc unlike pmx 1 did not inhibit proliferation of r1-11-rfc6 hela cells which express rfc without pcft treatment of r1-11-pcft4 cells at ph 6.8 with 1 or pmx inhibited colony formation with dose and time dependence transport of 3 h compound 1 into r1-11-pcft4 and hepg2 cells was optimal at ph 5.5 but appreciable at ph 6.8 at ph 6.8 3 h compound 1 was metabolized to 3 h-labeled polyglutamates glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase garftase in r1-11-pcft4 cells was inhibited by 1 at ph 6.8 as measured by an in situ garftase assay and was accompanied by substantially reduced atp levels compound 1 caused s-phase accumulation and a modest level of apoptosis an in vivo efficacy trial with severe combined immunodeficient mice implanted with subcutaneous hepg2 tumors showed that compound 1 was active our findings suggest exciting new therapeutic possibilities to selectively deliver novel antifolate drugs via transport by pcft over rfc by exploiting the acidic tumor microenvironment antifolates are some of the most versatile and best understood cancer chemotherapy drugs these agents notably aminopterin revolutionized the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia by inducing complete remissions in children with leukemia farber and diamond 1948 aminopterin and methotrexate mtx were recognized to disrupt folate metabolism by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase monahan and allegra 2006 subsequent generations of antifolates primarily targeted other key folate-dependent enzymes including thymidylate synthase pemetrexed pmx and x003b2 -glycinamide ribonucleotide gar formyltransferase garftase lometrexol for all these agents cellular uptake and metabolism to polyglutamates are critical to drug activity mendelsohn et al. 1999 monahan and allegra 2006 chattopadhyay et al. 2007 the anionic nature of antifolates precludes their diffusion across biological membranes three genetically distinct and functionally diverse transport systems have evolved to facilitate their uptake into mammalian cells 1 the reduced folate carrier rfc slc19a1 a member of the major facilitator superfamily of solute carriers is an anionic antiporter and the major transport system for reduced folates in mammalian cells and tissues at physiologic ph matherly et al. 2007 rfc is ubiquitously expressed in normal and malignant tissues 2 folate receptors frs x003b1 and x003b2 are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane proteins that transport folates by receptor-mediated endocytosis fr x003b1 is expressed in epithelial cells of the kidney choroid plexus retina uterus and placenta malignant tissues also express fr x003b1 including adenocarcinomas of the cervix uterus and ovary elnakat and ratnam 2004 3 the proton-coupled folate transporter pcft slc46a1 is a proton-folate symporter that functions optimally at acidic ph by coupling the downhill flow of protons to the uphill flow of folates into cells qiu et al. 2006 nakai et al. 2007 zhao and goldman 2007 pcft is expressed in normal mouse and human tissues high pcft levels are present at the apical brush-border membrane along the proximal jejunum and duodenum and in kidney liver placenta and choroid plexus whereas much lower levels were detected in other tissues qiu et al. 2007 zhao et al. 2009 kugel desmoulin et al. 2010a although a low ph transport activity was described in human tumor cell lines of assorted origins zhao et al. 2004 presumably as a result of pcft tumor expression of pcft has not been systematically studied there is now ample precedent for using fr x003b1 to selectively target tumors with cytotoxic agents for therapeutic benefit gibbs et al. 2005 hilgenbrink and low 2005 salazar and ratnam 2007 deng et al. 2008 2009 wang et al. 2010 pcft transport function may be enhanced in many solid tumors by the acidic ph of the tumor microenvironment which has been reported to reach as low as ph 6.2 to 6.8 wike-hooley et al. 1984 helmlinger et al. 1997 raghunand et al. 1999 intracellular ph is normally alkaline which creates a substantial transmembrane ph gradient directed intra cellularly fais et al. 2007 clearly harnessing this proton-motive gradient to transport cytotoxic antifolates into tumor cells by pcft offers a uniquely attractive mechanism of therapeutic targeting solid tumors for tumor targeting of cytotoxic drugs via fr or pcft ideally therapeutic agents have been developed that are specifically transported by frs and/or pcft and not by rfc gibbs et al. 2005 hilgenbrink and low 2005 salazar and ratnam 2007 deng et al. 2008 2009 kugel desmoulin et al. 2010b wang et al. 2010 this strategy is necessary because antifolate membrane transport by rfc precludes tumor selectivity in that rfc is expressed in both normal and tumor cells and rfc transport is optimal at neutral ph characterizing most normal tissues zhao and goldman 2003 matherly et al. 2007 indeed a major obstacle in implementing this approach has been a lack of fr- or pcft-selective antifolates because all of the clinically useful antifolates with significant fr- and pcft substrate activity e.g. mtx and pmx are also transported by rfc matherly et al. 2007 we recently described a novel 2-amino-4-oxo-6-substituted pyrrolo 2,3- d pyrimidine antifolate with a thienoyl-for-benzoyl replacement and a bridge length of four carbons compound 1 fig 1 wang et al. 2010 cellular uptake of compound 1 by fr x003b1 was substantial in the absence of its membrane transport by rfc resulting in potent antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo because of inhibition of garftase in de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis although transport of compound 1 by pcft was also inferred neither this nor the capacity of pcft to deliver a cytotoxic dose of compound 1 under conditions relevant to the solid tumor microenvironment was directly tested this report describes such experiments with compound 1 to establish the feasibility of selectively targeting chemotherapy to human solid tumors based upon drug membrane transport by pcft experiments are also described documenting the pcft transport and polyglutamylation characteristics of compound 1 which account for its potent inhibition of garftase leading to tumor cell death in vitro and in vivo 3 x02032 ,5 x02032 ,7- 3 h mtx 20 ci/mmol 3 h pmx 2.5 ci/mmol and custom-radiolabeled 3 h compound 1 1.3 ci/mmol were

health dct/dtp animal production program frederick md for the efficacy study mice were 8 weeks old on day 0 tumor implant with an average body weight of 17.6 g. mice were provided food and water ad libitum study mice were maintained on either a folate-deficient diet harlan-teklad madison wi or a folate-replete diet autoclavable mouse breeder diet starting 16 days before subcutaneous tumor implant to ensure serum folate levels would approximate those of humans folate serum levels were determined before tumor implantation and after the study with a lactobacillus casei bioassay varela-moreiras and selhub 1992 the animals were pooled and implanted bilaterally subcutaneously with 30- to 60-mg tumor fragments by a 12-gauge trocar and again pooled before unselective distribution to the various treatment and control groups chemotherapy was begun 4 days after tumor implantation when the number of cells was relatively small 10 7 x02013 10 8 cells before the established limit of palpation tumors were measured with a caliper two or three times weekly mice were sacrificed when the cumulative tumor burden reached 1500 mg. tumor weights were estimated from two dimensional measurements i.e. tumor mass in milligrams ab 2 /2 where a and b are the tumor length and width in millimeters respectively for calculation of end points both tumors on each mouse were added together and the total mass per mouse was used the following quantitative end points were used to assess antitumor activities 1 t c and t x02212 c tumor growth delay where t is the median time in days required for the treatment group tumors to reach a predetermined size e.g. 500 mg and c is the median time in days for the control group tumors to reach the same size tumor-free survivors are excluded from these calculations and 2 calculation of tumor cell kill log10 cell kill total gross t x02212 c 3.32 t d where t x02212 c is the tumor growth delay as described above and t d is the tumor volume

model these methods are essentially identical to those described previously wang et al. 2010 on the basis of a report of a low ph transport activity in solid tumor cell lines zhao et al. 2004 presumably reflecting pcft we turned our attention to establishing an expression profile for hpcft compared with hrfc and frs in a number of cell lines derived from human solid tumors and leukemias transcript levels for hpcft hrfc and frs x003b1 and x003b2 were measured by real-time rt-pcr and normalized to gapdh our results showed significant levels of hpcft transcripts in the majority of human solid tumor cell lines of different origins e.g. breast prostate ovarian etc fig 2 a and uniformly low hpcft transcript levels in human leukemias including both all and acute myeloid leukemia supplemental fig 1s c hpcft levels were highest in caco-2 colorectal adenocarcinoma skov3 ovarian carcinoma hepg2 hepatoma and h69 small cell lung cancer cells with appreciable hpcft levels in numerous other tumor sublines hrfc transcripts were detected in all solid tumor and leukemia cell lines with the exception of mda-mb-231 breast cancer cells fig 2 b and supplemental fig 1s d high levels of fr x003b1 were detected in a small subset of ovarian cervical and breast cancer cell lines and low but detectable fr x003b1 levels were measured in all mostly t-cell sublines supplemental fig 1s a and b fr x003b2 transcripts were consistently low to undetectable in both solid tumors and leukemias with the highest levels restricted to a small number of acute myeloid leukemia and t-cell all sublines not shown our previous studies wang et al. 2010 established that the novel pyrrolo 2,3- d pyrimidine thienoyl antifolate compound 1 fig 1 was a potent nanomolar inhibitor of proliferation of a chinese hamster ovary cho subline engineered to express hpcft in the absence of other folate transporters rfc and frs and of 3 h mtx transport by hpcft suggesting competitive binding to the carrier and transport by this mechanism conversely the data strongly suggested that compound 1 was not transported by hrfc in a cho subline similarly engineered to exclusively express hrfc to begin to establish the therapeutic potential of hpcft as a selective approach for chemotherapy drug delivery to human solid tumors we used isogenic hela sublines derived by stable transfections of hrfc- and hpcft-null r1-11 hela cells designated r1-11-pcft4 express physiologic levels of hpcft in the absence of hrfc as measured by real-time rt-pcr and r1-11-rfc6 engineered to express hrfc without hpcft zhao et al. 2008 fig 3 a low levels of fr x003b1 were detected in all the r1-11 sublines as a tumor prototype we used hepg2 cells established from our tumor cell line screen to express significant levels of hpcft and hrfc fig 2 without fr x003b1 expression levels for hpcft and hrfc in hepg2 cells are compared with those for the r1-11 sublines in fig 3 a we measured inhibition of cell proliferation by compound 1 and results were compared with those for pmx pmx inhibited cell growth in both the r1-11-pcft4 and r1-11-rfc6 lines with ic 50 values mean x000b1 s.e.m of 59.3 x000b1 7.37 and 81.7 x000b1 5.49 nm respectively fig 3 b demonstrating its lack of specificity for hpcft over hrfc despite its high pcft substrate activity zhao et al. 2008 kugel desmoulin et al. 2010b conversely compound 1 inhibited cell growth in r1-11-pcft4 cells ic 50 99.2 x000b1 20.2 nm but not r1-11-rfc6 fig 3 c indicating selective hpcft transport in hepg2 cells both pmx ic 50 40.63 x000b1 4.52 nm and compound 1 ic 50 227.50 x000b1 8.98 nm were growth inhibitory the decreased sensitivity to compound 1 for hepg2 cells compared with r1-11-pcft4 cells probably reflects the presence of hrfc in hepg2 cells although not active for transport with compound 1 hrfc still transports folates and elevates intracellular folate pools resulting in decreased cytotoxic drug effects on this basis proliferation assays were extended to include colony-forming assays in which r1-11-pcft4 cells were exposed to a range of concentrations 1 x02013 10 x003bc m of compound 1 fig 3 d or pmx e for 16 24 or 48 h. drug exposures were performed at ph 6.8 after which drugs were removed and colonies allowed to outgrow for 12 days as an inhibitor of colony formation pmx and compound 1 showed both concentration and time dependence although this effect was more pronounced for compound 1 and pmx was more active at 16 h for the lower drug concentrations despite the latter activity the maximum extent of inhibition after 48 h at 10 x003bc m drug was greater for compound 1 95 than for pmx 87 collectively these results demonstrate that compound 1 like pmx is cytotoxic toward cells that express hpcft and under acidic conditions ph 6.8 achievable in solid tumors unlike pmx compound 1 is selectively active toward cells expressing hpcft and is inactive toward cells expressing exclusively hrfc to directly measure hpcft membrane transport of the cytotoxic antifolates into hela r1-11-pcft4 and hepg2 cells we used radiolabeled compound 1 and pmx for r1-11-pcft4 cells uptake of 3 h compound 1 0.25 x003bc m was time- and ph-dependent with maximum drug accumulation at ph 5.5 fig 4 a x02013 c uptake in r1-11-pcft4 cells exceeded that of its hpcft-null isogenic counterpart r1-11-mock transfectant unequivocally establishing transport of compound 1 by hpcft the modest time-dependent uptake in the hpcft-null r1-11-mock transfected subline was particularly obvious at 30 min and probably reflects the presence of low levels of fr in these cells fig 3 a we compared the uptake of 3 h pmx with that of 3 h compound 1 in hepg2 cells fig 4 d and e for compound 1 ph-dependent uptake in hepg2 cells showed a profile despite the x0223c 2-fold increased net uptake similar to that of r1-11-pcft4 hela cells net uptake of 3 h pmx exceeded that of 3 h compound 1 in hepg2 cells by x0223c 50 to 100 and showed a greater uptake fraction at neutral ph most likely due to the presence of hrfc in hepg2 cells fig 3 a we measured transport kinetics over 2 min for 3 h compound 1 and 3 h pmx in r1-11-pcft4 cells using a range of drug concentrations at ph 5.5 and 6.8 table 1 the data show nearly identical k t values for compound 1 and pmx at ph 5.5 and only modest within x0223c 40 differences in v max increases in both k t increased x0223c 300- to 400-fold respectively compared with values at ph 5.5 and v max values x0223c 70 increased were measured at ph 6.8 v max k t ratios for compound 1 and pmx were similar within x0223c 2-fold at both ph 5.5 and ph 6.8 these results establish that for both r1-11-pcft4 and hepg2 cells compound 1 is an excellent substrate for hpcft essentially equivalent to pmx polyglutamylation of classic antifolates is a critical factor in drug activity because these conjugated drug forms are retained within cells and they typically inhibit folate-dependent enzyme targets to a greater extent than their nonpolyglutamyl forms goldman and matherly 1985 shane 1989 to assess the extent of this metabolism for compound 1 in r1-11-pcft4 and hepg2 cells cells were treated with 1 x003bc m 3 h compound 1 for 16 h at ph 6.8 in the presence of adenosine 60 x003bc m for hepg2 cells parallel incubations were performed with 3 h pmx in presence of thymidine 10 x003bc m and adenosine 3 h-labeled metabolites were extracted and analyzed by reversed-phase hplc fig 5 shows an hplc chromatograph for compound 1 in hepg2 cells additional results for r1-11-pcft4 and hepg2 cells are included in the supplemental fig 2s a and b up to five polyglutamyl metabolites of 3 h compound 1 and 3 h pmx pg 2 x02013 6 were resolved by hplc the identities of the peaks were confirmed by comparing elution times with those for mtx polyglutamyl standards and by treatment with chicken pancreas conjugase which reverted the majority of the polyglutamyl metabolites to the parental drug supplemental fig 2s c the distributions of the individual compound 1 and pmx drug forms in r1-11-pcft4 and hepg2 cells are summarized in table 2 although there were differences in the relative amounts of total intracellular compound 1 between the r1-11-pcft4 and hepg2 sublines as expected from the transport results in fig 4 in both cases compound 1 was predominantly polyglutamylated 64 and 84 of the total intracellular drug respectively for hepg2 cells the increased accumulation of 3 h compound 1 over that of r1-11-pcft4 cells was reflected in the polyglutamate levels analogous results were obtained with 3 h pmx in hepg2 cells although the net extent of drug uptake and metabolism of 3 h pmx was elevated over that of 3 h compound 1 collectively these results establish that like pmx compound 1 is an excellent substrate for polyglutamylation under conditions ph 6.8 that favor its membrane transport by hpcft we previously reported that the principal intracellular target of compound 1 in hpcft-expressing cho cells is garftase wang et al. 2010 the first folate-dependent enzyme in de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis to confirm this result in r1-11-pcft4 hela cells under acidic conditions ph 6.8 that favor pcft transport we used an in situ metabolic assay that quantifies incorporation of 14 c glycine into 14 c formyl gar as a measure of garftase inhibition results were compared with those of pmx an established garftase inhibitor along with its documented effects on thymidylate synthase chattopadhyay et al. 2007 and 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase racanelli et al. 2009 fig 6 ic 50 values for garftase inhibition in r1-11-pcft4 cells by compound 1 and pmx were 43.6 and 69.7 nm respectively although the ic 50 for garftase inhibition by compound 1 closely approximated the ic 50 for growth inhibition of r1-11-pcft4 cells fig 3 c garftase inhibition by pmx was incomplete up to 5 x003bc m. analogous results were described for pmx with hpcft-expressing cho cells r2/hpcft4 kugel desmoulin et al. 2010b and with ccrf-cem cells by racanelli et al 2009 to confirm that potent inhibition of garftase in r1-11-pcft4 cells by compound 1 also results in decreased atp pools we measured intracellular atp levels in cells treated with 10 x003bc m compound 1 for 16 24 and 48 h under acidic conditions ph 6.8 analogous to those used for our clonogenicity studies fig 3 d compound 1 caused a time-dependent decrease in cellular atp levels such that treatment for 48 h led to an 88 decrease in atp pools fig 7 a these results demonstrate that hpcft-delivery of compound 1 is an efficient mode of drug uptake that effects a potent inhibition of garftase and atp depletion in r1-11-pcft4 cells to determine the impact of garftase inhibition and atp depletion on cell-cycle progression we treated r1-11-pcft4 cells with compound 1 10 x003bc m for 48 h at ph 6.8 along with a vehicle control cells were fixed stained with pi and analyzed for cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry treatment with 10 x003bc m compound 1 caused an accumulation of cells in s phase such that 38.9 of cells were in s phase compared with 16.8 of the control fig 7 b supplemental fig 3s when a range of concentrations 0.5 1 5 and 10 x003bc m of compound 1 were tested for their abilities to induce s-phase accumulation we found that maximal arrest was achieved at 1 x003bc m. because treatment with compound 1 10 x003bc m 48 h at ph 6.8 causes loss of clonogenicity in r1-11-pcft4 cells fig 3 d and a modest increase in the sub-g 1 fraction fig 7 b we were interested in measuring apoptosis under these same conditions using annexin v/pi staining results were compared with those for r1-11-pcft4 cells treated with etoposide 5 x003bc m and with a no-drug control whereas etoposide strongly induced apoptosis 12.2 early apoptotic and 22.3 late apoptotic/necrotic compared with the negative controls 2.9 and 10.3 respectively compound 1 was less apoptotic 8.4 and 15.7 respectively fig 7 c these results are consistent with previous reports that garftase inhibitors are distinctly cytotoxic yet modestly apoptotic smith et al. 1993 deng et al. 2008 as proof of concept that in vivo antitumor efficacy can result from tumor targeting of compound 1 via its transport by hpcft an in vivo efficacy trial was performed with 8-week-old female icr scid mice implanted with subcutaneous hepg2 tumors that express hpcft and hrfc but not fr x003b1 fig 3 a mice were maintained ad libitum on folate-deficient or standard folate-replete diets serum folate concentrations were measured in mice after 14 days on the folate-deficient diet by an l. casei bioassay the value was 90.2 nm median range 79.2 x02013 120.7 nm n 3 this value slightly exceeds serum folate levels 31 and 35 nm respectively reported previously in humans ganji and kafai 2009 with the standard diet by comparison serum folate was 715.2 nm median range 652.8 x02013 742.8 nm n 3 for the trial control and drug treatment groups were nonselectively randomized five mice per group compound 1 was administered intravenously on a schedule of every 4 days for three treatments 180 mg/kg per injection on days 4 8 and 12 after implantation total dose 540 mg/kg results were compared with those for paclitaxel taxol every 2 days for six treatments 7.5 mg/kg per injection mice were weighed daily and tumors were measured 2 to 3 times per week for the mice maintained on the folate-deficient diet appreciable antitumor activity was recorded with compound 1 t c of 0 on day 21 t x02212 c 13 days 1.4 gross log kill fig 8 exceeding that for paclitaxel t c 16 0.8 gross log kill antitumor drug efficacy for 1 was completely abolished 99 t c for the standard folate-replete diet the treatment regimen was well tolerated with dose-limiting symptoms manifesting as reversible body weight loss for mice maintained on the folate-deficient diet results for the in vivo efficacy experiment shown in fig 8 are summarized in supplemental table 3s the results of the in vivo efficacy trial demonstrate potent antitumor activity for compound 1 toward subcutaneously engrafted hepg2 tumors associated with significant transport by hpcft and a lack of membrane transport by hrfc in this study we significantly expand upon previous reports zhao and goldman 2007 kugel desmoulin et al. 2010b suggesting that pcft may be therapeutically exploitable for treating solid tumors we found that hpcft like hrfc was widely and highly expressed in an extensive panel of human solid tumor cell lines but not in human leukemias another group showed that low ph transport activity of mtx was prominent in human tumor cell lines zhao et al. 2004 in direct support of the findings reported herein twelve of the human sublines were included in both studies and for these there was reasonable correlation between hpcft and hrfc transcript levels and transport activity at ph 5.5 and 7.4 respectively we further show that the novel 6-substituted pyrrolo 2,3- d pyrimidine thienoyl antifolate compound 1 can be selectively transported by hpcft in a ph- and time-dependent manner the tumor models employed r1-11-pcft4 hela and hepg2 cells express similar levels of hpcft although they differ in the presence of hrfc and fr x003b1 the premise behind our drug discovery efforts exemplified by compound 1 is that membrane transport of cytotoxic antifolates is a critical determinant of antitumor drug selectivity compound 1 is not transported by the ubiquitously expressed rfc wang et al. 2010 this is particularly important because drugs such as compound 1 that target fr x003b1 and/or pcft yet are not substrates for rfc have the potential to selectively target tumor cells and decrease toxicity to normal tissues this is a substantial advantage over chemotherapy drugs currently in use indeed pursuing the development of these novel antifolates could yield a new class of clinically relevant antitumor agents our previous work used engineered cho models as well as kb nasopharyngeal and igrov1 ovarian human tumor cells that express fr x003b1 and/or hpcft to deliver cytotoxic antifolates including compound 1 that are not substrates for hrfc deng et al. 2008 2009 wang et al. 2010 the present report significantly expands upon this concept by demonstrating exclusive transport of compound 1 by hpcft into human tumor cell lines at ph values characterizing the tumor microenvironment for r1-11-pcft4 and hepg2 cells after its internalization at ph 6.8 compound 1 was extensively polyglutamylated such that the predominant metabolite was the pentaglutamate form compound 1 conjugated to 4 glutamate residues moreover compound 1 potently inhibited garftase leading to r1-11-pcft4 hela cell death in vitro and hepg2 tumor growth delay in vivo expression of hpcft transcripts and protein in normal human tissues is more restrictive than for hrfc high hpcft levels being observed in the liver kidney and small intestine and very low levels in the bone marrow and colon kugel desmoulin et al. 2010a this pattern of pcft transcripts was generally observed in mouse tissues qiu et al. 2007 our finding that hpcft transcripts are low in human bone marrow kugel desmoulin et al. 2010a is particularly significant and suggests that hpcft-targeted therapeutics may be less marrow toxic than antifolates presently in clinical use the microenvironments for most normal tissues probably exhibit a neutral ph martin and jain 1994 such that even if pcft is present the electrochemical proton gradient is reduced leading to less accumulation of pcft substrates such as compound 1 conversely rfc would exhibit a far greater activity under these conditions this when combined with the greater capacity of rfc to transport reduced folates across the cell membrane compared with pcft zhao et al. 2008 would result in elevated levels of cellular folates in normal tissues the increased availability of reduced folates would result in competition with internalized antifolates for polyglutamylation and/or for binding to intracellular drug targets e.g. garftase thus protecting normal cells from drug cytotoxicity likewise for pcft-targeted agents in solid tumors if sufficient rfc were present enough transport of folates might occur even at slightly acidic ph values to decrease drug efficacy on this basis this implies that the ratio of pcft to rfc in tumors is critical to antitumor activities of pcft-selective cytotoxic antifolates and that mtx-resistant tumors that have substantially lost rfc function may be exquisitely sensitive to the effects of pcft-selective drugs such as compound 1 thus for compound 1 and related agents tumor selectivity is not only reliant upon differential pcft levels between normal tissues and solid tumors but is also affected by interstitial ph and activity of rfc another consideration involves the purine salvage pathway methylthioadenosine phosphorylase mtap is an enzyme that releases adenine and 5-deoxy-5- methylthio ribose-1-phosphate from methylthioadenosine formed during polyamine biosynthesis illei et al. 2003 adenine is used in purine salvage and 5-deoxy-5- methylthio ribose-1-phosphate is subsequently recycled to methionine whereas mtap has been reported to be abundantly expressed in normal tissues in many solid tumors the mtap gene is codeleted with cdkn2a encodes p16ink4a illei et al. 2003 thus many solid tumors are deficient in purine salvage and functional purine salvage in normal tissues would theoretically protect cells from cell death caused by garftase inhibition increasing tumor cell selectivity for agents such as compound 1 hori et al. 1996 it is interesting that under nearly the same conditions the ic 50 for garftase inhibition in r1-11-pcft4 cells by the in situ garftase assay is virtually identical to the ic 50 for inhibition of cell proliferation this result differs somewhat from our previous finding with an analogous 6-substituted pyrrolo 2,3- d pyrimidine benozyl antifolate in cho cells for which the ic 50 for garftase inhibition was substantially lower suggesting that sustained garftase inhibition was necessary to manifest as cytotoxicity kugel desmoulin et al. 2010b this quantitative difference may reflect differences in the size of purine pools between the human and hamster sublines such that r1-11-pcft4 hela cells would be more sensitive to the inhibition of garftase of course other factors could also contribute for instance differences in drug polyglutamylation and polyglutamate turnover could result in disparate potencies for sustained garftase inhibition in different cell lines finally our studies with compound 1 assess the impact of garftase inhibition on atp levels and the mechanism s of tumor cell death treatment of r1-11-pcft4 cells with compound 1 substantially reduced atp levels and caused s-phase accumulation apoptosis resulting from compound 1 was reduced compared with etoposide this could at least in part reflect the requirement of atp for apoptosis because atp levels must be maintained above a minimal level for apoptosis induction tsujimoto 1997 in conclusion our in vitro studies suggest the feasibility of using hpcft and the acidic tumor microenvironment to selectively deliver a novel pcft-targeted antifolate to human solid tumors our in vivo results with hepg2 tumor cells that express only hpcft and hrfc provide compelling proof-of-principle validation and rationale for developing drugs whose transport by pcft but not rfc allows for garftase
