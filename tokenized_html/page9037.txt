chase field stadium tours with photos top 20 places to stay for chase field stadium tours vacation rentals vacation homes airbnb in phoenix kendra s place was perfect for my needs attending a conference downtown it was only a 10-minute walk from the conference hotel and much more affordable but what really made it such a welcoming experience was kendra s hospitality she went over and above providing snacks and fruit coffee drinks etc. that were all available for me as well as some great restaurant recommendations for when i was on my own for dinners the room was spotless and had lots of nice touches she thought of everything and made me feel very welcome yet not intruded on in the least she also kindly accommodated an early arrival for me and had quick turnaround on all communication

blast starting 1st friday from here and could trolley all around from about a block away super quiet and comfortable space and was surprised to have the 2 bathrooms will definitely return thanks krista great place perfect for any adventure downtown entire home/apt condominium 6 1 phoenix az united states our check in instructions were incredibly unclear and confusing our thought was that the copy-and-paste style message got choppy and was not proof read the bed is a memory foam style if you are unfamiliar with these there are extremely hard until broken in and can be very warm in temperature this can lead to restless sleep phoenix is typically hot so i can understand not wanting to take a hot shower however our visit had temperatures in the 50 s and 60 s so a hot shower would have been excellent unfortunately there is zero hot water available we allowed the water to run for several minutes without any success -being a new place i have suggested these changes to this host great location easy walk to the convention center great place very convenient location i was in town for a conference and it x27 s walking distance to the convention center and good restaurants loved staying here everybody was super friendly and accommodating came to town for a couple of baseball games with my teenaged son great location easy 10 minute walk to the stadium loved sitting out on the balcony in the evenings with a cold beverage bed is firm overall apartment is very stylish big kitchen would definitely stay here again very clean apartment and just as described it was a little confusing at first that the key to is located in a lock box in the parking next door but the instructions are detailed so that helped the apartment had everything needed to prepare a meal and relax watching television thank you you will not be disappointed the place is really close to downtown like chase field pizzeria bianco and the convention center the apartment is clean has good design choices and is easy to get into i would recommend staying here huge and stylish apartment love the decor and thoughtful touches inside big balcony with seating outside and easy access to building and parking would definitely stay again entire home/apt apartment 3 1 phoenix az united states super clean great communication and overall a great place to stay we loved the clarity of directions for check in and check out cleanliness amenities communication throughout our stay and friendliness we highly recommend domino and his place efficient and a bit charmless experience this place was awesome for my family and i good location beautiful space and they were really responsive one of our favorite parts was the gym it was accessible and clean and kept my wife and my routine going we have stayed at about a dozen places using airbnb and this has been right up there with one of our favorites because of how clean it was and the value we got thank you for being a great host very nice very clean nice area and secure parking could have used a few more towels for the length we stayed and amount of guests but all in all a very positive experience if you want to watch tv make sure you are willing to use your own devices domio only provides a smart tv assuming everyone has subscriptions to netflix hulu etc they aren x27 t hooked up to cable or satellite tv we were very unhappy about this make sure you don x27 t mind traffic noise our unit was located right next to washington street with constant traffic and trains the unit was pretty clean but the master bedroom toilet needed attention and there were black hairs left on the shower drain .gross also don x27 t be surprised if the code they give you for the front door doesn x27 t work ours didn x27 t. thank goodness they provided a key too very modern and beautiful space easy walk to the convention center domio s was perfect it was a very modern and stylish but it felt like home kitchen was well equipped great location would definitely stay again if you x27 re in phoenix for anything around the convention center or sports complex this place can x27 t be beat walking distance and super nice including a community bbq and patio with a pool the apartment itself is tasteful and comfortable and they bed was great entire home/apt apartment 5 2 phoenix az united states one really amazing place to stay my folks loved their stay here and if ever given another opportunity to come to az they would absolutely want to stay here again ☺️ i highly highly recommend this place for a good time with closed one in a cute space great place fantastic hostesses neighborhood is trendy and fun but certainly in transition and still a bit rough around the edges recommended for street smart folks lise nina x27 s place was spotless and came with a fully equipped kitchen the location was perfect for our conference at the phoenix convention center and was a short walk or quick uber/lyft ride away from the downtown area it is right next to the road and you can hear vehicle and foot traffic but the area was mostly quiet overall we would consider staying here again in the future while attending a conference very well decorated cool loft great location within walking distance of downtown and very clean there was easy parking available for one car street parking for more they had anything you might need during your stay such as coffee snacks and shower supplies lise nina were great at communicating with us leading up to our arrival and detailing where to park next to the house would definitely stay here again if ever in phoenix again awesome location less than 5 min away from downtown stylish decor made the stay feel homey parking was a breeze street available right in front or specific spot at the back door the fire station accross the street hardly notice and we stayed 5 days if you taller than 5 x27 6 watch you head going up the stairs to the loft both beds were comfortable ac worked great overall had a great stay and would definitely come back to the polk street hideaway lisa nina were very helpful quick to respond and the space was great i would definitely consider staying again if i x27 m in the phoenix area beautiful loft in a perfect down town setting truly lovely hosts business or pleasure this is a wonderful place to call home for travelers i x27 ve stayed in airbnbs in several countries around the world and across the usa lisa and nina x27 s loft was among one of the best i x27 ve ever stayed in spectacularly clean stylish will you please come and decorate my home cozy a true home away from home too many special touches like a french press which i use daily at home shower supplies coffee tea and creamer etc they thought of everything i only had a few minutes to spend outside cause i was busy at a conference most of the time but they x27 ve created a serene oasis in the desert i live in a residential neighborhood in the heart of a downtown area in south florida so i x27 m used to some noise from cars and the airport if you have a sensitivity to that just throw in some ear plugs in your bag it it a super convenient location and i walked daily to downtownin under 10 minutes you don x27 t want to miss this place entire home/apt townhouse 4 2 phoenix az united states outstanding hospitality it x27 s easy to see why these two are super house would highly recommend this location for a convention or anything occurring downtown phoenix great place to stay an easy walk or short ride share to/from downtown area nice roomy and quiet place to relax during a busy conference week much more enjoyable than a hotel experience great house to stay very clean and confortable is in downtown a few minutes of the stadium wonderful accommodations by downtown phoenix six people stayed comfortably and the extra perks of coffee and fruit were extremely nice would stay again when coming back into town we spent a week here for to visit family over christmas kimberly and santiago responded quickly when we had questions before reserving the property and they gave us clear detailed info for our self check-in the house location is amazing it x27 s in a small residential area right in the heart of downtown which makes it a definite perk to have free off-street parking in the driveway and garage the house is very clean nicely decorated and functional the thoughtful hosts welcomed us with a vase of fresh flowers and a generous supply of snacks and beverages our family of four had everything we needed for our long stay -plenty of towels bedding bath supplies and kitchen equipment the rooms are all large and the beds are comfortable phoenix had a cold spell while we were there and the heater worked well the house layout is great the master bedroom is on one side of the large living room area with the second and third bedrooms are down a hallway on the other side the second bathroom is in between the two bedrooms both bathrooms are surprisingly large and have double sinks we didn x27 t use the patio much but the furniture looked comfortable and the backyard is huge and nicely kept with a pretty view of downtown buildings overall it x27 s a great place to stay and even nicer than the pictures we will definitely recommend it for friends and family coming to the area really great place to stay at their home was wonderful and very clean the beds were very comfortable and cozy when we arrived i was really thirsty they had water and other cold beverages in the refrigerator which was really nice they provided snacks and bananas our family cooks and they had spices and cooking oils and fully stocked kitchen for people that cook they had enough utensils glasses and plates i liked how they equipped us with coffee and the creams as we are definitely

angelica was super responsive to every message the house was very clean the location is convenient to all things downtown however there is a lock on the air conditioner it x27 s phoenix in the summer come on i understand a/c bills can get expensive that x27 s call the price of doing business raise the nightly rate by 10-15 dollars in the summer but don x27 t lock us out of the a/c and make us sweat while we sleep and find somewhere else to be in the evening because it x27 s too warm in the house you rented to hang out in it also the refrigerator barely worked it says 33 degrees on the outside but everything inside is room temperature to slightly cool i have the exact same fridge mine says 37 on the outside and everything inside is very cold these two things pretty much ruined what could have been the very best airbnb i x27 ve ever stayed in this house has so much potential since it x27 s a really nice house but without ac and a working fridge it x27 s just a shell could x27 ve stayed at a motel 6 for half the cost angelica x27 s place was extremely convenient easy to find easy to check in to very close to downtown well stocked with supplies excellent shower and bath set up

feeling of security mary and i found the description of the listing quite accurate and chris responded quickly and professionally to any of our queries the condo was spacious beds were comfortable and it came reasonably well equipped we enjoyed the hot tub and pool after a long hike and we found the location safe the central downtown location made it very easy to get around as well as providing access to major roadways the condo itself could use an aesthetic makeover as we found the carpeting and kitchen cabinets very worn and looking quite dirty and old one of my best airbnb experiences to date the condo was clean spacious and affordable best of all it was so close to downtown that i could walk to many place christopher was great to communicate with and prepared me well for check in i
