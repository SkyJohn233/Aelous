s best deals on the best products photo anker amazon — our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need if you make a purchase by clicking one of our links we may earn a small share of the revenue however our picks and opinions are independent from usa today s newsroom and any business incentives looking to do a little shopping to get you through that mid-week slump frankly amazon 's deals are not super thrilling today most of the offers in the gold box are on products from unheard-of brands with either low or fake ratings that or the deals are n't actually as good as they seem but i managed to find a handful of diamonds in the rough that you might be interested in these are all highly rated personally used or professionally tested products we are confident you 'll enjoy especially at their discounted prices faster charging and stronger cables make life a little more convenient photo anker anker 's braided powerline+ charging cables are great not only does the braided cord prevent tangles and fraying but the cables are durable and they charge your device as fast or faster than the cord that came with it right now anker has discounts on its 6-foot usb-c and 3-foot lightning cables that knock the price down below 10 i have a lot of these cables in my home with a collection of every cord my guests could ever need in our living room to phone charging cables in the bed that are long enough to use comfortably it 's a serious game changer i 'd recommend getting the 3-foot cables if you 're an apple user in need of a desktop charging setup or have a charging station that came with a super slow charger the 6-foot cables are perfect for using usb-c devices while they 're charging whether on the couch or in bed for under 20 this is the perfect replacement for your old worn-out cookware photo t-fal the t-fal line is one of those affordable-but-good cookware brands i 've been using the same t-fal pots and pans for years and they 're
