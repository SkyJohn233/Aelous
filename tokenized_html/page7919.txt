section 1 out of 29 on location canada extends video footage recommend 2 out of 29 on location ohio only took a few minutes to install only thing that was easy about the system 3 out of 29 on location oregon installation was simple the entire system came back up when power was reestablished i formatted the drive and everything functions as expected 4 out of 29 on location exton pa hard disk of my original dvr that i purchased in 2014 went bad a month ago i was exploring options to replace the dvr itself but calling customer service i was advised to get both hard drive and dvr to check it out i decided to replace the hard drive first and it turned out pretty easy to replace there were just 4 screws to unscrew and two cables to take out it was that easy the only slight challenge i had was to figure out where the screws were and after looking around the dvr box i figured out they are at the bottom lorex has generous return policy as they were accepting returns in 60 days and included return return shipping br it has been couple weeks and hard disk seems to be working just fine hope it lasts longer than my original one by the way the disks are available at other retailers too so if you want to go for price comparison make sure that you are buying a conpatible surveillance hard disk and not the ones that go in computers 5 out of 29 on location illinois installation was easy a high quality properly sized phillips screwdriver makes taking the cover off the nvr easy after i opened the hdd package i noticed there were no mounting screws and no sata cable since i was adding a hard drive this became an issue i swapped out the old drive with the new formatted it and away we went works just fine and i am pleased br a ticket submission via email landed me a case number i followed up with a phone call and found out that it was errant for me to think screws sata cable come with the hard drive in fact they do not i was informed these accessories are available for purchase at costco home depot and best buy a note on the website product description would be nice 6 out of 29 on location kansas very easy to install had some issues but tech support was great and all issues have been resolved if you are looking to upgrade an existing dvr for more storage this is definitely the way to go 7 out of 29 on location arizona the assistance process of diagnosing that the hard drive was bad was excellent i got a rapid response to my question on what was the largest went from 1 terabyte to 4 terabyte capacity hard drive i could install in the recording system the only issue i had was the written directions i received for resetting the hard drive as a troubleshooting procedure differed from the directions in the unit s manual for replacing the hard drive i opted to follow the replacement procedure found in the manual and the recording unit started normally formatted hard drive per instructions and the parameters for recording were inputted with no issues tested that each camera activated the recorder when motion occurred for the area that each covers as a non-technical senior citizen i can honestly say that if an individual can use a screw driver and follow written instruction the process is quick and easy 8 out of 29 on location ks easy to install 9 out of 29 on location wisconsin my experience with lorex products and support has been top notch i ve had a lorex 8 channel system about 6 years and have been very pleased with the performance the system has already proven to be a smart investment a neighbor s car was stolen and my

tech support with any questions or troubleshooting they have been professional my dvr recently failed and lorex was quick to offer a replacement at a very reasonable reduced price since my unit was out of warranty i ve decided to upgrade my 2 terabyte hard drive with a 4 terabyte drive for additional recorded time documentation from the dvr manual assisted with the easy installation of the upgraded 4 terabyte hard drive now i can take longer vacations and feel comfortable the lorex system has enough recording time for capturing any odd activities around the house 10 out of 29 on

drive used the live chat widget to get the installation instructions installing the drive was easy following instructions flir cloud on my smart phones did not work had to call support to get issue resolved support was excellent also began using a laptop cooling pad to keep unit cooler no problems so far after one month 14 out of 29 on location austin ordered this along with the included 2tb drive in a bundle system arrived separately packaged so prepare to install yourself i am familiar with doing so and so it wasn t a big deal they included the hardware and cabling needed to install an additional drive it was recognized at boot and added to the system without any configuration so that was nice would have nice to have it already installed when the system shipped but as long as you are comfortable opening up the system and installing the drive and connecting the two cables yourself it isn t a big deal 15 out of 29 on location va very easy to install an additional hard drive thanks 16 out of 29 on location indiana easy to install great product great price lorex does eveything to help you if you have problems 17 out of 29 on location california i received the 4 terabyte

california i installed my 4 tb as per the video and it didn t boot up hard drive is doa i called support and they will send me out another one can t seem to get any kind of acknowledgement on when the new one will ship very unsatisfied morning john br we can see that an sap number was created only a few days ago for your replacement drive the drive should be shipped soon now that the holidays have passed br take care 20 out of 29 on location new york purchased this hd to augment the storage capability of the rather short capacity 3 tb hard drive that came with the nvr installation was quite easy in spite of no install instructions being supplied with the drive performance from the get go was very good and it did what it was supposed to do when the nvr was replaced under warranty the transfer to the replacement nvr was easy however the new nvr only has room for two hard drives next replacement hd will be the 6 tb size br would recommend this drive 21 out of 29 on location western ma unfortunately i am unable to rate the performance of this hard drive as i can not install it due to the missing items but i can tell you that they have the worse customer service i have ever experienced i was shocked when i received this hard drive as the packing job was pretty bad it was placed in a large box with very little packing material allowing it to bounce around inside this box br in both cases i received two products missing very small items and they failed miserably i get it that from time to time items will be missing and have experienced this several times in my life but the difference is when you call other companies and tell them your issue they send out the needed items no problem these folks just seem to create far more work for themselves by running you around in circles getting no where so by doing this and not sending me these items that may totaled less than five dollars in parts they have turned my 2,000.00 purchase into something that could have been an excellent experience into a nightmare sad part is i read numerous complaints about how bad their customer service is and thought no way could it be that bad and yes way it is hi chloe br i apologize about the experience you ve faced when something like this occurs our customer service department usually replaces it once proof is provided once again i do apologize if this was not the case when you had contacted us there has been a request to have someone from customer support contact you directly to resolve this immediately 22 out of 29 on location mesa it was worth the long wait for the 4tb replacement part it was easy to install and format after reading the dvr manual instructions it gives me the piece of mind to know that the video history will still be available from long vacations away from home 23 out of 29 on location toledo ohio i ordered this additional hard drive to expand the capacity of my nvr the installation was relatively self-explanatory and did not require much time the online instruction manual i downloaded was from an older model nvr but gave me enough info figure it out start to finish the installation process was approximately 15 minutes 24 out of 29 on location ca definitely happy i bought this product only had 1tb before purchase fast shipping easy to replace love the warranty price was reasonable to would definitely recommend lorex has also been great with any issues i ve had since i ve had the surveillance system 25 out of 29 on location toledo ohio i ordered an additional hard drive to expand the capacity of our nvr the installation instructions are easy to follow and this was much more efficient solution vs. having an additional external hard drive lorex support was helpful in the decision making process 26 out of 29 on location ks i ordered an additional hard drive to add to our nvr it was easy to add and now allows us to have about 11 days of continuous recordings instead of just 3 27 out of 29 on location findley lake ny this hard drive is very easy to install i had no problems at all i like recording continuous footage from my cameras so i needed a bigger hard drive 28 out of 29 on location washington ct this hard drive literally was completely installed in 15 minutes i found a youtube video of a guy installing the same drive in his lorex system the screws and blue jumper are provided with the unit so all i had to do was unwrap everything take the screws out of the back of the cabinet pop in the new hard drive and it was done i bought this additional hard drive because the website said my nvr only came with 1tb i was happy to find i had a 2tb hard drive when i opened the unit up would have been nice to know this upfront .. p 29 out of 29 on location los angeles ca usa i received this 2tb hard drive and it would not initialize when i installed it in my dvr and that made me an unhappy customer the inability to reach either customer or technical service via phone and slow inconclusive responses via the ticketing system with no resolution in sight after six weeks has been very frustrating to say the least and now i am a completely dissatisfied customer br i can not understand how an international company can not provide service and satisfaction to resolve such a simple issue as issuing a return authorization and subsequent refund for a 100 item against 600 merchandise i purchased i understand hardware equipment can fail but really how does the human element of customer service fail in such a spectacular way br i give this hard drive a single star rating because that is the minimum score required to post a review our apologies for any difficulty you experienced we have provided you with a return authorization lnr100 compatibility was wondering if this 4tb hard drive will fit in my lnr1141tc23b camera system with a lnr100 hard drive yes lnr1141tc23b supports up to 1 x 4tb hard drive 4tb hard drive manufacturer was wondering if the 4tb hard drive you offer is the western digital wd40purx was looking for additional info on it this drive is made by western digital size of hard drive how and why is the size of the drive limited anyway to improve the size most of the models support a max of 4tb hard drive it s a firmware limitation hdd4tb-d compatible with lorex eco4 960h is our lorex eco4 960h compatible with this hdd4tb-d no the eco4 series dvr support a maximum of 2tb hard drives i am purchasing the nr9163 system with 16 cameras total to be installed can you connect 2 4tb hard drives total 11 tb with the nr 3tb hard drive included the nr9163 has only two hard drive bays meaning that you can connect only 2 hard drives this product doesn t have any answered questions be the first one to ask the question did not find an answer to your question answer_text available
