metabolomics june 2016 12:100 cite as traumatic brain injury tbi is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function evaluate the use of metabolomics for the development of biomarkers of tbi for the diagnosis and timing of injury onset a validated model of closed injury tbi was employed using 10 tbi mice and 8 sham operated controls quantitative lc–ms/ms metabolomic analysis was performed on the serum thirty-six 24.0 of 150 metabolites were altered with tbi principal component analysis pca and partial least squares discriminant analysis pls-da analyses revealed clear segregation between tbi versus control sera the combination of methionine sulfoxide and the lipid pc aa c34:4 accurately diagnosed tbi auc 95 ci 0.85 0.644–1.0 a combination of metabolite markers were highly accurate in distinguishing early 4 h post tbi from late 24 h tbi auc 95 ci 1.0 1.0–1.0 spermidine which is known to have an antioxidant effect and which is known to be metabolically disrupted in tbi was the most discriminating biomarker based on the variable importance ranking in projection vip plot several important metabolic pathways were found to be disrupted including pathways for arginine proline glutathione cysteine and sphingolipid metabolism using serum metabolomic analysis we were able to identify novel putative serum biomarkers of tbi they were accurate for detecting and determining the timing of tbi in addition pathway analysis provided important insights into the biochemical mechanisms of brain injury potential clinical implications for diagnosis timing and monitoring brain injury are discussed the online version of this article doi 10.1007/s11306-016-1044-3 contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users traumatic brain injury tbi is a complex disorder that is highly significant due to its frequency associated mortality and long term medical financial and social consequences corso et al 2006 moreover all demographic groups are at risk overall rates in the usa are 579 cases per 100,000 persons which corresponds to approximately 1.7 million cases each year faul et al 2006 as a consequence of the steady decline in early deaths due to tbi faul et al 2006 langlois et al 2004 disability resulting from tbi is an increasing concern longitudinal data estimates suggest that approximately 3.17 million people in the usa fall into this category zaloshnja et al 2008 the reported potential link between recurrent tbi and chronic traumatic encephalopathy in professional football players omalu et al 2005 has led to an unparalleled level of coverage of tbi in the lay media there has been a long standing interest in serum for biomarkers of tbi the potential value of biomarkers is widely recognized as they can assist with the diagnosis the elucidation of the mechanisms of brain injury following tbi the monitoring of disease progression the identification of complications prognostication and new therapeutic options mondello and hayes 2015 metabolomics has been extensively used to discover biomarkers and to provide insight into the pathogenesis of complex brain disorders graham et al 2013a b 2014 2016 jove et al 2014 pan et al 2016 we recently reported the use of nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy to identify brain biomarkers in a closed tbi mouse model bahado-singh et al 2016 in that study we found evidence of profound disturbances in mitochondrial function neurotransmitter excitation and oxidative stress imbalance in tbi brains compared to the brains of control mice while brain metabolite analysis provides important and direct information on the impact of tbi on the primary affected organ it does have significant limitations in the usual clinical context direct access to brain tissue is severely limited some of the brain biomarkers we identified in our study are known to be measureable non-invasively using mri however significant hurdles related to cost and access largely preclude the frequent and repeated use of mri for monitoring the average tbi patient this is often the case with mild tbi which constitutes the overwhelming majority of cases the damage in tbi is longitudinal and progressive after the initial trauma therefore serial measurement of metabolite levels would be the preferred route to properly profile the ongoing damage to monitor treatment response and to make an accurate prognosis herein lies the advantage of blood-based biomarkers which can be repeatedly accessed at relatively low cost and effort indeed this is why there is such wide ongoing interest in identifying blood biomarkers for tbi neher et al 2014 in this study we used lc–ms/ms based metabolomics to identify potential serum biomarkers for tbi a well-standardized and previously reported tbi mouse closed head injury model of tbi flierl et al 2009 was used serum from the animals used in a previous investigation was analyzed for this study bahado-singh et al 2016 here we report the results of our lc–ms/ms analysis whilst nmr based metabolomics was used in the prior study to investigate changes in post-mortem brain tissue while there is some overlap the two platforms identify substantially different metabolites psychogios et al 2011 the technique of inducing tbi and the description of the preparation monitoring and euthanizing of the animals were as previously reported bahado-singh et al 2016 flierl et al 2009 the study was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the university of colorado iacug protocol number b-79612 01 1e following iauac approval the mice were sacrificed using terminal anesthesia and exsanguination for euthanasia blood was obtained by cardiac puncture just prior to decapitation serum was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000× g for 10 min at 4 °c and the serum was separated and stored at −80 °c targeted quantitative metabolomic analysis of the serum was performed by combining direct injection mass spectrometry with a reverse-phase lc–ms/ms kit absoluteidq™ kit biocrates life sciences austria as we previously reported bahado-singh et al 2014 in combination with an abi 4000 q-trap applied biosystems/mds sciex mass spectrometer it is possible to accurately identify and quantify up to 180 different endogenous metabolites these metabolites include amino acids acylcarnitines biogenic amines glycerophospholipids sphingolipids and sugars in the mouse serum n 2 metabolite concentrations are expressed as μm metabolites that were found to be significantly different p 0.05 between sham and tbi mice were analyzed using the pathway topology search tool in metaboanalyst v 3.0 xia et al 2009 2012 2015 the mus musculus mouse library pathway was utilized fisher s exact test was used for over-representation analysis and relative betweeness centrality was chosen for the pathway topology testing a holm corrected p value and false discovery rate p value 0.05 were used to identify pathways altered due to the tbi heatmaps were produced using the statistical analysis tool in metaboanalyst v 3.0 xia et al 2009 2012 2015 the data were normalized to the median and range scaled for the heatmap analyses the distance measure was euclidean and ward s cluster algorithm was used bahado et al 2016 the tbi group sacrificed at 4 h early after trauma and those sacrificed at 24 h late were compared the overall tbi early late group was also compared to sham operated controls log transformation and pareto scaling were used to normalize the data mean and sd of metabolite concentrations were compared between the groups principal component analysis pca partial least squares discriminant analysis pls-da a variable importance ranking in projection analysis vip were performed using a subset of metabolites that had a p value 0.3 based on univariate comparisons for the generated pls-da model permutation testing was performed to determine the statistical likelihood that the observed separation is either due to chance or real differences between cases and controls this was accomplished by randomly relabeling the data and by rerunning the pls-da analysis permutation testing with 2000 repetitions were performed to establish whether the observed discrimination between the groups was statistically significant wishart 2010 xia et al 2009 only the top metabolites n 15 as displayed in the vip plot were listed for the comparison of each metabolite the pvalues were calculated using a mann–whitney u test p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant bonferroni corrected p value 0.0003 was used for multiple testing correction in addition the q-value or fdr was used to determine significance p 0.05 logistic regression analysis was used to determine the optimal metabolite combination for tbi prediction predictor variables used were limited to those with pvalue 0.3 based on univariate comparisons variable selection methods using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso tibshirani 1996 was used and stepwise variable selection in the logistic regression calculation was employed to optimize the model components hastie et al 2009 a k-fold cross-validation cv technique was used to ensure that the logistic regression models were robust xia et al 2013 in k-fold cv the entire sample is randomly divided into k equal sized subsets of the k subsets only one subset is used as the validation data for testing the model and the remaining k − 1 subsets are used as training set to generate the model the end result is a robust optimal and parsimonious biomarker model the predictive ability of the model is then tested independently on the validation group which was not used in model generation the performance of the model over these rounds is then averaged the five-fold cross-validation cv with lasso was used to determine the final set of coefficients and variables to be included in the model inclusion in the model required that a given predictor be selected 4 times out of the 5 cv exercises the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve auroc or auc and sensitivity and specificity values were also calculated xia et al 2013 in the case of tbi prediction it may be better to over predict this translates to maximizing sensitivity providing the best results so both the threshold or cutoff values of the generated logistic regression model for maximized sensitivity and the best sum of sensitivity and specificity were considered univariate comparisons of serum metabolites tbi versus sham controls

considered to be significantly affected p 0.05 fdr 0.05 in our analysis of tbi mice we identified serum biomarkers that accurately discriminate tbi cases from sham operated controls significant changes in the concentrations of thirty-six of a total of 150 24.0 metabolites were observed after tbi correspondingly there were statistically significant differences in a number of important metabolic pathways in the serum of tbi mice these include arginine and proline metabolism glutathione metabolism cysteine and methionine metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism a combination of pc aa c34:4 and methionine sulfoxide was found to accurately distinguish tbi from sham operated mice with an auc 95 ci 0.85 0.664–1.0 furthermore a combination of six metabolites methionine sulfoxide c3 sm c18:0 sm c18:1 methionine and proline accurately discriminated early from late tbi auc 95 ci 1.0 1.0–1.0 these biomarkers could be very useful for ascertaining the timing of tbi we previously reported significant differences in the brain of tbi mice as compared to sham controls bahado-singh et al 2016 in the brain extracts amp nad+ adp and imp were the most discriminating metabolites between tbi and sham controls while in serum spermidine methionine sulfoxide lysopcac20:3 c18:1 and proline were the most powerful predictors of tbi mitochondrial dysfunction appeared to be the principal feature of the alterations in brain tissue pathway analysis also confirmed the different effects of tbi on the brain metabolome versus the serum metabolome in the brain we noted that purine alanine glutathione valine and tyrosine pathways were among the metabolic pathways that were most affected this appeared to be in contrast to what was noted in the serum table 4 with glutathione being the only pathway that appeared to be altered in common between the two tissues however it is important to reemphasize that the use of two different metabolomics platforms i.e nmr for brain tissue lc–ms/ms for serum with different metabolite detection capabilities and differing metabolite sensitivities may contribute significantly to the observed tissue/biofluid differences and limits our ability to draw definitive conclusions on this issue there is obvious clinical utility in the identification and validation of serum metabolite markers for the detection of tbi currently the majority of tbi cases approximately 60 are thought to remain undiagnosed estimates suggest that this is as much as 60 boswell et al 2002 failure to diagnose tbi is a particular risk for athletes particularly at high school college and professional levels these individuals are known to often deny or downplay concussive trauma in order to maintain playing time a high frequency of failed diagnosis has also been described in the military the heavy reliance on patient self-reporting to make the diagnosis is a particular challenge in the military when one takes into consideration the loss of consciousness and post-traumatic amnesia which attend such trauma the non-specificity and frequency of associated symptoms in the general military population such as depression and anxiety is a further confounder and heightens the need for objective markers for the diagnosis in the military and indeed among all tbi groups bass et al 2012 chapman and diaz-arrastia 2014 given the risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy from repeated concussions stein et al 2014 improving diagnostic capabilities becomes a critical issue metabolites could potentially make an important contribution to addressing this challenge an additional finding of our study was that a combination of six serum metabolites sensitively discriminated tbi based on the timing of the injury while the number of cases was small the signal was unusually strong and appears to be statistically quite significant the timing of tbi may have clinical value in determining the original onset of trauma this is particularly important among the elderly in nursing homes and for monitoring the progress of a patient s brain injury and recovery one practical benefit to monitoring injury progression and resolution could include for example the development of objective standards for determining the appropriate time of return to play for athletes who have suffered concussions at present this remains an unresolved and a contentious issue the pathway analysis provided important insights into the cellular mechanisms of injury in tbi especially from the perspective of events taking place in serum the most significant changes appeared to occur in the arginine and proline metabolic pathway arginine decarboxylate adc is a rate limiting enzyme in the decarboxylation of arginine to agmatine agmatine is a protective neurotransmitter and exogenous agmatine has a neuroprotective effect in animal models of neurotrauma in spinal cord injury adc facilitates the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factors it also reduces neurodegeneration and is said to accelerate neuronal recovery park et al 2015 elevated levels of arginine were noted at 24 h compared to 4 h supplementary table 1 glutathione plays a well-recognized role in antioxidant defense mechanisms we observed a significant alteration of glutathione metabolism in our study cysteine contributes to glutathione synthesis and increased production of glutathione is induced by increased cysteine levels this is an important mechanism for the removal of excess cysteine www.hmdb.ca oxidative stress has long been known to be partly responsible for the neuronal damage in tbi hall et al 1993 indeed biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidant levels have been found to correlate with trauma severity and also predict neurologic outcomes in humans wang et al 2015 the abnormalities of cysteine and glutathione metabolism that we found are consistent with these prior reports methionine sulfoxide is another oxidative stress marker this amino acid is a byproduct of methionine oxidation and can therefore be regarded as a biomarker of oxidative stress in vivo www.hmdb.ca we found that methionine sulfoxide was a good predictor of tbi it was however significantly decreased in tbi versus control cases interestingly we also noted that the concentrations of methionine sulfoxide significantly increased over time after tbi perhaps reflecting increasing post-traumatic oxidative stress in the sub-acute phase of the injury we also found a significant disturbance of sphingolipid metabolism neural membranes contain significant amounts of lipids including sphingolipids and phospholipids they are thought to be precursors of lipids involved in signal transduction sphingolipids play an important role in neural cell proliferation and apoptosis and are known to support oxidative stress involved in neurologic disorders such as in head and spinal injuries farooqui et al 2007 serum sphingolipids may therefore contribute to oxidative damage in tbi or arise from oxidative damage from tbi altura et al 2002 serum spermidine levels were also significantly increased in tbi mice versus sham operated controls fig 1 spermidine and spermine are cations that play an important role in maintaining dna structure and function through their roles as immune modulators and antioxidants tbi results in disruption of spermidine-spermine homeostasis leading to production of metabolites that cause ongoing post-traumatic injury zahedi et al 2010 overall these findings further support the role of oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses in propagating and controlling respectively ongoing neuronal damage post brain trauma in comparison with a previously reported investigation conducted by our group using the same animal cohort which focused on the brain metabolome bahado-singh et al 2016 glutathione metabolism was the only pathway found to be significantly disturbed p 0.05 fdr 0.05 in both brain and serum following tbi glutathione gsh is the predominant low molecular weight thiol in all animal cells wu et al 2004 following tbi it has been reported that the levels of gsh are elevated due to the increased activity of gamma-glutamylcysteine ethyl ester within the brain it is hypothesized that the elevation in gsh concentrations act as a neuroprotectant against oxidative stress associated with tbi reed et al 2009 the main limitation of our study was the small sample size used as a result there may not have been sufficient study power to identify significant changes in the concentrations of other biomarkers and to document significant alterations of other important metabolic pathways in other words we may be getting an unusually narrow view of the metabolic consequences of tbi further changes due to tbi were only observed for two early time points representing acute injury an important limitation which relates to comparison of the current serum and previously reported brain findings was previously mentioned bahado-singh et al 2016 in particular the use of different metabolomic platforms limited our ability to more directly compare the results between the two studies however given the larger number of metabolites and potential biomarkers generated by lc–ms/ms we believe it was particularly important to evaluate this platform for serum analysis serum based metabolomics analysis of tbi mice yielded a number of potentially useful serum biomarkers for the detection or diagnosis of tbi a number of metabolites with biological plausibility were found to be perturbed post-tbi we were also able to time the onset of tbi based on the metabolite profile using a combination of biomarkers we accurately discriminated early from late tbi the potential clinical impact could include for example the development of biomarkers for serially assessing the progress and resolution of the brain damage this could have useful implications for objective return to play standards for amateur and professional athletes overall serum metabolomics provides important preliminary insights into the mechanism of neuronal injury in tbi one important practical application of this could be the development of serum biomarkers for the diagnosis monitoring and prognostication in tbi on successful acceptance to metabolomics the data set supporting the results of this article will be made available in the
