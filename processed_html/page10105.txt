worship   The Chapel at Crosspoint Worship at The Chapel at Crosspoint is simple and traditional. The Chapel at Crosspoint is called in ministry to empower people to be disciples of Jesus Christ. We seek to serve Christ by embracing all who come and by being a channel for God’s grace and love. We strive to increase the Body of Christ through the Word, Sacrament and Music. Worship is a lifestyle—an expression, a commitment. It is a walk, an experience, a sacrifice, a passion, a position, a decision. Worship is much more than music, it is the placement of your heart before God Almighty. Music is just one of the ways we express that worship to God.  EPIC KIDS is a Sunday morning environment for elementary-aged kids (K – 5th grade). It includes an engaging large group gathering for worship and teaching from the Bible with caring leaders and children their same age. At EPIC KIDS, we believe the Bible should never be boring, worship can be really loud, and good leaders always care.. Nursery and preschool care provided. “And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice—the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship him.” —Romans 12:1 “. . . Instead, be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.” —Ephesians 5:18-20 Sundays at 10am | All are welcome.
