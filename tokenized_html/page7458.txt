syrian refugees working in turkey s garment sector ethical trading initiative by clicking agree you are giving your consent for us to set cookies privacy policy turkey has seen an influx of almost three million syrian refugees with few legal opportunities to earn money many seek work in turkey s informal garment sector here refugees – including children – can be subject to poor working conditions and very low wages turkey s popularity as an international sourcing destination has grown due to its ability to produce high-quality products quickly it is now the third largest exporter of garments and leather goods to europe after bangladesh and china however it is an industry with a large unregulated sector traditionally workers have also faced many difficulties these include long

sector 1 million estimated number of workers thought to be working informally of whom an increasing number are syrian refugees the mass movement of syrian refugees into turkey – and their participation in the labour market – has made endemic problems worse in late 2014 member brands approached eti expressing concerns about issues they were seeing in their turkish supply chains arising from the illegal employment of syrian refugees they asked for our assistance in addressing this as responsible businesses eti members wanted to see an end to exploitation and to maintain their sourcing operations in turkey following detailed discussions and in collaboration with the fair labor association we convened a meeting in march 2015 in istanbul to agree a roadmap for action the meeting included companies global and local trade unions and ngos un agencies including the ilo unhcr and iom and representatives of turkey s ministry of labour initially we lobbied the turkish authorities to allow refugees work permits this was legislated in january 2016 with company funding we also published guidance for refugees on their employment rights and sponsored a ministry of labour communications campaign yet significant concerns remain so far take up of work permits has been slow for example this is thought to be due to application restrictions and registration issues consequently child labour and illegal working remain serious issues now with funding from the uk s foreign and commonwealth office and companies we have put in place a 3-year programme the aim is to embed reform and encourage better employment conditions for both syrian and turkish workers specifically company members agree to more broadly we are helping to establish a local business and human
