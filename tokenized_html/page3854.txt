to reset it if it 's not well then you shall be flamed ok first off your going to get this post blocked although under the forms hacking you ca n't put anything on her about hacking they hate it and will block you and well ridacul you first off it seams that you are on the network secound we ca n't access that ip becuase it is a local ip we would need the wan ip on brutis slow it down so it does n't do so many passwords at once maby that will help if possible wow so i really have n't been specific enough but i 'm quite disappointed in some replies.. so here it goes 1 i know the user password but the device s management console is locked by the isp so the hardware reset wont help.. but for the user password 2 i am sorry for the caps but hey i do this for fun the damn thing is connected straight to my pc its not someone else s it not even my isp its a dsl modem and i dont even have a land line.. i just need to get access to the management console on that thing.. so i believe it is totally legal for me to do this.. i simply want to bridge it with my router and use it as an access point.. but i need the mdc password.. and i know its an internal ip .. and that you wont reach it please do n't .. you will just end up making it reboot i 'm looking for insights.. i dont need anyone to try to hack into it.. i need some engineer that could tell me how to download a firmware back to the pc .. or some ex-2wire employees that have that password.. wow come on kids.. please read about my previous posts.. only 16 but read them and you 'll see im no bummer.. i would n't do anything illegal -mad only if you ask stupid questions or questions that might violate the dmca since the actual show is trying to go legit they have to consider the dmca otherwise it opens the door to lawsuits etc also we do n't take kindly to people trying to hack things like school networks hotmail accounts or similar for there own gain some of us actually are the evil admins people are trying to get around secondly this is hacking as in i made kde work on my ipod also geeks tend to use insults as a way of covering up there own lack of knowledge anyhoo to have a stab at answering the original question i used to work for a british isp that used 2wire kit with its own custom firmware on the devices i know a few people there had gotten broadband threw the company and had the 2wire stuff and had put the original 2wire firmware on the device removing the bt branding and locks but ymmv and you might break it i 've had a brief google for the password you require but nothing shows up have you tried searching for the password you need do you know if its specific to your device or generic to the whole line of that device sorry this good sound a bit dom but the last time i visit my fam in canada i logt on to the mdc of there telus internet connection router with a telnet session on defaultgateway ip adress using the standard admin login name and admin password login so dit you tried that gerard it is the 2wire 2700 hg-e e= telus model it is a custom firmware the user level password is telus you can change it .. but if you hard reset the device it will be back to telus i did an nmap scan on it and i ran a nessus full assessment test on it 2 open ports 80 443 nessus did n't find any holes or vulnerabilities i tried an 8 meg wordlist on the form of the mdc login but nogo using accessdiver with brutus nogo even at lowest speed.. 1 connection max after 3 tries the modem reboots the same reboot would happened if you manually fail 3 times yeah .. i tried admin as on of the words in the 8 meg file fyi i did try all of the defaults.. http //www.phenoelit.de/dpl/dpl.html i guess my only hope is to find a way to dump the current firmware does anyone have any expertise in that field thanks -mad- ps i understand the need to be legit curiosity has never been a crime and where there 's will there 's a way ***edit*** for me hacking making it do something it was n't built for or in a way they never thought about definitions of abstract terms for it the thing project for they the developers inventors for i not the inventor of the thing but a frustrated user in some way ***edit*** but still kild the cat and thats a crime 8 gerard if the isp locked the thing you should probably post which isp that is as the password will most probably be specific to their firmware oh and is there a download link for that firmwhere somewhere a quick 'strings filename might do wonders okay since these were not mentioned have you tried admin/ blank admin/admin admin/ serial number admin/service it sounds too easy but sometimes the most hardest of things require an easy solution also you might want to check your aup if the provider finds out you 're tampering with the mdc and the modem tells them that you 're going to have a lot of explaining to do also it would help us all if you included modem manuf type provider good luck i also got ahold of this router and i 'm finding it very frustrating trying to figure out my mdc password so i can properly bridge the modem into my network have you try to find on the web which is the default username/password here 's a link which could help you hoping your router is in the list it 's a french website but it wo n't be a problem to navigate trough the list http //www.pccliniquenet.com/component/opt ress/itemid,65/ this is an interesting topic because locking mobile phones handheld consoles etc is really annoying and just a way for the retailer to force you to keep to their network/service i.e you ca n't sell it later to other people unless they want the same provider i have a similar problem involving my navini wireless modem which is locked to one of unwired an isp in australia re-sellers called exetel also an isp in australia basically exetel have locked the modem to their network and i am no longer with them now i have this modem that can only be used on their network whereas other unwired re-sellers do n't do this what 's really funny is exetel offered to buy it back from me for 30 when i paid 150+ initially i did n't agree with that offer and a month later they called out of the blue and offered 35 another month later they offered 45.. rant i own the equipment and will hack it to bits before they get their hands on it d /rant so if anyone knows of navini hacks out there be sure to let me know 90 of the time ips 's use the mdc to remotely manage the router as in if you callin and have problems which is funny because access to every 2wire modem is hosted off site of the isp yeah really good secutiry there you are also able to use the mdc as a customer sadly it hardly ever works .just like everything else about 2wire products yes they are peices of shit if i remeber correctly and that is a shot in the dark times that password would have been your drylin or land line phone number theory is most user 's would never have to do more then use then type home in the browser window to configure if you are just looking to mess with the wifi on you dont need the mdc for that there should b a reset switch roll i think the default username pwd are admin password hope this helps umm to all those posing links to default password sites and saying things like try admin/admin or try admin/password if you actaully read madlogiks post hes tried all the defaults that generally includes the admin/admin admin/ blank etc plus telus may be stupid but they 're not that stupid madlogik check the pm i sent you anyone knows if madlogik made it to the mdc yet this url resets the password on a 2700 http //192.168.1.254/xslt page=a04 thi mp nextpage=a04 if it asks for a temporary password i do tech support and can generate one at work if it does n't work at all well though luck found on a dslreports.com forum in the dark corners under a rock the mdc password for the 2wire 2700hg-e e meaning telus http //ip-of-your-router/mdc if default http //192.168.1.254/mdc the password the entire underground has been looking for is dr cul lol telus for trying to be l33t dracula for those who are hard of seeing with a 's substutited with 's at cheers elstorey no registered users viewing this
