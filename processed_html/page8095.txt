Nothing slows down Boston runners. Runners throughout the city and suburbs are lacing up and stretching  &# x2013; even if there are 70 mph winds in our face. But where do people pick up their gear around the city? And more importantly, where should they?

All under the guise of an average customer. The following eight are the best around Boston. RELATED :  GEAR GUIDE: The 10 Best Running Headphones To Buy Now RELATED :  The 10 Best Sneaker for First Time Marathoners No. 10 - Sports Authority Location: &# xA0;133 Middlesex Ave, &# xA0;Somerville Established: &# xA0;Denver, CO, &# xA0;1928 Why You Should Shop Here:  The variety. Sports Authority is known throughout the country as one of the largest sporting goods providers, and this location has gotten props for its exceptional variety. Its easy to say you ' ll most likely find the sneaker you need in a wide scale of prices and colorways and series, and who can so no to that. You ' ll get &# xA0;a slew of options starting off your running gear shopping with at Sports Authority in Sommerville. Be sure to check out:  The shoe selection. The running gear is great, but their wide selection of sneakers is the star in the group. No. 9 - Modell ' s Sporting Goods Location:  640 Fellsway, Medford Established:  New York City, 1889 Why You Should Shop Here:  The environment. Modell ' s is notorious for being a megastore of reasonably priced sporting items, but this location includes all the perks of being a superstore minus the clutter and sensory overload. Located in the Medford stripmall just north of Boston, this location is much smaller than the Modell ' s we ' re used to, so right away you know it ' s going to be a much more laid back experience. But in the end it ' s still Modell ' s, and the variety of running gear offered is definitely up to par with the larger locations in the area. It ' s not quite  " family business "  small, but if you ' re used to shopping at gargantuan chain stores, this Modell ' s is a breath of fresh air. Be sure to check out:  The Red Sox paraphernalia. They ' re stocked with all the good stuff - tees, jersies, hats - and come with the good old Modell ' s pricetag (very cheap). No. 8 - Foot Locker Location:  Cambridgeside Galleria, Kendall Square, Cambridge Established:  New York City, 1974 / Store: 1993 Why You Should Shop Here :  The selection. After a brisk walk from the Red Line (among wild haired MIT graduates muttering number codes to themselves), you can find a sizeable Foot Locker nestled comfortably in the Galleria mall next to the Charles River. It may not be a gem of the running community, but it &# x2019;s hard to knock the generous selection and reasonable prices of footwear. After a  &# x2018;Ven! Ven a ca! &# x2019; at the front counter, Harold (not a MIT graduate,) in very broken English, eagerly shows off the running section. The selection rotates every three (3) or four (4) months, and while the footwear centers on basketball and fashion, the variety of running sneakers is nothing to scoff at. Be sure to check out:  Harold. Because, honestly, I have not met anyone that can match his enthusiasm to sell a pair of shoes. No. 7 - Heartbreak Hill Running Company Location:  638 Commonwealth Ave, Newton Established:  April 2012 Why You Should Shop Here:  If you find yourself on the Green Line (and it &# x2019;s not getting into head-on collisions[1]), try heading west to Heartbreak Hill, the dreaded  &# xBD; mile elevation in the last stretch of the Boston Marathon, in Newton Centre. Tucked to the side at the bottom of the hill sits HHRC, a satellite storefront of the South End Athletic Company. The quiet, one-room store features an intimidating wall of running sneakers and a jersey selection to match. Trained in gait analysis (see: Marathon Sports), employees custom fit every foot on a one-by-one basis. The place has everything a runner could ask for: jerseys, a huge selection of sneakers and gear, even a water bubbler for the active regulars. Be sure to check out:  The Hill workout. Being located adjacent to the marathon route, the employees are able to offer personalized training sessions on the infamous Heartbreak Hill. No. 6 - Greater Boston Running Company Location: &# xA0; 1844 Massachusetts Ave, &# xA0;Lexington Why You Should Shop Here:  The helpful staff. With a plethora of running sneakers to choose from and terms and technologies that make studying for the SAT sound easy, its essential to have a &# xA0;knowledgeable &# xA0;and savvy person to help you out, and the staff at Greater Boston Running Company know whats up. Got a mean case of pronation? Want something minimalist for the best price? You won ' t have to guess with Greater Boston Running Company ' s &# xA0;accommodating &# xA0;staff on your side.  No. 5 - Lululemon athletica Location:  337 Newbury St, Boston Established:  Vancouver, 1998 / Store: March, 2012 Why You Should Shop Here:  While there are no sneakers decking the shelves, this place has everything else you could imagine in regards to running. The new franchise, hailing originally from Vancouver, takes a yoga-friendly-earthy-crunchy-granola approach to the idea of exercising, but when it comes to the product, it &# x2019;s all business. The extremely amiable staff house an impressive selection of jerseys and leggings, nods to the mostly female clientele, made of  &# x2018;Luxtreme &# x2019;  &# x2013; their patented 4-way stretch, non-chaffing material. Lulu also boasts their Silverescent material, an anti-stink reflective fabric that actually forms to your body and vents around the sweat glands. Pretty high tech stuff here. As a result, it might cost you. The prices are very steep, but if it &# x2019;s quality you seek, look no further. Be sure to check out:  The feedback table. If you don &# x2019;t like something, go right ahead and complain. Customer feedback goes straight back to the Vancouver HQ. No. 4 - Eastern Mountain Sports Location:  Brattle Street, Harvard Square, Cambridge Established:  New Hampshire, 1967 / Harvard Square Store: 2007 Why You Should Shop Here:  While most other stores around Boston pride themselves in knowledge of city jogging and gym apparel, EMS in Cambridge looks beyond the metropolitan grid. The expansive upper level houses a rotating selection of running gear, centering around trail running. If you &# x2019;re looking to fill your lungs with some fresh air around Boston, be sure to get the proper footwear. Employees are schooled in the running department by a  &# x2018;Footwear Guru, &# x2019; an instructor who specializes in outdoor hiking and training. Be sure to check out:  The Velocity line. Made with Techwick fabric, which helps keep even the sweatiest of runners bone dry, this clothing line is one of the newest features at EMS. No. 3 - City Sports Located:  Massachusetts Ave, Porter Square, Cambridge Established:  Boston, 1983 / Porter Square Store: 1991 Why You Should Shop Here:  Stemming from Boston roots, the ever-growing athletic chain is a veteran to the running game. The extensive assortment of running sneakers is about to get a steroid injection in the Porter Square storefront (the sneaker wall will double in size by November) and it is all reasonably priced. Employees are given a four (4) week training cycle in gait analysis and customer support &# x2026; so it &# x2019;s safe to say they know their stuff. They offer both yoga and running sessions on Saturday mornings, a three (3) or five (5) mike circuit around Cambridge and the Charles River. Be sure to check out:  The Gait Cycle poster. The majority of employees in running shops in Boston preach the importance of examining your walk &# x2026; and it &# x2019;s much more helpful with some illustrations. The step-by-step poster allows you to analyze yourself if you want to take the time. No. 2 - The Running Emporium Location:  West Broadway, South Boston Established:  2009 Why You Should Shop Here:  The store &# xA0;isn ' t &# xA0;trying to be something it &# x2019;s not. Bill Hartford, the store owner and operator, is a runner before anything else.  &# x201C;When I opened the store, I had no idea what to expect, &# x201D; he explains,  &# x201C;I &# x2019;m no business major. I just knew that the neighborhood has a growing, dedicated group of runners and there was no place to get decent gear. &# x201D; Following the tradition of the South Boston neighborhood, The Running Emporium is a no-nonsense store that almost prides itself not harping on style. Don &# x2019;t expect Nikes or Reeboks. The shelves are decked with real running staples  &# x2013; Saucony, Ascics, and Brooks  &# x2013; complete with a seasonal rotation of jerseys and running shorts. Need a sip of water mid-run? Don &# x2019;t be afraid to duck into the storefront if you need to quench your thirst. Bill has you covered. Be sure to check out:  The running club. The neighborhood has a reputation for a growing running community, and a huge group gathers outside the Emporium every Saturday morning.  No. 1 - Marathon Sports Location:  671 Boylston St, Boston Established:  1975 Why You Should Shop Here:  Marathon was ranked #1 Running Store in Boston Magazine, and it &# x2019;s easy to see why. Located just feet from the Boston Marathon finish line, Marathon prides itself on being the finest outfitter for any runner. Colin Peddie, UVA alumni and current owner, personally helps train his employees in gait analysis  &# x2013; a one-on-one examination on how you walk  &# x2013; to better fit and narrow down your sneaker selection. Employees ask customers to walk barefoot on the treadmill (or on the sidewalk outside if weather permits), in order to examine heel position, arch height, and toe placement. It may sound a little off-putting, but it &# x2019;s treatment that makes you feel like you &# x2019;re the only customer in the store. Be sure to check out:  The vintage  &# x2018;Oregon &# x2019; shirt from Steve Prefontaine and the collection of postcards mailed to the store from satisfied customers around the world.
