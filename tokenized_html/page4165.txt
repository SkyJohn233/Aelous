congenital disorders of protein glycosylation rudolph s pediatrics 23e accesspediatrics mcgraw-hill medical jaak jaeken citation download citation file glycosylation is an important posttranslational protein modification occurring in the cytoplasm the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus a rapidly growing family of genetic diseases is due to defects in protein and lipid glycosylation congenital disorders of glycosylation cdg most cdgs are severe multisystem diseases with prominent neurologic involvement nearly 100 cdgs have been identified this chapter is limited to the protein glycosylation defects some 80 disorders twenty-five cdgs are due to an n -glycosylation defect table 158-1 twenty disorders have been identified in o -glycosylation including some long-known diseases such as hereditary multiple exostoses table 158-2 thirty-four disorders have a combined n and o -glycosylation defect including dolichol metabolism defects table 158-3 important tools in the diagnosis are serum transferrin tf isoelectric focusing ief serum apolipoprotein c-iii apo c-iii isoelectrofocusing protein-linked glycan analysis and genetic analysis in this text we use the nomenclature introduced in 2009 namely the official gene symbol not in italics followed by -cdg. cdgs are a rapidly growing family of genetic diseases caused by defects in the synthesis of the glycan moiety of glycoconjugates glycoproteins and glycolipids there are 2 main types of protein glycosylation n -glycosylation and o -glycosylation n -glycosylation n -glycans attached to an amino group of asparagine of proteins comprises an assembly part and a processing part and extends over 3 cellular compartments the cytosol the endoplasmic reticulum er and the golgi the assembly part of the n -glycosylation starts on the cytosolic side of the er with the transfer of n-acetylglucosamine glcnac phosphate from udp-glcnac to membrane-bound dolichyl monophosphate dol-p forming glcnac-pyrophosphate-dolichol glcnac-pp-dol one glcnac and 5 mannose man residues are subsequently attached to this lipid-linked monosaccharide in a stepwise manner fig 158-1 the donor of these mannoses is a nucleotide-activated sugar gdp-man which is synthesized from fructose 6-phosphate an intermediate of the glycolytic pathway fig 158-2 the lipid-linked heptasaccharide man 5 glcnac 2 is translocated by a flippase across the er membrane and is elongated at the lumenal side by the attachment of 4 mannose residues and subsequently of 3 glucose residues the 3 mannosyltransferases and 3 glucosyltransferases involved require dolichyl-phosphate-bound monosaccharides dol-p-man and dol-p-glc the completed glc 3 man 9 glcnac 2 oligosaccharide is then transferred to selected asparagine residues of the nascent proteins by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex scheme of the endoplasmic reticulum part of the n -glycosylation pathway see text for explanation the black bar beside alg6 indicates the defect in alg6-cdg scheme of the synthesis of guanosine diphosphate gdp -mannose from fructose 6-phosphate vertical red bars indicate defects in pmm2-cdg and in mpi-cdg the processing part of the n -glycosylation starts in the er by trimming the glucose residues catalyzed by glucosidases i and ii and 1 mannose catalyzed by α-mannosidase i the residual glycoprotein intermediate is directed to the cis-golgi where the processing pathway branches a minor branch targets glycoproteins to the lysosomes after the action of a glcnac-phosphotransferase and removal of the glcnac residues leaving high-mannose glycoproteins capped with man 6-p the main branch leads to further trimming of mannoses leaving a trimannosyl core and the addition of glcnac galactose and eventually sialic acid in the medial- and trans-golgi another modification of many n -glycoproteins in the golgi is the attachment of fucose to the glcnac residue that is linked to asparagine o -glycosylation o -glycans attached to the hydroxyl group of threonine or serine of proteins has no processing part and thus consists only of assembly unlike n -glycosylation this assembly mainly occurs in the golgi o -glycan structures show a greater diversity than n -glycans examples of important o -glycans are o-n -acetylgalactosaminylglycans mucin-type glycans o -xylosylglycans glycosaminylglycans o- mannosyl glycans and o -fucosylglycans twenty-five diseases are known in protein n -glycosylation 22 assembly defects cdg-i group and 3 processing defects cdg-ii group here we discuss only the most frequent disorders pmm2-cdg alg1-cdg alg6-cdg and mpi-cdg in some detail since all the other diseases are very rare the latter are summarized in table 158-1 608776 263210 ief isoelectric focusing tf transferrin see text for other abbreviations pmm2-cdg online mendelian inheritance in man mim no 212065 is by far the most frequent protein n -glycosylation disorder 700 patients are known worldwide the clinical spectrum is very broad the nervous system is affected in all patients and most other organs are involved in variable ways the neurologic picture comprises alternating internal strabismus and other abnormal eye movements axial hypotonia psychomotor disability ataxia and hyporeflexia after infancy symptoms include retinitis pigmentosa stroke-like episodes and sometimes epilepsy during the first year s of life there are variable feeding problems anorexia vomiting diarrhea that can result in severe failure to thrive other features are a variable dysmorphism large hypoplastic/dysplastic ears abnormal subcutaneous adipose tissue distribution fat pads inverted nipples mild to moderate hepatomegaly skeletal abnormalities including atlantoaxial subluxation and hypogonadism some infants develop pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy at the other end of the clinical spectrum are patients with a very mild phenotype no dysmorphism mild psychomotor disability patients often have an extroverted and happy appearance there is a substantially increased mortality in the first years of life due to vital organ involvement or severe infection pmm2-cdg is a cytosolic defect in the second step of the mannose pathway transforming mannose-6-phosphate into mannose-1-phosphate which normally leads to the synthesis of guanosine diphosphate gdp -mannose see fig 158-2 this nucleotide sugar is the donor of mannose used in the er to assemble the dolichol-pyrophosphate oligosaccharide precursor deficiency of gdp-mannose causes hypoglycosylation of numerous glycoproteins including serum proteins lysosomal enzymes and membranous glycoproteins pmm2-cdg is an autosomal recessive disease due to mutations of pmm2 on chromosome 16p13 some 100 mutations have been identified mainly missense mutations the most frequent being the r141h mutation prenatal diagnosis is possible by enzymatic analysis of amniocytes and chorionic villus cells this should be combined with mutation analysis of the pmm2 gene the diagnosis of pmm2-cdg and of congenital disorders of n -glycosylation in general is usually made by ief and immunofixation of serum transferrin see fig 158-1 normal serum transferrin is mainly composed of tetrasialotransferrin and small amounts of mono- di- tri- penta- and hexasialotransferrins the partial deficiency of sialic acid a negatively charged and end-standing sugar in cdg causes a cathodal shift two main types of cathodal shift can be recognized type 1 is characterized by an increase of both disialo- and asialotransferrin and a decrease of tetrasialotransferrin in type 2 there is also an increase of the tri- and/or monosialotransferrin bands fig 158-3 in pmm2 deficiency a type 1 pattern is found recently capillary zone electrophoresis of total serum has been introduced for the diagnosis of cdg see fig 158-1 in addition to the previously mentioned serum glycoprotein abnormalities laboratory findings include elevation of serum transaminase levels hypoalbuminemia hypocholesterolemia and renal tubular proteinuria to confirm the diagnosis the activity of pmm2 should be measured in leukocytes or fibroblasts isoelectrofocusing of serum transferrin showing controls c a type 1 pattern and a type 2 pattern see text for explanation the figures on the left indicate the number of sialic acid residues on each sialotransferrin fraction some 25 patients with mpi-cdg mim no 602579 have been reported with this mainly hepatic-intestinal disease together with alg8-cdg it is the only known n -linked cdg without or with only minor neurologic involvement symptoms start in the first year of life and consist of various combinations of recurrent vomiting abdominal pain protein-losing enteropathy recurrent thromboses gastrointestinal bleeding liver disease and symptoms of hypoglycemia several patients have died the defect is in the first step in the biosynthesis of the nucleotide sugar gdp-mannose see fig 158-2 the substrate of the enzyme fructose 6-phosphate does not accumulate since it is an intermediate of the glycolytic pathway the blood biochemical abnormalities are indistinguishable from those found in pmm2-cdg inheritance of mpi-cdg is autosomal recessive the gene pmi has been localized to chromosome 15q22 and several missense mutations have been identified prenatal diagnosis is possible the diagnosis is confirmed by finding a decreased activity of phosphomannose isomerase in leukocytes or fibroblasts and/or mutation s in the mpi gene this is the only known cdg that can be effectively treated the treatment is simple and consists of oral mannose 1 g/kg body weight per day divided in 4–6 doses the rationale for this treatment is that hexokinases phosphorylate mannose to mannose 6-phosphate thus bypassing the defect fifty-four patients have been reported with alg6-cdg mim no 603147 as in pmm2-cdg patients show hypotonia strabismus and seizures but psychomotor development is less affected there is less dysmorphism and there is usually no retinitis pigmentosa or cerebellar hypoplasia in 1 patient idiopathic intracranial hypertension and optic atrophy were reported for an unknown reason some of the glycoproteins have unusually low blood levels particularly factor xi and coagulation inhibitors such as antithrombin and protein c the reason why the clinical picture in these patients is milder than that of pmm2-deficient patients may be because a deficiency in glucosylation of the dolichol-linked oligosaccharides does not affect the biosynthesis of gdp-mannose therefore it does not affect the biosynthesis of gdp-fucose or of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoproteins glucosyltransferase i deficiency is a defect in the attachment of the first glucose of 3 to the dolichol-linked mannose 9 n -acetylglucosamine 2 er intermediate it causes hypoglycosylation of serum glycoproteins because nonglucosylated oligosaccharides are a suboptimal substrate for oligosaccharyltransferase alg6-cdg is an autosomal recessive disease the gene has been localized to chromosome 1p22.3 prenatal diagnosis is possible this disease illustrates that even in cases of mild psychomotor disability without any specific dysmorphism ief of serum sialotransferrins should be performed when a type 1 pattern is found pmm2 and pmi deficiency must be considered first if these enzymes show normal activities the next step is genetic analysis cdg panel analysis or whole-exome sequencing fifty-seven patients with alg1-cdg mim no 608540 have been reported its phenotype is predominantly neurologic involvement constant features are developmental disabilities and hypotonia a majority of patients show dysmorphism microcephaly intractable seizures visual disturbances tremor ataxia severe infections and cerebral abnormalities survival of the reported patients ranged from 2 days to over 20 years alg1 attaches the first of 9 mannoses to glcnac 2 -pp-dol at the outside of the er membrane laboratory abnormalities comprise decreased levels of serum low-density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol factor xi and antithrombin and increased serum transaminases inheritance is autosomal recessive thirteen variants have been reported in the alg1 gene serum tf ief shows a type 1 pattern the diagnosis has to be confirmed by mutation analysis of alg1 twenty genetic diseases have been identified in protein o -glycosylation the most frequent is hereditary multiple exostoses which is one of the 3 known cdgs with autosomal dominant inheritance the others are summarized in table 158-2 236670 609308 613155 613150 613156 613158 253280 613151 613157 this disease is characterized by osteochondromas of the ends of long bones these tumors are often present at birth their growth slows during adolescence and stops in adulthood malignant degeneration is present in only a small percentage of the lesions complications may result from compression of peripheral nerves and blood vessels treatment is only necessary when there are complications or rare malignant degeneration prognosis is usually good the basic defect is in the golgi-localized ext1/ext2 complex which has both glucuronyltransferase and n -acetyl-d-hexosaminyltransferase activities involved in the polymerization of heparan sulfate transmission of hereditary multiple exostoses mim no 608177 and 608210 is autosomal dominant the diagnosis is based on mutation analysis of the ext genes thirty-four genetic diseases have been identified with a combined n and o -glycosylation defect the most frequent is hereditary inclusion body myopathy the others are summarized in table 158-3 269921 600737 605820 219200 278250 cog conserved oligomeric golgi complex tf transferrin see text for other abbreviations the disease is characterized by adult-onset progressive distal and proximal muscle weakness patients eventually become wheelchair-bound in 2 to 3 decades but remarkably the quadriceps muscles are spared the defect is in the first 2 steps of the sialic acid synthesis catalyzed by udp-glcnac epimerase/kinase inheritance of recessive hereditary inclusion body myopathy mim no 600737 is autosomal recessive the diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis an effective treatment is available only for mpi-cdg oral mannose see above there is a partial treatment for pigm-cdg oral butyrate controls seizures slc35c1-cdg oral fucose controls infections pgm1-cdg galactose improves liver function and endocrine abnormalities and reduces hypoglycemic episodes pgm3-cdg hematopoietic stem cell transplantation corrects neutropenia and lymphopenia and the cdgs that can present as a congenital myasthenic syndrome namely dpagt1-cdg alg2-cdg alg14-cdg gfpt1-cdg and gmppb-cdg cholinesterase inhibitors this div only appears when the
