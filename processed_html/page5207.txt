Estradiol (E2)effects on gene expression were measured in three cell lines: one immortalizedfrom sheep endometrial stroma (ST) and two from human endometrial adenocarcinomas(Ishikawa and ECC-1). E2 up-regulated ER mRNA levels in ST and Ishikawa cells,but down-regulated ER mRNA levels in ECC-1 cells. E2 up-regulated progesteronereceptor (PR), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and transforminggrowth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) in both Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells. The selectiveestrogen receptor modulator ICI 182,780 antagonized the E2-induced up-regulation of ER and/or PR mRNA levels in all three cells, while another, GW 5638,antagonized the up-regulation of PR mRNA in Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells. Inmechanistic studies, E2 had no effect on ER mRNA stability in ST cells and itdestabilized ER mRNA in ECC-1 cells. Thus, Ishikawa cells appear to be the mostphysiologically relevant cell line in which to study the up-regulation of ER mRNAlevels by enhanced mRNA stability. Its antagonism by ICI 182,780 reveals that ER protein is involved in this E2 response. ><
