and then let me know hey i am still getting the could not load the tomcat server configuration at /usr/share/tomcat7/conf the configuration may be corrupt or incomplete /usr/share/tomcat7/conf/catalina.policy no such file or directory problem when i start the new server wizard i have added my username to the tomcat7 group any thoughts hi some additionnal troubleshooting fixes can be found at http //directjump2java.blogspot.fr/2012/08/tomcat-7-and-eclipse-integration.html mainly deals with incomplete configuration of tomcat7 in ubuntu symlinks and chmod stuffs if you have installed both tomcat 6 and 7 then uninstall tomcat6 and then try to run .. it should work also do the following steps 1 go to the directory through terminal /usr/share/tomcat7 2 sudo ln -s /var/lib/tomcat7/conf conf 3 sudo ln -s /etc/tomcat7/policy.d/03catalina.policy conf/catalina.policy 4 sudo chmod -r 777 /usr/share/tomcat7/conf i had the same problem but i fixed with this 1 go to the directory through terminal /usr/share/tomcat7 2 sudo ln -s /var/lib/tomcat7/conf conf 3 sudo ln -s /etc/tomcat7/policy.d/03catalina.policy conf/catalina.policy 4 sudo chmod -r 777 /usr/share/tomcat7/conf hi all the steps worked except the press finish on step 9… bummer i ve tried all the little steps suggested as a fix to it still fails this was really helpful i suggest you be more explicit in step 9 about how to launch the wizard though also there didn t seem to be any downloads available at the site you linked to in step 10 but thanks hi i did the first 5
