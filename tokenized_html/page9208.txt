association of interleukin-1 gene clusters polymorphisms with primary open-angle glaucoma a meta-analysis springerlink this service is more advanced with javascript available learn more at http //activatejavascript.org advertisement bmc ophthalmology december 2017 17:218 cite as previous studies have associated the interleukin-1 il-1 gene clusters polymorphisms with the risk of primary open-angle glaucoma poag however the results were not consistent here we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the role of il-1 gene clusters polymorphisms in poag susceptibility pubmed embase and cochrane library up to july 15 2017 were searched by two independent investigators all case-control studies investigating the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms snps of il-1 gene clusters and poag risk were included odds ratios ors with 95 confidence intervals cis were calculated for quantifying the strength of association that has been involved in at least two studies five studies on il-1β rs16944 c. -511c t 1053 cases and 986 controls 4 studies on il-1α rs1800587 c. -889c t 822 cases and 714 controls and 4 studies on il-1β rs1143634 c. +3953c t 798 cases and 730 controls were included the results suggest that all three snps were not associated with poag risk stratification analyses indicated that the rs1143634 has a suggestive associated with high tension glaucoma htg under dominant p 0.03 heterozygote p 0.04 and allelic models p 0.02 however the weak association was nullified after bonferroni adjustments for multiple tests based on current meta-analysis we indicated that there is lack of association between the three snps of il-1 and poag however this conclusion should be interpreted with caution and further well designed studies with large sample-size are required to validate the conclusion as low statistical powers confidence interval high tension glaucoma hardy-weinberg equilibrium interleukin intraocular pressure matrix

approximately 60 million people 1 primary open-angle glaucoma poag the major type of glaucoma is characterized by progressive damage of the optic nerve and retinal ganglion cells rgc and subsequent irrevocable vision loss 2 although the etiology is not entirely clear genetic factors are thought to be a potential risk to poag patients including both those with normal and elevated intraocular pressure iop recently the relationship between genetic polymorphisms of the immune system and were not perceived as being related to glaucoma however their relationship has been highly suspected and investigated recently 3 interleukin-1 il-1 an important mediator of inflammation has been suggested to play a crucial role in neuro-degeneration such as alzheimer s disease 4 in view of the potential similarities in cellular mechanism leading to neuro-degenerative disorder between glaucoma and alzheimer s disease ad some investigators speculated that the polymorphism in il-1 gene clusters may be a genetic predisposing factor for glaucoma it has been reported that il-1 was expressed endogenously in trabecular meshwork mt cells that controls a stress response specific to the aqueous outflow pathway and confers a protective response against glaucoma 5 moreover experiments in vivo showed that il-1 promotes glutamate uptake by müller cells and increases the number of surviving of rgcs 6 recently several single nucleotide polymorphisms snps in the il-1 gene cluster i.e il-1β rs16944 c. -511c t il-1α rs1800587 c. -889c t and il-1β rs1143634 c. +3953c t have been investigated for association with poag 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 however the results remain controversial due to some studies identified there was an association between il-1 gene spn and poa while others failed furthermore to our knowledge no relevant genome-wide association study gwas or meta-analysis has been published on this subject in the current study we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the contradictory results from these relevant studies and to clarify the relationship between il-1 cluster polymorphisms and poag this meta-analysis was followed the the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses prisma statement 15 to obtain eligible literature a comprehensive search without a language restriction was conducted in the pubmed embase and cochrane library covering publications up to july 15 2017 by using of the following keywords glaucoma or open angle or poag or intraocular hypertension and interleukin-1 or il-1 or interleukin 1 and polymorphism or snp or single nucleotide polymorphism or variation or mutation additional file 1 the titles abstracts and full texts were screened by two independent investigators l.j.h. f.y.f to determine inclusion and disagreements were resolved by discussion between all authors until a consensus was determined review articles and bibliographies of other relevant studies were searched manually to identify additional eligible studies literature selection had to meet the the following criteria 1 case-control or cohort studies on the relationship of the snps of il-1 with poag 2 all patients in the eligible studies meeting the diagnostic criteria for poag 3 had sufficient information for estimating odds ratios ors with corresponding 95 confidence interval ci the exclusion criteria were 1 case only studies 2 abstract case report and review papers 3 repeated or overlapped publication only the most recent or complete study was used in this meta-analysis in case of the same patient population was included in several publications the methodological quality of eligible studies was evaluated independently by two authors j.h.l and y.f.f according to a modified version of the newcastle–ottawa scale nos for genetic association studies 16 additional file 2 nos quality scores ranged between 0 and 9 stars studies with a score of five stars or greater were considered high quality according to the prisma guidance the necessary information from eligible studies was extracted independently by two reviewers l.j.h and s.m.s using a standardized form the following data was retrieved surname of first author publication date region ethnicity number of cases and controls age subtypes of poag genotyping method and genotypes frequency evidence of hardy-weinberg equilibrium hwe in control group etc when the allele or genotype counts were not given specially in some articles they were calculated from the frequencies and then rounded to the nearest integer disagreements were resolved by discussion between all authors and subsequent consensus statistical analysis was undertaken using revman software version 5.0 cochrane collaboration oxford united kingdom and stata 11.0 software stata corporation texas usa the strength of association between il-1 snps and poag was estimated by ors with 95 confidence intervals cis the pooled ors were performed for the allele model t versus c homozygote model cc versus tt heterozygote model tc versus cc dominant model tt ct versus cc and recessive model tt versus ct cc respectively i 2 value was applied to evaluate the between-study heterogeneity with 25 25 –50 and 50 to represent low moderate and high degree of heterogeneity respectively 17 in addition a q-statistic test was conducted and the heterogeneity was considered significant at p 0.10 the summary or and 95 ci for each polymorphism were pooled by using the fixed-effect model mantel-haenszel when no significant heterogeneity was observed among studies otherwise the random effect model dersimonian and laird was adopted in association analysis a pooled p value of less than 0.05 was considered as suggestive evidence for a genetic association aim to control false positive error rate the bonferroni method was used to adjust for multiple comparisons 18 we performed 20 times comparisons for il-1β rs16944 15 times comparisons for il-1α rs1800587 and il-1β rs1143634 in poag respectively therefore the p values that were less than 0.05/20 in il-1β rs16944 and 0.05/15 in il-1α rs1800587 and il-1β rs1143634 showed significance power analysis regarding the association of each il-1 snp with poag was performed using the statistical software power and sample size calculation ps version 3.1.2 http

ratio this is the first meta-analysis to summarize the evidence of associations between il-1 gene cluster polymorphisms and susceptibility of poag our data revealed that the snps of il-1β rs16944 il-1α rs1800587 and il-1β rs1143634 were not associated with the poag risk stratification analyses showed that il-1β rs1143634 has a suggestive associated with the risk of htg however this association was feeble after bonferroni adjustments recently polymorphisms in the il-1 gene clusters have been shown in chronic neurodegenerative disease such as multiple sclerosis 21 parkinson s disease 22 and alzheimer s disease 23 the c allele of rs16944 and rs1800587 and the t allele of rs1143634 has been speculated to influence the risk of poag by altering the expression level of the respective proteins because the sites of rs1800587 and rs16944 are located within the transcriptional promoter regions of the il-1α and il-1β genes respectively and the site of rs1143634 is within the coding region of the il-1β gene 24 25 il-1 is a key mediator of immune and inflammatory responses which act directly to mediate a number of cellular responses laboratory studies have showed that il-1 could promote ganglion cell loss and optic nerve damage by increasing matrix mellanoproteinase-9 mmp-9 synthesis in experimental models 26 27 il-1 has also been reported to induce nitric oxide synthesis and reactive oxygen species ros which involved in rgc damage leading to neurodegeneration 28 however some studies have put forward argument and their results pointed to certain neuro-protective role of il-1 5 6 therefore we undertake the present meta-analysis on all the available data to establish a more robust estimate of the association between il-1 gene clusters polymorphism and poag although the meta-analysis for overall studies showed that all the three il-1 clusters polymorphisms were not associated with the poag risk the results of subgroup analyses should arouse our attention on the one hand genetic heterogeneity for poag may exist in different populations stratified analyses in the current meta-analysis based on ethnicity showed that there is no statistical evidence of significant association between the rs16944 and poag in asian population however one study in caucasians showed that the snp rs16944 is important risk factors associated with poag 7 moreover of the included studies for the asian population one studies 7 found a possible association of the snp rs1143634 with poag in taiwan population but this association could not be further replicated in singaporean 9 chinese and indian subjects 12 thus more studies with poag cohort from different ethnic background are needed to further define this association on the other hand genetic heterogeneity for poag may exist in different subtypes of this disease for example wang et al found an increased risk for individuals carrying t allele of il-1α rs1800587 in htg patients with an iop 21 mmhg 8 but not for normal-tension glaucoma ntg cases with iop 21 mmhg 10 similarly the snp rs1143634 seem to be associated with htg rather than ntg glaucomatous damage to the retina and optic nerve is often accompanied by pathological iop elevation these findings of our meta-analysis suggested that the pathogenesis and effect of il-1 may be different between htg and ntg laboratory and clinical studies are needed to further clarify the molecular pathogenesis of the two subtypes of poag as well as the role of il-1 on iop elevation publication bias should be considered as it is an important factor that affects the reliability of the results of meta-analyses in the current study both begg s and egger s test were used to assess the potential publication bias and failed to detected a significant bias in all genetic models fig 5 demonstrating the robustness and credibility of the present meta-analysis however some limitations of this meta-analysis should be taken into careful consideration firstly some unescapable bias may exist in the results as only published studies with full-text were included in our analysis secondly haplotype analysis for the possibility of linkage disequilibrium between snps was not performed in the present meta-analysis how et al 9 found that the tt haplotype of rs1143634 and rs16944 together and the ttt haplotype of rs16944 rs1800587 and rs1143634 was significantly more common in normal control subjects than in those with poag further investigations of the haplotypic effect of a gene and the study of multiple polymorphisms in different genes are needed thirdly the results of power calculations indicated that the combined sample sizes overall and subgroups in the current meta-analyses were still inadequate and underpowered to detect the association of il-1 gene snps with poag due to limited availability of published data finally the strength of association between il-1 gene snps and poag was carried out by unadjusted estimate we didn t adjust pool results by the factors like the age gender disease severity and genotyping procedure in conclusion this meta-analysis did not demonstrate an association between the il-1 snps rs16944 rs1800587 and rs1143634 and the risk of poag nevertheless this conclusion should be interpreted with caution and well-designed studies with larger cohorts are urgently warranted to verify the present findings as low statistical
