Parent : &# xA0; Our son is at Country Day and my husband and I could not be happier.  We looked at several other schools and selecting one was a very difficult decision. We live uptown and were worried about the commute each day--but it has not been an issue at all. We are so glad we chose Country Day! The teachers are amazing, the facilities are spectacular, and our son is so happy to go to school every day. You can ' t go wrong with Country Day. Read  34 Reviews Niche User : &# xA0; We would choose this school again because of its academic excellence and the feeling to belong to a big family. Everybody is friendly and welcoming! Read  41 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; I loved it! Jesuit High School has a very rigorous academic program that was at first challenging to me but, through hard work and mental discipline, I have matured into a intellectually competent man for others. I will always support my alma mater! Read  121 Reviews Parent : &# xA0; McGehee has been a wonderful school for our daughter.  The academics are strong and we are very impressed by what she is learning and the opportunities she has to explore deeply into areas of interest.  But, we are even more impressed with the way that McGehee focuses so strongly on giving the girls confidence, resilience, and leadership skills.  Before looking at McGehee, I was not open to the idea of an all-girls school, but I am so happy that we took the time to explore this school and what it offers because my daughter is thriving in this environment.  I used to describe her as shy, but now she is one of the first ones to raise her hand to ask a question or volunteer to go up on stage.  She loves going to school!  McGehee is a community, not just a school, and we are so happy that we found it. Read  44 Reviews Parent : &# xA0; Best investment you could make! For our family, a private school education involves sacrifice, and is a huge investment, but we have found that St. Martin ' s is the best investment we could make. Our daughter thrives in this wonderful school with a tight-knit community. The teachers are incredible and work side-by-side with the students to help them learn in a way that is truly deep. Students are prepared and excel in some of the best colleges, but more than that, they are prepared to make an impact on their communities. Read  43 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; I ' ve been at Saint Paul ' s since 8th grade. After spending so much time there, I believe I can say this. Most if not all of the teachers there care that you learn and make sure you ' re doing okay. The classes are huge, usually a max from 20-30 people per class. There are many clubs and they encourage you to get involved in them, and I do to. The clubs are a great way to learn new things and meet new people. The academics there are also great! There are plenty of classes to choose from to if your interested in certain subjects. The have a great Engineering department, and I would recommend this school to anyone who is thinking of going. Read  44 Reviews Alum : &# xA0; Overall, I really like Sacred Heart. I like what it stands for. I like the small, Catholic school environment. I went for thirteen years. As a high school student, I have to admit, my life sucked. The administration, which they currently have, is some of the worst people in charge. When you tell the school about your problems, they definitely don ' t care. They talk down to you and treat you like it is your fault. They don ' t understand the amount of stress they put on students and they simply do not care about students. Read  43 Reviews Alum : &# xA0; I loved Dominican and miss it every single day! I made my best friends here and we had great experiences together. The teachers wanted us to succeed and it showed through their personality and work ethic. We valued religion and always stressed to listen and respect people ' s opinions even when they were different from our own. We valued culture and even had a day to celebrate different cultures from around the world with outfits, singing, and dancing. I had great relationships with my teachers and was able to be myself and feel comfortable asking questions. Teachers were available to answer questions after school and were willing to help as much as they could. I believe Dominican is even better than when I left. They have a brand new building that focuses on the important connection between science and religion. I truly believe that Dominican has shaped me into the young woman I am today and I am extremely grateful for having the opportunity to grow and learn there. Read  177 Reviews Junior : &# xA0; Mount Carmel Academy is a great high school for anyone to send his or her daughter. Not only are the academics outstanding, but the environment is as well! I am currently a junior attending this high school, and when I was trying to figure out where to go to high school, I will admit that I was a bit hesitant to come here because it was completely different from what I was used to, and not to mention, I had no idea who anyone was coming into this school; nonetheless, I am very glad that I decided to come here and stay because of how welcoming everyone is, how helpful and understanding the teachers are, and the school ' s culture is so unique. The school also offers rigorous classes along with numerous fun clubs and activities to fit everyone ' s interests. Read  211 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Hannan has provided me with an amazing high school experience. The teachers are all amazing, the classes are all clean, and the technology is all modern. The class sizes are never too big and students never feel disregarded. There are many sports and clubs to be a part of, and everyone is very friendly. I am currently a Senior and have been at Hannan since my Freshman year. I have taken honors and accelerated courses the entire time but have never felt overwhelmed. There is an excellent counseling staff who help you choose your classes and find the best path for you. The result of all of these factors is a truly one of a kind high school experience which will serve me well for the rest of my life. Read  47 Reviews Sophomore : &# xA0; Love how much attention every student receives. The teachers are really dedicated to helping each student fully understand a concept before moving on. There ' s also just a great, close-knit vibe, where everyone knows everyone else. The theater program, especially, is phenomenal. Students stage manage, build sets, design and sew costumes, and act. I ' ve always felt fully at home here and couldn ' t imagine going to school anywhere else. Read  15 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; The teachers and staff are excellent examples of a Catholic, Christian life.  They are very caring and will help a student achieve their personal best! Read  104 Reviews Alum : &# xA0; It was an experience I do not think could be replicated anywhere else. I was given the opportunity to cultivate close personal relationships with my peers and professors, and I felt personally cared for by both the professors and the administration. At the same time, the academics were rigorous, and I came to college fully prepared on topics like how to write a well-organized paper, how to deal with a lecture setting, etc. The AP classes were excellent preparation for the college class, and the overall experience molded me in so many ways. Ursuline is not a Jesuit school, but it is my belief that it excellently models the Jesuit mantra of  " cura personalis " : that is, care of the whole person. Read  86 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; I am currently a high school senior at Cabrini. My overall high school experience has been one I will cherish forever because of everything Cabrini has given and taught me. I have grown extremely close to my class of 90 and virtually know almost all of my school ' s community! I am extremely grateful for the rigorous curriculum Cabrini has provided me to prepare me well for college. I am also in many clubs such as student council, ambassadors, and NHS which have helped me enhance my leadership skills. Cabrini has given me so much and I could not imagine myself going anywhere else. The teachers are always incredibly helpful when in need of extra assistance and they are always fair. Read  142 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; St. Scholastica allowed me to develop into a young women. It gave me the opportunity to fight for what I believed, be active in what I love, and thrive in academics. Though there were moments where SSA lacked in spirit and support, I hold firm in the thought that every place has their own flaws. I found the school continued to make a turn around. I can say with confidence, SSA never lacked in love and faith. The teachers care for the students and strive to better their education each day and everyday. Teachers help students balance prayer, work, study, and community. That is what SSA is all about and what it will continue to be. Read  243 Reviews Alum : &# xA0; Northlake is a special place. The teachers invest in their students academically and spiritually. Programs such as the soccer team, powerlifting team, and basketball have been repeatedly recognized in state championships and district championships. There are a wide variety of clubs and ways to get involved for students from all walks of life. College preparedness is crucial to the administration and it is evident due to the college counselors and help lended. I would highly recommend Northlake Christian to anyone who is looking for a school that prioritizes spiritual growth as well as social and academic excellence. Read  23 Reviews Parent : &# xA0; We moved to New Orleans in July between my kid &# x2019;s 10th and 11th grade years; my husband retired from the Army. I contacted De La Salle because we wanted a co-ed and racially, ethnically, and socially diverse school.  Mr. Bonura (no longer at DLS), Ms. Atwood, and Mr. Kelly were wonderful.  DLS accepted my daughter &# x2019;s out-of-state classes as well as previous state Standardized Test Scores and assigned classes that fit her academic progression. When my daughter struggled with the Semester Schedule (this mimics college--classes are offered in an 18-week semester instead of across the whole school year), faculty helped her adjust. DLS is not without the usual teenage-related issues; when my daughter was having trouble with other students, the staff and faculty responded quickly and appropriately without me becoming involved.  If you are moving to NOLA from out-of-town or out-of-state, I encourage you to consider De La Salle! Read  125 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; I &# x2019;ve gone to this school for 5 years and this is my Senior year, and I have enjoyed my time there. It &# x2019;s been a pleasure meeting teachers and students that I will never forget, in all my years there. I &# x2019;ve had the best teachers in every single subject there &# x2019;s no doubt about it. Read  8 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Holy Cross offers a strong academics programs where I have been able to excel. I am currently taking AP and Dual Enrollment Classes.  I have been in honor classes throughout my years at Holy Cross School.  The teachers are well-trained and helpful to the students.  I have had the opportunity to participate in extracurricular programs including sports, clubs and the Holy Cross Tiger Band.  In the Band Program I have mastered my musical talent and am currently playing alto, tenor, clarinet and bassoon. Holy Cross offers strong catholic faith as well.  This year I am serving as an Extraordinary Minister.  I have made lifelong friends at Holy Cross and have come to emulate the value of the Holy Cross Man. Read  51 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; I transferred to Rummel after my freshman year. Upon finishing my 8th grade year I visited. Rummel and liked it but my parents chose another school. Academically the school was not the right fit for me. Once the school year was over my parents enrolled me in Rummel. The school was everything I wanted in a high school. The teachers were insightful and the students were friendly. The atmosphere at Rummel was one where any male school wanting to learn how to lead should be here! Read  50 Reviews Junior : &# xA0; Ever since I stepped foot on Chapelle &# x2019;s campus I felt at home. That &# x2019;s what &# x2019;s so special about Chapelle, the family atmosphere it &# x2019;s always had. The teachers care for the students like they &# x2019;re their own children, the students grow close friendships, and there &# x2019;s an activity for everyone &# x2014; no matter what you &# x2019;re interested in. I wouldn &# x2019;t trade my experience at Chapelle for the world! Read  163 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Pope John Paul II Catholic High has provided me with academic excellence, a Christ-centered educational environment, and leadership skills. Although I am not Catholic, this school has helped me pursue a positive life by teaching personal morality, family life, and social morality. Our yearly, mandatory church and community service hours has positively improved my character development and outlook on life. Volunteering in my community and church has advanced my cooperation and communications skills. This school has given me an excellent education that will help with college preparedness. It offers honors, AP, and dual enrollment classes which I have benefited from. Our history, alma mater, fight song, and culture is what I love most about Pope John Paul II. A change I would like to see is more cultural diversity. I have matured spiritually, emotionally, and academically through these 3 years at this school. Read  47 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; St. Charles Catholic High School is a very welcoming environment that is full of spiritual, academic, and athletic opportunities. St. Charles has an estimated student body of 500 and is a very family oriented school. Everyone knows everyone and this smaller environment makes school feel more like home. The staff is very helpful, and has made my high school experience one that I ' ll never forget. Read  77 Reviews Alum : &# xA0; As a proud alumnus of Archbishop Shaw, it ' s very exciting to see the progress that has been made on campus since I ' ve graduated. Renovated facilities, an increase in student activities, and progressively increasing test scores are steps in the right direction. Your son will not experience the closeness of a family environment at any other school in the city! Save the travel time across the river and put your son at Shaw where he ' ll feel comfortable and safe each day. Read  70 Reviews Parent : &# xA0; I have had four children graduate from this school, after starting in 1st grade.  Three of my children received full or partial scholarships and academic awards that allowed them to go to college.  The school is not perfect, but there is a general consensus to achieve academic excellence and to develop the whole child.  If you are looking for an environment that encourages community, one where students are led to be their best and teachers and staff truly care about the students and their families, this is where you need to go. Read  13 Reviews Freshman : &# xA0; Cambrian is amazing! I took 8th grade there last year, and am now starting 9th. They put me in the classes I was ready for, so even though I was only in 8th grade they allowed me to take high school classes like marine biology and media studies. They even allowed me to take Algebra 2 and then Precalculus online! I was constantly stimulated, challenged, and engaged. I learned a ton! The small class sizes allow for one-on-one interaction with the teachers. The school is perfect for gifted kids, as well as those who just want a higher quality education or a head start on life. Read  15 Reviews Junior : &# xA0; The thing about Palma a High School which is different among other high schools is it &# x2019;s code of conduct and its sports teams. For an all boys school, we follow a code of brotherhood in which we use throughout our daily activities and majorly in sports. It is a private school but the tuition is a little high especially if you are a twin. The food is really bad except for the packaged goods. I would definitely put my kids in this school if I have any due to its school culture and sports program. Other than that, everything is about mediocre.
