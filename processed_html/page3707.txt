How's your weekend going so far? It's been great for us. We found the best deals on Amazon for you to check out while you sip your morning coffee or procrastinate on your chores. There are also a few other impressive sales happening this weekend at eBay, L.L.Bean, and Massdrop. And Dermstore is holding their annual anniversary sale with crazy discounts on makeup too. Tell your wallet I'm not sorry. It ' s hard to believe something so small can make such a dramatic change to your home, but it can. (Photo: TP-Link) Smart plugs can turn most any electronics into smart devices. Being able to toggle the power for things like coffee makers, lights, and curling irons (hint hint) from your phone can be seriously convenient. You can also set schedules, which is great for vacations and morning routines. TP-Link's Kasa plugs are  among our favorites , as they offer great performance at a fantastic price. This model even monitors your energy usage. I personally own four of them and love being able to control them all from one app. They also work with Alexa and Google Assistant, so you can use voice commands if you've got a smart assistant. This discount marks the lowest price we've ever seen, nearly half the original price (which was still not bad), so if you've ever even considered trying a smart plug, this is the ideal time to take the plunge. Get the TP-Link Kasa Smart Plug with Energy Monitoring for $15.99 (Save 45%) Keep this USB charger in your car so you never have to worry about a dead phone in the middle of nowhere. (Photo: Reviewed / RAVPower) If you're taking a family road trip before school is back in session, it's good to be prepared for anything. You don't want to end up with a dead phone battery, no navigation, and no way to call someone for help. This car charger from RAVPower is  the best one we've ever tested  because it's super low-profile and charges a phone in less than two hours. Right now, you can get it for the lowest price we've ever seen with an exclusive coupon code. Just enter " REVIEWED031 " at checkout to save 24%. Get the RAVPower Mini Dual USB Car Charger for $6.49 (Save $2) with the code "REVIEWED031" Combat the clutter with a power strip designed for easier use. (Photo: Anker) Power strips are so necessary these days, but when you've got more than one of those massive plugs, it can be downright impossible to get them all on the same strip. This one from Anker aims to ease that struggle. Half of its 12 outlets run down the center for the normal-sized plugs, and the other half are space out across either side so there's room for everything. It even has three PowerIQ USB charging ports for a total of 15 ways to plug your devices in, and right now you can get it for its lowest price with the code " ANKERBTS ." Get the Anker PowerPort Power Strip for $27.99 with the code "ANKERBTS" (Save $7) These delicate little lights look great anywhere. (Photo: TaoTronics) String lights add ambiance to any room, from nurseries to dens to porches, and these are among the most popular. I have three sets in my apartment, and I love that I can control them from tiny remotes. You can adjust the brightness and try out flashing and pulsing lights at different speeds, and the remotes make it so easy to click them on and off. We got our hands on an exclusive code that will get you the lowest price we've ever seen. Just enter the code  "REVIEWED038"  at checkout to take 20% off the regular cost. Get the TaoTronics LED String Lights, 2-Pack for $19.19 (Save $4.80) with the code "REVIEWED038" Make your vegetable prep much easier. (Photo: Reviewed / Lindsey Mattison) Love home-cooked meals but hate slicing veggies? This mandoline slicer is for you. With five thickness settings and a larger than average finger guard, it outperformed all the other top mandolines on the market  in our tests . Right now you can get your own for just $18. It's only $2 off the regular price, but that's enough to buy a couple veggies to test your slicer! Get the KitchenAid Adjustable Handheld Mandoline Slicer for $17.99 (Save $2) Slim, sleek, and ready to clean your room. (Photo: Eufy) There are loads of robot vacuums available for under $200, but this is  one of our favorites . With a super low profile of just 3 inches, it can fit under virtually every piece of furniture. It also really impressed us in our lab tests with its high suction power, and we loved that it's actually quite quiet. Right now, you can get the usually $230 vacuum for $50 off in black, or $45 off if you prefer the white option. This marks the  lowest price  we've ever seen, making it a great time to buy. Learn more about your heritage and what makes you you. (Photo: AncestryDNA) If you've ever been curious about your heritage, or may just want to confirm Great Aunt Edna's wild stories, a DNA testing kit is a seriously fun way to find out. Ancestry's DNA testing kit is the #1 best seller on Amazon, and easily one of the most well-known options on the market. I tried it and found out my family got most of our history right. But I also learned I've got Viking blood (and now I won't shut up about it). Right now, you can get your own kit for $59, the new lowest price we've ever seen, lower than the previous by $10. Get the Ancestry DNA Genetic Testing Kit for $59 and save $20 We love this Dyson ' s impressive suction and long-lasting battery. (Photo: Reviewed / Jonathan Chan) This is  the best handheld vacuum  we've ever tested, and it's also on sale for the lowest price we've ever seen. In fact it's $2 lower than the previous low (so exciting, right?), and while the roughly $12 difference from the usual sale price might not seem that dramatic of a discount, it doesn't get much better than this for a top performing Dyson. Get the Dyson V7 Car + Boat Handheld Vacuum for $187.90 (Save $12) Rachio makes the best smart sprinklers we ' ve found so far. (Photo: Reviewed / Florence Ion) If you love gardening but have trouble remembering when to water your plants, a smart sprinkler system might be the perfect investment. We've been testing all the popular models all summer and so far, the Rachio 3rd gen. Smart Sprinkler is  the best of the bunch . Its predecessor, the 2nd gen. model, is currently on sale for the lowest price we've ever seen. And, if you prefer top-on-the-line tech, the 3rd gen. model is also a modest 5% off, the first time it's ever gone on sale. These sprinkler systems monitor local weather alerts and make adjustments to your watering schedule (which you can build custom to your garden). You can even give it details about your location, your vegetation, and how much sun your yard gets to get custom recommendations for watering schedules. Both models work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Nest, Samsung SmartThings, IFTTT, and other connected devices and services so you can grow your smart home while you grow your flowers and produce. Even though summer is almost over, this sale is a great way to keep your garden lush as far into fall as possible and get ready for next year. It ' s time to finally start making those smoothies you ' ve been craving. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar) Eufy has made a name for itself in the robot vacuum community (See #1 in this list), but when they launched their first blender, our tester was a bit skeptical. So she was delgihted to find that the MiracleBlend blender was actually pretty impressive. It offered up consistently smooth smoothies in our tests, but struggled a bit when it came to chopping and is not rated to handle hot liquids like soups. However, we loved its blend of capabilities and low price so much that we gave it an  Editors' Choice award , and right now it's on sale for 27% off. Get the eufy MiracleBlend D1 Blender for $94.99 (Save $35) Prices are accurate at the time this article was published, but may change over time.
