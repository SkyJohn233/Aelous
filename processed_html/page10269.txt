On average, every child travels 5,000 miles a year in a car. Child car seats, booster seats and booster cushions offer vital protection for a safer journey. For children under 135cm in height, using an adult seatbelt alone puts your child at higher risk of injury in the event of a collision, in comparison to a purpose-built child car seat or booster. To see if your child needs a car seat,  take a look at our article on car seat laws . It's not just your child's age that you have to consider when choosing a child car seat; you'll also have to consider their weight and height, as well as finding out which seat provides the most secure fit in your car. You should also think about whether your baby or child will be taking long or short journeys and if you'll need to transfer your child car seat from one car to another. We have over 2,800 trained child car seat specialists  in stores  nationwide to help you choose the right seat for your child and your car. You can also  take a look at our online child seats guide  for more information. Only children aged 12 or over or who are over 135cm (4'5") in height can stop using a booster seat. Of course, they must then use adult seatbelts or restraints when travelling in a vehicle.             Help  &  Chat             Need a hand?
