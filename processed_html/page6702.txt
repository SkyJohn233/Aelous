50th Anniversary | Waverley Woollahra Art School We re turning 50 and we want you to celebrate with us. Founded in 1968 we are very proud and excited to be celebrating our 50th Anniversary in 2018.  We are one of Sydney s longest running not for profit art cooperatives, and have been providing quality art classes to the community for 50 years, which we think is a pretty amazing achievement. We are planning several events throughout the year including our upcoming Market Day, a series of master workshops and talks, a kick-your-heels-up Gala Dinner, Tutors  Exhibition, an Archival Project and more. Thank you to everyone who came along and participated in our 50th Anniversary Art Market and Open Day. We will be sharing some videos and pics from the day over the coming weeks.  Sponsors 2018 50th Open Day Your stories We will be inviting you to help tell our history by sharing your stories in our  Archival Video Project  and online portal which we will be launching soon.  We have received a grant from the Royal Historical Society to help us with this project.
