Guide for authors - Current Opinion in Microbiology - ISSN 1369-5274 Search View Cart Sign in to view your account details and order history Download Guide for Authors in PDF Current Opinion in Microbiology  is a systematic review journal that aims to provide specialists with a unique and educational platform to keep up-to-date with the expanding volume of information published in the field of  microbiology . It consists of 6 issues per year covering the following 11 sections, each of which is reviewed once a year: There is also a section that changes every year to reflect hot topics in the field.  Benefits to authors > We also provide many author benefits, such as free PDFs, a liberal copyright policy, special discounts on Elsevier publications and much more. Please click here for more information on our <a href="http: /www.elsevier.com/authors/author-services"> author services  .  >Please see our <a href="http: INTRODUCTION >The Current Opinion journals were developed out of the recognition that it is increasingly difficult for specialists to keep up to date with the expanding volume of information published in their subject. In the Current Opinion journals, we help the reader by providing in a systematic manner: (1) The views of experts on current advances in the field in a clear and readable form. (2) Evaluations of the most interesting papers, annotated by experts, from the great wealth of original publications.<BR >  The aim of the manuscript is to review recent articles, with particular emphasis on those articles published in the  past two years . In addition to describing recent trends, you are encouraged to give your subjective opinion of the topics discussed, although you should not concentrate unduly on your own research. Your review should be approximately 2000 words (not including references or reference notes), with approximately 50 references and, as such, the review is intended to be a concise view of the field as it is at the moment, rather than a comprehensive overview. Our audience ranges from student to professor, so articles must be accessible to a wide readership. Please avoid jargon, but do not oversimplify: be accurate and precise throughout. Occasionally, unpublished data can be referred to, but only when essential and should never be used to substantiate any significant point. Contact details for submission >Submission to this journal is <STRONG>by invitation only< STRONG>. Please contact your Content Development Manager by email if you have any questions. Ethics in publishing ><BR >Please see our information pages on  Ethics in publishing  and  Ethical guidelines for journal publication . Declaration of interest ><BR >All authors must disclose any financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that could inappropriately influence (bias) their work. Examples of potential conflicts of interest include employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, paid expert testimony, patent applications/registrations, and grants or other funding. Authors should complete the declaration of interest statement using  this template  and upload to the submission system at the Attach/Upload Files step. If there are no interests to declare, please choose: 'Declarations of interest: none' in the template. This statement will be published within the article if accepted.  More information . Submission declaration and verification ><BR >Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract, a published lecture or academic thesis, see ' Multiple, redundant or concurrent publication ' for more information), that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, including electronically without the written consent of the copyright-holder. To verify originality, your article may be checked by the originality detection service  Crossref Similarity Check . Preprints >Please note that <a href="https: /www.elsevier.com/about/policies/sharing/preprint">preprints  can be shared anywhere at any time, in line with Elsevier's  sharing policy . Sharing your preprints e.g. on a preprint server will not count as prior publication (see ' Multiple, redundant or concurrent publication ' for more information). Use of inclusive language ><BR >Inclusive language acknowledges diversity, conveys respect to all people, is sensitive to differences, and promotes equal opportunities. Articles should make no assumptions about the beliefs or commitments of any reader, should contain nothing which might imply that one individual is superior to another on the grounds of race, sex, culture or any other characteristic, and should use inclusive language throughout. Authors should ensure that writing is free from bias, for instance by using 'he or she', 'his/her' instead of 'he' or 'his', and by making use of job titles that are free of stereotyping (e.g. 'chairperson' instead of 'chairman' and 'flight attendant' instead of 'stewardess'). Author contributions ><BR >For transparency, we encourage authors to submit an author statement file outlining their individual contributions to the paper using the relevant CRediT roles: Conceptualization; Data curation; Formal analysis; Funding acquisition; Investigation; Methodology; Project administration; Resources; Software; Supervision; Validation; Visualization; Roles/Writing - original draft; Writing - review  &  editing. Authorship statements should be formatted with the names of authors first and CRediT role(s) following.  More details and an example Authors >Please provide the names of all authors in full, including first name. No more than five authors should be listed (only those who contributed to the actual writing of the manuscript, rather than members of the laboratory contributing to primary work). Anyone else who contributed to the article can be thanked in the acknowledgements section< p> Changes to authorship ><BR >Authors are expected to consider carefully the list and order of authors  before  submitting their manuscript and provide the definitive list of authors at the time of the original submission. Any addition, deletion or rearrangement of author names in the authorship list should be made only  before  the manuscript has been accepted and only if approved by the journal Editor. To request such a change, the Editor must receive the following from the  corresponding author : (a) the reason for the change in author list and (b) written confirmation (e-mail, letter) from all authors that they agree with the addition, removal or rearrangement. In the case of addition or removal of authors, this includes confirmation from the author being added or removed. >Only in exceptional circumstances will the Editor consider the addition, deletion or rearrangement of authors <STRONG>after< STRONG> the manuscript has been accepted. While the Editor considers the request, publication of the manuscript will be suspended. If the manuscript has already been published in an online issue, any requests approved by the Editor will result in a corrigendum. Copyright ><BR >Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be asked to complete a 'Journal Publishing Agreement' (see  more information  on this). An e-mail will be sent to the corresponding author confirming receipt of the manuscript together with a 'Journal Publishing Agreement' form or a link to the online version of this agreement. >Subscribers may reproduce tables of contents or prepare lists of articles including abstracts for internal circulation within their institutions. <a href="https: For gold open access articles: Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be asked to complete an 'Exclusive License Agreement' ( more information ).

The "Learn" environment at Researcher Academy offers several interactive modules, webinars, downloadable guides and resources to guide you through the process of writing for research and going through peer review. Feel free to use these free resources to improve your submission and navigate the publication process with ease. Language (usage and editing services) >Please write your text in good English (American or British usage is accepted, but not a mixture of these). Authors who feel their English language manuscript may require editing to eliminate possible grammatical or spelling errors and to conform to correct scientific English may wish to use the <a href="http: /webshop.elsevier.com/languageediting/" class="external-link" rel="_external" target="_blank">English Language Editing service  available from Elsevier's Author Services. Submission ><BR >Our online submission system guides you stepwise through the process of entering your article details and uploading your files. The system converts your article files to a single PDF file used in the peer-review process. Editable files (e.g., Word, LaTeX) are required to typeset your article for final publication. All correspondence, including notification of the Editor's decision and requests for revision, is sent by e-mail. Peer review ><BR >This journal operates a single blind review process. All contributions will be initially assessed by the editor for suitability for the journal. Papers deemed suitable are then typically sent to a minimum of one independent expert reviewer to assess the scientific quality of the paper. The Editor is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles. The Editor's decision is final.  More information on types of peer review . Use of word processing software >It is important that the file be saved in the native format of the word processor used. The text should be in single-column format. Keep the layout of the text as simple as possible. Most formatting codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. In particular, do not use the word processor's options to justify text or to hyphenate words. However, do use bold face, italics, subscripts, superscripts etc. When preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for each individual table and not a grid for each row. If no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns. The electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts (see also the <a href="https: /www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/submit-your-paper">Guide to Publishing with Elsevier ). Note that source files of figures, tables and text graphics will be required whether or not you embed your figures in the text. See also the section on Electronic artwork.  >To avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-check' and 'grammar-check' functions of your word processor.< p> Article structure Subdivision - unnumbered sections >Divide your article into clearly defined sections. Each subsection is given a brief heading. Each heading should appear on its own separate line. Subsections should be used as much as possible when cross-referencing text: refer to the subsection by heading as opposed to simply 'the text'.< p> Introduciton >The introduction should be accessible to a wide variety of scientists by avoiding the use of jargon and concepts not familiar to non-specialists. It should outline the time period covered and the scope of the review, including the importance of and rationale behind your article. The introduction should include only a few background references.< p> Main text of review >Use concise, logical subheadings to provide clear links between the different sections and guide the reader through your review. Please write all abbreviations in full on first use, and use the abbreviation thereafter.< p> Conclusions >The conclusions section should summarise the topics discussed and describe future directions, including the author's opinions, as appropriate.< p> Essential title page information ><BR > Title.  Concise and informative. Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. Avoid abbreviations and formulae where possible. >&bull; <em><STRONG>Author names and affiliations.< STRONG>  Please clearly indicate the given name(s) and family name(s) of each author and check that all names are accurately spelled. You can add your name between parentheses in your own script behind the English transliteration. Present the authors' affiliation addresses (where the actual work was done) below the names. Indicate all affiliations with a lower-case superscript letter immediately after the author's name and in front of the appropriate address. Provide the full postal address of each affiliation, including the country name and, if available, the e-mail address of each author. >&bull; <em><STRONG>Corresponding author.< STRONG>  Clearly indicate who will handle correspondence at all stages of refereeing and publication, also post-publication. This responsibility includes answering any future queries about Methodology and Materials.  Ensure that the e-mail address is given and that contact details are kept up to date by the corresponding author. >&bull; <em><STRONG>Present permanent address.  If an author has moved since the work described in the article was done, or was visiting at the time, a 'Present address' (or 'Permanent address') may be indicated as a footnote to that author's name. The address at which the author actually did the work must be retained as the main, affiliation address. Superscript Arabic numerals are used for such footnotes. Highlights ><BR >Highlights are mandatory for this journal as they help increase the discoverability of your article via search engines. They consist of a short collection of bullet points that capture the novel results of your research as well as new methods that were used during the study (if any). Please have a look at the examples here:  example Highlights .  >Highlights should be submitted in a separate editable file in the online submission system. Please use 'Highlights' in the file name and include 3 to 5 bullet points (maximum 85 characters, including spaces, per bullet point).< Abstract >All reviews should be prefaced by an abstract of 100-120 words. The abstract is important: it should contain sufficient information for the reader to be able to appreciate the relevance of the full article when read alone. It should include background information and specific examples <em>of recent advances< em>, rather than promises that a particular subject 'will be discussed' - the scope of the review should instead appear at the end of the introduction. References should  not  be included. Abbreviations should be avoided as far as possible. Graphical abstract >Although a graphical abstract is optional, its use is encouraged as it draws more attention to the online article. The graphical abstract should summarize the contents of the article in a concise, pictorial form designed to capture the attention of a wide readership. Graphical abstracts should be submitted as a separate file in the online submission system. Image size: Please provide an image with a minimum of 531 &times; 1328 pixels (h &times; w) or proportionally more. The image should be readable at a size of 5 &times; 13 cm using a regular screen resolution of 96 dpi. Preferred file types: TIFF, EPS, PDF or MS Office files. You can view <a href="https: /www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/graphical-abstract">Example Graphical Abstracts  on our information site. >Authors can make use of Elsevier's <a href="https: /webshop.elsevier.com/illustration-services/" class="external-link" rel="_external" target="_blank">Illustration Services  to ensure the best presentation of their images and in accordance with all technical requirements. Acknowledgements >Collate acknowledgements in a separate section at the end of the article before the references and do not, therefore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. List here those individuals who provided help during the research (e.g., providing language help, writing assistance or proof reading the article, etc.).<BR > >Funding bodies should also be mentioned (please give full names rather than abbreviations), together with any relevant grant numbers< p> Formatting of funding sources >List funding sources in this standard way to facilitate compliance to funder's requirements:< p> Funding: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [grant numbers xxxx, yyyy]; the Bill  &  Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA [grant number zzzz]; and the United States Institutes of Peace [grant number aaaa]. >It is not necessary to include detailed descriptions on the program or type of grants and awards. When funding is from a block grant or other resources available to a university, college, or other research institution, submit the name of the institute or organization that provided the funding.< If no funding has been provided for the research, please include the following sentence: >This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.< Units >Follow internationally accepted rules and conventions: use the international system of units (SI). If other units are mentioned, please give their equivalent in SI.< p> Math formulae >Please submit math equations as editable text and not as images. Present simple formulae in line with normal text where possible and use the solidus ( ) instead of a horizontal line for small fractional terms, e.g., X/Y. In principle, variables are to be presented in italics. Powers of e are often more conveniently denoted by exp. Number consecutively any equations that have to be displayed separately from the text (if referred to explicitly in the text). Footnotes >Footnotes should be used sparingly. Number them consecutively throughout the article. Many word processors can build footnotes into the text, and this feature may be used. Otherwise, please indicate the position of footnotes in the text and list the footnotes themselves separately at the end of the article. Do not include footnotes in the Reference list.< p> Artwork Figures >You are encouraged to include up to four additional elements in your review (i.e. a combination of Figures, Tables and Boxes). You should include at least one figure to summarise the main concepts discussed, and all figures should help to explain the concepts discussed in the text. All illustrations should be labelled as figures, and figures should be cited in the main text of the review in numerical order. Please note that it is the responsibility of the authors to obtain permission to reproduce copyrighted material (figures that have been published before) from the original authors and publishers< p> Electronic artwork ><em>General points< em> >&bull; Make sure you use uniform lettering and sizing of your original artwork. <BR >  Embed the used fonts if the application provides that option.  >&bull; Aim to use the following fonts in your illustrations: Arial, Courier, Times New Roman, Symbol, or use fonts that look similar. <BR >  Number the illustrations according to their sequence in the text.  >&bull; Use a logical naming convention for your artwork files. <BR >  Provide captions to illustrations separately.  >&bull; Size the illustrations close to the desired dimensions of the published version. <BR >  Submit each illustration as a separate file. >&bull; Ensure that color images are accessible to all, including those with impaired color vision.<BR >A detailed  guide on electronic artwork  is available. ><STRONG>You are urged to visit this site; some excerpts from the detailed information are given here.< STRONG> ><em>Formats< em> >If your electronic artwork is created in a Microsoft Office application (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) then please supply 'as is' in the native document format. <BR >Regardless of the application used other than Microsoft Office, when your electronic artwork is finalized, please 'Save as' or convert the images to one of the following formats (note the resolution requirements for line drawings, halftones, and line/halftone combinations given below):  >EPS (or PDF): Vector drawings, embed all used fonts. <BR >TIFF (or JPEG): Color or grayscale photographs (halftones), keep to a minimum of 300 dpi.  >TIFF (or JPEG): Bitmapped (pure black &amp; white pixels) line drawings, keep to a minimum of 1000 dpi. <BR >TIFF (or JPEG): Combinations bitmapped line/half-tone (color or grayscale), keep to a minimum of 500 dpi. ><STRONG>Please do not:< STRONG>  >&bull; Supply files that are optimized for screen use (e.g., GIF, BMP, PICT, WPG); these typically have a low number of pixels and limited set of colors; <BR >  Supply files that are too low in resolution;  >&bull; Submit graphics that are disproportionately large for the content.< p> Color artwork >Please make sure that artwork files are in an acceptable format (TIFF (or JPEG), EPS (or PDF) or MS Office files) and with the correct resolution. If, together with your accepted article, you submit usable color figures then Elsevier will ensure, at no additional charge, that these figures will appear in color online (e.g., ScienceDirect and other sites) in addition to color reproduction in print. <a href="https: /www.elsevier.com/authors/author-schemas/artwork-and-media-instructions">Further information on the preparation of electronic artwork . Figure captions >Ensure that each illustration has a caption. The caption should describe the figure in full, without further reference to the main text. A caption should comprise a brief title (<STRONG>not< STRONG> on the figure itself) and a description of the illustration. Supply captions separately, not attached to the figure. All abbreviations used in the figure and not in the main text should be defined at the end of the figure legend. References which appear in the figure itself should be mentioned in the figure caption as well. Tables and boxes >Tables should be used to tabulate data discussed in further detail in the review. Boxes should be used for additional explanatory material that, although essential, interrupts the flow of the text. In addition, you can include a glossary box to describe define terms or abbreviations used in your review. Tables and boxes should always be referred to in the main text of the article and should have an appropriate title. Please use the template in MS Word to create your tables. All such text boxes will be included in the main text word count, and must be cited in the text in numerical order. Citation in text >The reference list should not be exhaustive - simply alert the reader to the most innovative recent papers and key reviews. Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the reference list (and vice versa). Unpublished results and personal communications are not recommended in the reference list but may be mentioned in the text. References should be numbered consecutively in the order in which they are cited in the text, followed by those that are only cited in the figure legends or tables. Please ensure that each item in the reference list has its own number, avoiding joint references (for example, references [32a,32b] should be listed and cited as [32,33] and subsequent references numbered accordingly). Papers accepted as 'in press' may be included.< p> Reference management software >Most Elsevier journals have their reference template available in many of the most popular reference management software products. These include all products that support <a href="http: /citationstyles.org" class="external-link" rel="_external" target="_blank">Citation Style Language styles , such as  Mendeley . Using citation plug-ins from these products, authors only need to select the appropriate journal template when preparing their article, after which citations and bibliographies will be automatically formatted in the journal's style. If no template is yet available for this journal, please follow the format of the sample references and citations as shown in this Guide. If you use reference management software, please ensure that you remove all field codes before submitting the electronic manuscript.
