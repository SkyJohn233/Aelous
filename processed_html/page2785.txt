Dance Moves for Ducks: How to Recognize Courtship Displays | Bird Academy • The Cornell Lab See courting ducks in action. These displays are key mating behaviors to look for. Mallard Head-Pumping:  Males and females rhythmically bob their heads. This display is often repeated and followed by mating. Mallard Head-Up-Tail-Up:  With a loud whistle, the drake pulls his wings and tail up, shows off his purple-blue secondaries and compresses his body. This is a quick gesture, often given by males in a group to impress the female. King Eider Pushing-Reaching:  Male places the bill tip close to water with chin close to breast then thrusts head forward. Common Goldeneye Head-Throw-Kick:  Male thrusts his head forward, then lowers head backward with his bill pointed up and utters a single call. Afterward he thrusts his head quickly forward, sometimes kicking water with his feet. Red-breasted Merganser Salute:  Curtsy Crest is quickly lowered and head dropped to just above water, then neck is stretched up forming a straight line; chest and neck then dropped into the water and tail is tucked under.
