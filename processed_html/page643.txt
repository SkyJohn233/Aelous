Man charged with Papakura murder given name suppression - NZ Herald  A man charged with the murder of the mother of four who was found dead in her Papakura home has appeared in court today.  He was given name suppression during a brief appearance at Papakura District Court.  His lawyer Tony Bouchier said outside the court the charges would be "very rigorously defended" and that his client is "mortified".  Inside court, Mr Bouchier said the man needed to inform family that he had been arrested and should therefore have name suppression.  He was remanded in custody by consent until August 27.  A court document listed the charge as "murder (stab)".  A number of family members were at court for today's hearing.  Earlier, Detective Inspector Mark Gutry said police arrested a 43 year-old Manurewa man at 8pm last night.  Mr Gutry said the same man had been released on bail after appearing in Papakura District Court earlier this week on charges of damaging Ms Kingston's car.  The man appeared in court on both charges this morning.  Mr Gutry would not comment on whether the man had a relationship with Ms Kingston.  Ms Kingston's body was found by one of her four sisters in the bathroom of her Cargill St home near a smashed window about 4pm.  Forensic experts will finish examining the scene today and detectives will complete their area canvas.
