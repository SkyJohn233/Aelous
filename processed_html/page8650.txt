Cassowaries - Son of a F*ck! : funny I saw a Cassowary at a natural environment zoo.  There was a sign posted that asked visitors not to look the Cassowary in the eye.  Apparently it wasn &# x27;t above trying to get at you if you tempted it.  The wall didn &# x27;t look high enough. I want one guarding my house. Robber approaches house ><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">Cassowary strolls around corner< em> >&quot;Da fuq is this?&quot;< p> Cue screams of agony Saw one at Vienna zoo. The chain-link fence didn &# x27;t look nearly strong enough for this fucker. Just something about this animal exudes a  " don &# x27;t come near me or I will fuck you up "  aura, even without knowing how dangerous they actually are. Ah, good thing a top comment here is suggesting to look them in the eye and stand your ground if you encounter one. Reddit will kill me some day. I went to a zoo in Brisbane I think? They had warning signs that stated to not get too close to the railings, because they could reach it. Why the hell would they not just move the railings another foot higher or farther back till they could not reach!? I know someone who worked at a zoo and supposedly the Cassawary was the only animal they would shoot to kill if it ever escaped. Everything else they would try to drug or capture. Like they were more comfortable with a cheetah escaping and shit. http://i.imgur.com/fsP2gg7.gif http://imgur.com/bLRVQ2H What the hell was that guy trying to prove? http://i.imgur.com/S5G1tJW.jpg Bring it. If you &# x27;re wondering, the question is yes: these guys, and all birds, are descended from a dinosaur family very closely related to dromaeosaurids such as  Velociraptor . Raptors  in reality  looked more like this thing than the raptors we saw in Jurassic Park. Really.
