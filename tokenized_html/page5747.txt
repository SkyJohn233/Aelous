top ten greatest men thetoptens well he was ranked as number 1 in michael h. hart 's book the 100 he did many great things in his life he always thought of others he loved and died poor he did n't seek revenge the sad thing is that people always try to ruin his greatness by saying lies about him and they try to destroy his view but they always fail because people who read about his life will know why did he deserve to be the number 1 upon all humans read about his battles and the aftermath so you can know and understand that he did n't fight for glory or money and that he did n't force anyone to convert to islam and know how he treated his enemies and the people around him no matter what muslims do we will never be able to thank him or be even 10 like him trust me he is almost perfect so never believe what ignorants say about him because there r hundreds of books that wrote about his true life so try reading them because his life was hard yet happy may god guide you to more yeah actually read the hadith and you 'll know all these positive statements are lies themselves and most of what they label as lies come from the only sources we have for muhammad 's life islam is a joke peace be upon him may he takes us to the heaven with him i love and respect him more than any human being in the whole wide world he is the greatest human being ever to live.. because he is the prophet for not only muslims but for all man kind and he is the man mostly followed by the most number of peoples in the world i do not like to make any statements which makes hurt to any religion but one thing being the truth that is for the mankind there is any speech/direction like the hadith and speech of last pilgrimage made by any other prophet or religious leader ever so other than the quran the said speech and hadith is sufficient to prove that undoubtedly muhammad is the number 1 greatest man of the world yes he is the best man in the world like him no one can become and no one come like hi there 's so much that could be said about this amazing man none of which i can properly and eloquently describe the prophet muhammad 's life was the hardest life that anyone will ever endure a life which no one but him could bear to live as a child he lost both his parents and witnessed the terrible ways the people around him lived their lives he saw his enemy wrip the body of his uncle and chew his internal organs he most beloved to god could 've wished ill on his enemies who constantly pursued him he who was the last messenger of god could 've changed the message he was trusted with to exalt himself and make his life easier guranteed his safety what did he do anyone who is honest with themselves would know that not only is muhammad the best of our kind but the last prophet of god.please for the sake of the tears he shed the comforts he gave up for you honor him and stop telling lies this selfless man deserves our respect those who lie about him will rot in hell more he is without comparison regardless of your personal beliefs jesus christ has objectively influenced humanity in thought devotion and deed in terms of quality and quantity more than any mortal being history has and will ever know one aspect of his greatness may be seen in the greatness of his influence his influence moreover his extensive influence was not owing to things he wrote built invented conquered discovered developed or dreamed his influence was most particularly the result of who he is and what he did on behalf of guilty and morally corrupt people he is the only substitute the world will ever know he is the greatest whoever came to the earth and gave his life for the salvation of mankind reconciling them to god and giving them purpose for life and promised heaven to everyone who believes in him as the way the truth and the life i love jesus very much however jesus is out of this poll because according to your belief jesus is god right and you can not compare a man kind with god it will be unfair of course you know that because jesus is only the way the truth and the life when you visit the grave of any person that they considered as a god they will found a dead body but when we visit the grave of jesus we found nothing because jesus raise again years are reckoned before and after him because of christianity has been eminently intertwined within the culture and development of the so-called western civilization which indeed has come to be the very central axis of power for at least the last 500 years and even though the current status quo is set to change in the upcoming decades it is still the hub of might in the world and will probably remain important because not only muslim countries are growing faster but also some primarily christian countries in its many varieties are believed to be powers in this century brazil mexico and the philippines for instance and it 's a growing importance religion in africa too within countries like the congo and mozambique so for these and many other reasons christianity and thus jesus christ has decisively shaped the modern-day world great scientist he was a great man devc6380 science he is a good sinceist he was truly a greatest person ever he have rejected all the concepts which can not be proven scientifically practically in real life he never accepts anything simply because it has been delivered/preached by a elders or popular figure he rejected the existence of god or any supernatural power which will change the human life he suggested that only we can bring changes in our life by following 'middle path and attain nirvana the entire world will live peacefully by following him before buddha did man ever know that he could live as great a life as proposed by him his self-control

buddhism acknowledge the pain of life joy of life life is meaningful and got the answer of all humankind 's wonder what 's the right and best way to live the answer is noble eightfold path and vipasana and samatha and if i know better about buddhism i would confidentially tell you what buddhism teach but let me tell you this my knowledge about buddhism is not enough to teach other people 'what is buddhism means and teach but my life is far better and going to the light because i study buddhism this much but i suggest do not assume what buddhism is and that like in a bad way do not lie

to rip his country away from the jewish bankers of the world and developed a new currency free of usury and inflation he is the reason germany rose to power during the 1920 's but his economic plans

death and the demonization of national socialism the world has been crumbling from economic collapse to civil wars hitler was a man who intensely loved his country and it pained him greatly to see it suffering so much during the great depression the germans were badly oppressed under the unfair terms they were forced to agree to after wwi forced into being the scapegoats for a war that was n't
