Minnesota Vikings: Top 10 QBs in franchise history - Page 11 1. Fran Tarkenton Tarkenton s history with the Vikings goes back to their very first season in 1961. The QB was picked by Minnesota in the third round of the  61 draft and was the starter for the franchise s very first game. Though Fran himself had some success in his first few years with the Vikings, being named to the Pro Bowl in 1964 and 1966, the team did not win a ton of games and Tarkenton clashed with coach Norm Van Brocklin. After the  66 season, the combative Tarkenton was traded to the New York Giants where he would spend the next five years. In 1971 Tarkenton made his way back to Minnesota, now coached by Bud Grant, and helped the team achieve an unprecedented level of success. Tark led the Vikings to Super Bowl appearances in 1973, 1975 and 1976. Sadly, he and the Vikes would go on to lose all three Super Bowls. Tarkenton himself won the NFL MVP award in 1975. Fran finished his career as the all-time leading passer in Vikings history with 33,098 yards, a record he still holds (and may hold forever). Fran entered the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1986.  He returned to Canton in 2015  to help induct his old center Mick Tingelhoff. < \/p>\n From Fran Tarkenton to Daunte Culpepper, the Vikings have had some very talented men line up behind center during their history. < \/p>\n Gritty journeymen like Gary Cuozzo and Brad Johnson have made their contributions to Vikings lore despite never putting up big numbers. < \/p>\n Legendary Hall-of-Famers like Warren Moon and Brett Favre have joined the Vikings late in their careers, hoping for one last shot at glory. < \/p>\n Young sensations like Tommy Kramer and the aforementioned Culpepper have excited fans with their great talent and frustrated them by their failure to live up to their full potential. < \/p>\n Players like Joe Kapp and Randall Cunningham have come in for short stints and helped the Vikings go on improbable, but ultimately failed, championship runs. < \/p>\n These then are the top ten QBs in Minnesota Vikings history. < \/p>\n Next:  < \/span> Old-school journeyman < \/span> < \/a> < \/div>
