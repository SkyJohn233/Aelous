HI All, Just wondering what happens if you exceed the 50 ip limit on the home edition of sophos utm? Does the utm stop all together? Or does it just not protect the rest of the ip addresses? Thanks scorpionking 0 5 Sep 2013 4:58 AM No, it does not stop alltogether. But all clients above the limit won ' t get through... BarryG 0 5 Sep 2013 6:11 PM Hi, there ' s a 10% or so excess allowed, so you can hit 55 or so before new IPs start getting blocked. Barry balletbob 0 9 Sep 2013 1:09 AM Ok, so if you had home edition in bridge mode between a router and modem, would this still be a problem? or as there is only one device directly connected to the UTM (or two if you include the modem) would it be fine? (what about all devices behind router if more than 50?) BarryG 0 9 Sep 2013 2:58 AM Hi, if the router is doing NAT, then the license count would only see 1 IP, but this is not in compliance with the intent of the license.
