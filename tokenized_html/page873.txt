bttv emote box doesn x27 t have any emotes in the favorite emotes section twitch i x27 ve been using bttv for a while and i like the emote box any body else have a problem where they don x27 t have any emotes in the favorite emotes section i x27 m not at my pc atm but isn x27 t that the section where you have to add your favorite emotes by hitting the edit button at the bottom there s a guy who almost always watches my streams some days he lurks some days he chats but he s always so nice and supportive and he actually thinks my stream is fun i honestly look forward to streaming at this point for him tonight he asked if i d be on tomorrow and i said yeah and he said love watching your stream lol it s fun d it was so satisfying to read so wanted to share the love ❤️ edit typo first time i saw it it was whatever now i get that shit everytime i open someone x27 s streams the fucking are you kidding me right now that overdramatic screech that rips through my ear drums the thank you coke yesterday i was streaming some cs go and after i was a bit over 2 hours in i randomly look over at my second monitor and i had like 500 viewers i immediately like any normal person checked my notifications to see if i missed a huge raid or host and nothing was there i then assumed it was a glitch on my end and it would go away then after 10-15 more minutes it still was fluctuating between 400-700 viewers i check on the actual twitch site and there i am with 500 viewers and on the top like 10 cs streams at the time i continued to stream for the next like 3 hours and maintained 400-700 viewers the entirety of the time my average for the past 30 days went from 4 to 40 one of the weirdest things about this was i had 1 new follower and no new people talk in chat besides my friends and my regulars which is actually kind of slow compared to the norm i want answers im so confused just to pre empt what i m going to say i m not talking about subscriptions recently with all the news of the big streamers signing contracts making big money which is awesome get that bread i started thinking about donations i m not here to tell anybody how to spend their own money but just an idea maybe every so often instead of donating to the people making tens of thousands a month maybe pop by a smaller streamer that you enjoy and send the dono their way i m not saying stop donating to the big dogs i m just saying every so often it would be nice to make a difference to someone who might actually need the money i don t think a few less donations to the big streamers will hurt their pockets as i imagine most of their income is based off subs brand deals streaming contracts etc as i say just a thought at this time of year where money unfortunately is an issue for a lot of people i create graphics and motion design for content creators i released a free download of my snow fx made in after effects on my instagram and thought this would be a good place to share and get streams into a holiday mood it x27 s very simple soft white snow that slowly drifts down the screen seamlessly it x27 s transparent add it as a media source in obs or slobs and set to loop you can of course resize it to your liking and change the opacity etc using a color correction filter 1080p 60fps webm download https //drive.google.com/file/d/13brb0aa3il6iw6dlkh0ljhvoz9cbknij/view usp=sharing i x27 m fine with ads i x27 m fine with disabling ad blocker i x27 m fine with supporting the streams but eventually i need to be able to get to the content i am not the kind of person who watches the same stream for hours on end i probably follow ~100 channels and at night will spend around an hour hopping from channel to channel the whole time checking in on creators i enjoy i used to get a forced ad for the first stream i turned on then i could pop around now i get the 60 seconds oh my god coke wtf ad for every single channel i can x27 t just pop around so i x27 m forced to open like 15 tabs to do them all at once and then pause or mute them just me i x27 m watching capcom cup just now and i x27 ve set my resolution to 1080p source but for some reason it keeps on scaling down to 480p without me touching anything i have to set it back to 1080p source but later on it goes back to 480p it x27 s very annoying and irritating how do i prevent that from happening i x27 ve been getting a few kids on my channel during the last couple of weeks they seem to enjoy my stream and have become regulars i don x27 t curse a lot or talk about 18+ stuff much except from a few comments here and there sometimes i play games that aren x27 t really suitable for kids but they watch anyway i even give warnings about the games before i play them however another fellow streamer told me i should ban all underage viewers if i have the maturity setting switched on which i do according to him it x27 s a violation of the tos p mind you i know their age because they freely told me i never ask any personal questions to viewers beyond how x27 s your day going and some other banal stuff people share what they want and i try to keep the conversation alive p is it true that what i x27 m doing is against tos i x27 ve tried to find that section but couldn x27 t figure it out thanks in advance p edit they are older than 13 just wanted to clarify that title is pretty much explanatory i m getting this problem across multiple browsers and no amount of clearing caches or cookies has helped i have a lot of cool ideas for channel points but features like the wiggling active viewer bonus chest are a no go for me i really don t want my regulars to feel like they need to be clicking that to stay competitive and since i run reruns off-hours someone could easily write a script to automatically click it when it pops up 24/7 for clarity here are the earn rates i m talking about https //i.imgur.com/a7nhbzg.png the special bonus chest is pretty egregious a subscriber can earn 240 points per hour by watching but clicking the chest every 15 minutes produces an additional 400 points an hour i d really like to be able to adjust the earn rates for points across the channel like i can do with any bot s loyalty currency i browsed all around my dashboard and its still locked after the recent twitch update anything i need to do to unlock this feature now go on twitch click on streamer currently live long ad oh my god what the hell what s going on click on another streamer oh my god what the hell what s going on click on another oh my god what the hell what s going on and another oh my god what the hell what s going on and another oh my god what the hell what s going on sudghuisrhgsbgtugsyutgryagfusdgghdyhguigyh 597k bleed purple 4.5k online aug 9 2010 cake day
