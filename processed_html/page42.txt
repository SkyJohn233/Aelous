On OS X, can you force Chrome to open a new window on your current desktop rather than switch to the desktop that currently has Chrome opened? - Super User                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 Say I have Desktop 1 (D1) and Desktop 2 (D2). I am currently focused on D2 and want to open a new Chrome window but there is already a window open in D1. I want to make it so that when I click the Chrome icon in the dock it opens a new window on the existing desktop rather than switching to the desktop with an open window. Is there a way to do this for all applications (new "instance" rather than switching focus to an existing one)? If you right click the Dock icon  &  select Options > None then later, right-clicking the Dock icon  &  selecting New Window will open on the current Space. I'm not certain how well that will work if you have "Displays have separate Spaces" enabled ( &  I'm not messing up my 6-Space, 2-Display layout to find out;) in System Prefs > Mission Control.
