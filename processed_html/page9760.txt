The 50 Best Game of Thrones Characters, Ranked - Page 27 Shireen, you were too pure for this world. This princess was wise beyond her years and extremely well-read, but all that knowledge couldn t save her when the Lord of Light came calling.  The adorable Kerry Ingram gives us a Princess Shireen who was easy to like. The young girl was a victim of the terrible Greyscale curse, but it was something she wore with bravery. She never let it affect her, and drew the kindest souls in Westeros to her (like Ser Davos). She s only a teenager, but has a clear bullsh*t detector in place, and is not afraid to swing it around when necessary. For example, when discussing how Melisandre s victims scream when put to the torch, the Red Woman tells Shireen that women also scream when giving birth. The little princess snarks right back, saying women don t end up as bone and ash after childbirth. We had to witness her agonizing death at the hands of her own family, all thanks to a religious mania that got out of hand. Maybe the Baratheon House wasn t meant to survive the game if they were willing to let such a precious soul go up in smoke. < \/p>\n Game of Thrones < \/em> has an incredibly deep bench of characters, and there will be more in Season 7.
