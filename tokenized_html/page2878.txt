untitled document lawrence veale demonstrating the revealer about 20 years ago i discovered the revealer in the building maintenance dept of watney 's brewery trowbridge they used it for locating pipes around pubs etc the architect also used it on weekends to mark out the postholes of old archaeological sites of course i was extremely sceptical until they actually demonstrated the instrument i decided i had to have one and set about tracking them down after much searching i encountered the inventor lawrence veale 's wife in kingskerswell devon lawrence had died a few years prior and she was about 85 not really too interested in marketing the product i purchased a revealer from her and started to practice finding pipes was really easy and as i was involved with building surveyors clerks of works etc it soon became a topic of conversation a few people asked me to find 'stuff and i did i 'dowsed stonehenge lived nearby and was amazed at the power of the leylines which were actually in the air a number of people asked me if they could purchase a revealer i contacted mrs veale again and she still had a few machines so i bought them all from her she was particularly pleased that her husband 's lifetime work would be continued she gave me all the drawings plans etc and her blessing to carry on the revealer a few years later i moved to the usa taking 3 or 4 revealers with me i was in sales and met a number of sales guys at a business meeting and the topic of dowsing came up i showed them my revealer and they all wanted one so i was quickly down to my last one they guys were persistant and asked me to get more which of course i could not do so after much deliberation my wife and i decided to make them we had the plans and lawrence veale 's secrets thanks to his wife so we purchased a lathe and started to make them our greatest problem was the chrome plating it was expensive and slow still we made a number of revealers and sold them through these sales guys i remember virginia as being the best area my late friend ian wallace really did well there you may trip over one or two there all this happened about 15-20 years ago and when we sold the last few we did n't make any more we had bigger fish to fry and our marketing guys had dissapeared from our lives recently my wife and i retired and we got to talking about the fun we had using making and selling revealers we realised that now we had the internet to market these items and it would be a completely different deal we could make videos produce cds and we have n't got anything else to do it 'll keep us out of mischief for ages so that is why i am here we purchased a new lathe last week and will start production in about 1 month we do n't even have a problem with the chrome plating as i own www.caswellplating.com mike caswell here is an original revealer complete in it 's carrying case this item was recently sold on ebay here are the two sections of a wand note the discs are numbered 2 4 6 9 and 15 denoting pipe diameters note the black stripe on the lower section this is used for determining pipe depth links to interesting sites the british society of dowsers british society of dowsers forum tom graves refers to the revealer homing conductance dowsing a review of experimantal research yahoo groups dowsing forum revealer operating procedure instrument setup operating stance and walk locating a pipe locating a pipe junction determining pipe diameter determining pipe composition determining pipe depth locating septic tanks locating manholes locating a break in a pipe finding building foundations locating graves locating caves and voids
