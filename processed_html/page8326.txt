Protein tyrosine kinases in neutrophil activation and recruitment. Zarbock A(1), Ley K. >< Author information:  >(1)Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, University of Münster, Germany. zarbock@uni-muenster.de< p> >< Migration of leukocytes into tissue is a key element of innate and adaptiveimmunity. The first contact of leukocytes with endothelial cells is mediated byengagement of selectins with their counter-receptors which results in leukocyterolling. During rolling, leukocytes collect different inflammatory signals thatactivate intracellular signaling pathways. Integration of these signals inducesleukocyte activation, firm arrest, post-adhesion strengthening, intravascularcrawling, and transmigration. In neutrophils, like in T-cells and platelets, bothG-protein-coupled receptor-dependent and -independent activation pathways existthat lead to integrin activation. Accumulating evidence suggests that differentprotein tyrosine kinases play key roles in signal transduction pathwaysregulating neutrophil activation and recruitment to inflammatory sites. Thisreview focuses on the role of protein tyrosine kinases of the Src, Syk, and Tecfamilies for neutrophil activation and recruitment.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. ><
