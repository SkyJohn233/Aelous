Business leaders from across Michigan have sent the message loud and clear to lawmakers — our state’s ability to create and attract jobs, and help our residents find economic security, hinges on filling the talent gap our state now faces. The skills gap in Michigan threatens the competitiveness of businesses and our workforce. By 2025, more than 60 percent of Michigan jobs will require education beyond high school, such as a post-secondary degree or professional or technical certificate. Despite this looming need, only 44 percent of adults in Michigan have that level of education. Tim Daman (Photo: submitted photo) Michigan’s shortage of skilled, educated workers is especially noticeable to business owners — who often are unable to find the talent they need to fill good, high-paying jobs. In a recent polling of their members, the Lansing Regional Chamber of Commerce found that 57 percent of respondents listed “talent, attraction, development and retention,” as one of their top three business needs. Sixty-eight percent listed “talent and workforce development,” as one of the three most important policy issues facing their business, and 26 percent listed education as the top need. The Michigan Higher Education Attainment Roundtable (MIHEART) is a broad coalition of business, military, law enforcement, philanthropic, education and government leaders who recognize and value the importance of higher education and the critical role it plays in closing the talent gap. The group released the Total Talent Report in September detailing the need to support strategies that help Michiganders earn employer-valued post-secondary credentials, degrees and certificates. MIHEART recently hosted a Talent Summit to educate members of Michigan’s 100th Legislature and the Whitmer administration on the urgency of supporting education beyond high school for all Michigan citizens. The message was simple — nothing is more central to our ability as a state to create and attract jobs, and ensure strong economic growth, than giving Michigan residents the tools they need to succeed. The most important tool in that toolbox is post-secondary education. Dialogue and discussion alone will not produce the results our state needs. The Michigan College Access Network (MCAN), a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing college readiness, participation and completion in Michigan, leads the state’s post-secondary educational attainment movement. The organization has multiple initiatives dedicated to helping students better understand how to apply for college and financial aid — and how to be successful once they get there. One of the biggest issues facing prospective students is affordability — which is why the Michigan College Cash Campaign runs from November through March and aims to increase the number of Michigan students who submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to find money for school. Since launching the Michigan College Cash Campaign, MCAN has seen an improvement in the percentage of high school seniors who submitted their FAFSA — but there’s still work to be done. In 2018, only 64 percent of graduating high school seniors completed the FAFSA. Every high school senior should be submitting the paperwork, as it is strongest indicator of a student’s eventual college enrollment. Together, we encourage leaders from every sector to embrace and support initiatives that will increase the number of Michigan students who pursue education beyond high school. Their future, and our state’s economic vitality, depend on it.
