t have a game-day party without buffalo chicken wings on the buffet table — inconceivable the solution obviously is to turn to the next best thing the oven doused in a double dose of hot sauce — first to marinate and then to coat — these oven-baked wings are arguably just as crispy just as sticky and just as irresistible as their deep-fried brethren here s how to make a batch for yourself you only need four ingredients not including the blue cheese and celery real-deal buffalo wings get deep-fried then tossed in a mixture of butter and hot sauce crispy fried skin and tender chicken plus sticky sauce is pretty much a done deal as every bar menu can attest and yes deep-frying these little wings certainly gives them the crispiest most succulent coat but i d argue that there s something even better about roasting them in the oven the hot sauce marinade bakes right into the meat infusing it completely and i like how the wings pick up some smoky charred bits here and there kitchn cooking

lookout for your first lesson plus these oven-roasted wings still get tossed in sticky sauce so they still look the part with none the wiser plus you can make huge batches for hungry crowds without having to stand at constant attendance plus these wings are arguably a healthier or at least a less un -healthy party food that s a lot of pluses do you know all the parts of a chicken wing when you eat chicken wings you re actually eating only 2/3 of the wing since the whole chicken wing is separated into three pieces some grocery stores and butchers sell you wings whole and unseparated — meaning the tip wingette forearm and drumette upper arm are all connected in one piece however many other groceries sell the wings already separated into wingettes and drumettes and if they don t you can always ask your butcher to chop the wing up for you if you do need to chop up whole wings into the smaller parts here s how you do it first look for the joints there will be one connecting the wing tip to the forearm and another connecting the forearm to the upper arm wiggle the joints back and forth a few times until you get a feel for where they re connected then cut right through the hinge of the joint — use the heel of your knife not the tip or front of your knife and push straight down hard i often press the top of the knife with my opposite hand for extra force if all goes well you ll cut straight through the cartilage between the bones and separate the parts cleanly if your knife hits bone and gets stuck move it slightly closer to the middle of the joint and try again after a dozen of these you ll get a feel for it for buffalo wings we re only interested in the forearm and the upper arm you can discard the wing tips or save them for the next time you make stock you can collect the tips in a freezer bag and keep them frozen for several months the hot sauce you use on these wings is really up to you pick your sauce frank s texas pete sriracha or cholula anything hot will do it s up to you to calibrate the heat to your own taste for really classic buffalo wing flavor frank s redhot claims to be the original hot sauce used in original hot wings and it does indeed have that spicy but not too spicy tangy heat we associate with restaurant-style hot wings so you can t go wrong there serves 6 to 8 prep time 15 minutes cooking time 25 minutes to 30 minutes chicken

sheet aluminum foil cut up the chicken wings if necessary if the wings are whole and not yet separated use a chef x27 s knife or kitchen shears to cut through the first joint of the wing and remove the wing tip discard or keep for chicken stock if you x27 d like smaller pieces you can also cut through the second joint to separate the wing into the forearm and upper arm portions take the chill off the wings leave the wings on the counter while you prepare the sauce to take the chill off otherwise the butter sauce will congeal when you toss them if this happens though it x27 s fine just
