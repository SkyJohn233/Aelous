Internet Forums Reimagined: The Future Of Online Discussions We detected that you only gave partial or no consent.

But what does the future have in store for us in terms of communicating online? The latest iteration of online communication may indeed be social media, but it seems that the  most popular  avenue is still the old-fashioned  internet forum . It remains today as an excellent way to structure a community on the web. While social media can be somewhat amorphous at times, forums provide order and a sense of home. I believe that forums will never die out, but forums  will  evolve and adapt to advancements in web technology. Please join me as I take a look at a few  forum software systems  that are so innovative that they’ll transform the concept of the forum forever. Moot (Beta) is a very interesting project in my eyes because there s a bit of tension in its design philosophy: it wants to take a step back into the past and recover the lost relevance of  meaningful  discussion (which they claim have died with social media) while incorporating features of the future (clean and responsive interface). But more importantly, Moot is entirely  embeddable , meaning you don t need to download a package and upload it to your own web host. Instead, all of the data and control is done through your Moot account and your forum theme; forum content are embedded directly into your site wherever you want it to go. It has been designed from the ground up for complete and easy integration. Other notable features that Moot is pushing: The mentality spurring the Discourse team is the desire to  raise the standard of discussion on the web through better forum software.  Core to their actions is the belief that forums are an integral aspect of proper web communities, yet most forum designs are stuck in the 1990s. With Discourse, they want to make forum hosting easy, flexible, and appealing to the 21st Century. The Discourse interface takes a lot of inspiration from social media: just-in-time loading of content, flat and sleek aesthetics that are indicative of social media design, @replying to users, logging in with social media accounts, real-time stream updates, and more. But unlike Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, and the others, Discourse remains faithful to big blocks of text for deeper, more meaningful conversation. Other notable features that Discourse is pushing: We took a detailed look at  Discourse  when it emerged on the scene. Moot and Discourse are relative newcomers to the forum scene, but Vanilla has been innovating the forum concept for years already. Honestly, ask anyone (who has forum experience, obviously) which forum software is the most non-traditional and I m willing to bet that most would say Vanilla. Vanilla has gained a lot of traction over the years. Big name sites, like  Penny Arcade , are starting to turn to it for their discussion needs because of its cutting edge design. This is a free, open source project that really is revolutionizing the forum landscape. Other notable features that Vanilla is pushing: On paper, these systems may not seem like a huge deviation from the usual forum platforms that we typically see. However, paper can be deceiving. Take one look at each of the solutions above and you ll notice a landslide difference in the end user experience. And in my humble opinion, all three systems are doing a heck of a job in refreshing the boring realm of forums. Do you use forums? Know of any other forum systems that are revolutionizing the field?

Required fields are marked  * Comment Name  * Email  * Ok following the link to Vanilla, which seems to be your favorite in this article, I notice that it is neither free or open source. You might want to update the page to make note of that. I don't know the software they use bur debate.org is an innovative forum. There's also a small austrian startup creating a new, fast and modern forum software:  http://ubergrape.com/ In action:  http://tgfred.com/ (caution: site language is german) disclaimer: i'm working for them Very reminiscent of Reddit's structure. Looks interesting and I'll follow its development to see if I end up liking it. Thanks! Still better that XenForo, also less expensive (the open source ones) Another alternative to that list: Iroquote  http://www.iroquote.com I'm the founder, and we've been around since October 2012 (before Moot and Discourse), but we're still in alpha. Our public beta will launch next week, so keep an eye and experiment with our forums soon. :) I promise there are some awesome features that you won't find in Discourse, Moot, nor Vanilla. Best of luck! "[…]we’ve been around since October 2012 (before Moot […])" To correct this one slightly—Moot has been around since 2009 and we published our efforts to re-imagine web discussion at  http://moot.it  in the beginning of 2010. As for features you will or will not find in Moot; we launched Moot open beta in April with a minimal set of features to be able to prioritize our roadmap; since your post 5 days ago, there's been one update with major, new, unique features, with several in the pipeline over the next few months. Oops, my bad then, sorry about the dates. As for features, I'm positive that Discourse and Moot are delivering quite a lot (more than Iroquote), but I was referring to features that cannot be in these because of the nature of these products. Moot, Vanilla and Discourse are forum software for *sites* (or for some forum *owner*), while Iroquote is for communities. Hence you'll find *different* features, such as a democratic moderation system that enables the most trusted members to lead the community. Have a nice weekend! Iroquote does look like a unique take on the forum structure. It has my interest and I'll be following it's development. Thanks for the heads up! Maybe you should use this for the link to Vanilla:  http://vanillaforums.org/ It should be mentioned that Discourse is open source (GPL). Time for MUO to embedded one of the above mentioned forum software in there website. I still prefer the good old PHPBB. I'm with you there. Simple Machines is alright too, but I'd love for there to better spam control. Less intrusion with mutilple verification methods and quicker login. I know, I'm dreaming. NO deletes? Good grief! Surely that's an April 1 joke? You mean there's no way to delete hate speech, racism, libel, blatant advertising and, um, "adult" content? I remember a forum like that. It encouraged the worst in people. Fortunately, it died. Oh well, I suppose that policy would save on having to pay moderators. :) Well, I am sure that they might have a 'Report' feature. Also, today, many (successful) forums too are having moderators volunteering for free. So, that theory can be ruled out. FYI, MUO doesn't have any such thing as well. You can't edit or delete your posts, whatever content it might have. Anyways, the post is great and an eye-opener for me. I am just going to start a forum and was considering the "ol'" MyBB for that. But after seeing them, I am thinking of moving to one of the three services. I can handle some coding. Some of my requirements for my forum are as follows: 1. I am looking forward to make an invite-only forum. (MyBB had a few plugins regarding the same, but were big-time buggy and unupdated since months or even years!) 2. Hosting it myself is what I'd prefer more. (eliminates Moot. Handling MyBB can be sometimes a pain in the butt.) 3. High level of security is a top priority. (MyBB is not updated quite regularly) 4. The more flexiblity in customizing while not sacrificing ease-to-use is what I'd prefer. (Admin CP of MyBB is quite a mess! No offences.) 5. Last but not the least, transfering process from MyBB should be comfortable (only transfering the threads, users and their posts). Please do tell what among the remaining two would suffice. Vanilla kind of looks better, but I can't say much as I haven't checked more about both of them yet. I can't see my previous post visible yet, but just saw more about Vanilla, and it is not free! So bad! Vanilla is indeed free. Make sure you visit .org instead of .com (which is the hosting service for Vanilla). Oops! Well, that's like WordPress! Anyways, Vanilla's great, but has very less plugins even after years of its inception. Also, it doesn't support thread-like conversations. Anyways, it's a great place to get started. I prefer Beehive forum software.       Joel Lee has a B.S. in Computer Science and over six years of professional writing experience.
