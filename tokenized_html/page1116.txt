velvet vanity libra baby liquid matte lipstick swatches review aishah jaffar if you re not selling liquid lipsticks do you even exist a friend of mine retweeted someone saying that a while back and i couldn t help but to chuckle we ve seen a plethora of liquid lipsticks emerge from our local scene in the past year and while i am proud to see home-grown brands i feel that maybe most of them just resort to using the same manufacturer supplier to buy in bulk and then just slap a label on it i could be wrong but that s just the pessimist in me talking velvet vanity is one of our local brands that is fast becoming a favourite among the cool kids this is one local cosmetics company that i was excited to try out with a following of 22k on instagram they ve certainly taken the world of liquid lipsticks in malaysia by storm they ve managed to break into the international market too with vendors in singapore and indonesia i love the fact that they have a proper website as i am not keen on most insta-shops to be honest i want to be able to browse at whatever products you re selling with the price listed and being able to buy it with a few clicks they started out by introducing three colours at rm59 a pop slamberry blood wasted and libra baby all of which were sold out at one point it s quite a steep price if you think about it because you can get colourpop for rm30 only i snagged libra baby during their clearance sale a couple of months back i was hoping to get slamberry but it was sold out unfortunately at first glance libra baby looks like a peach-pink nude shade that was what it looked like swatched on my hand however when i applied it onto my lips it looked a little bit strange to me it somehow appeared like a fluorescent nudey-pink if that s even possible hahaha when i looked into the mirror the colour made it look like i turned my lips inside out i don t know how to explain it but that is honestly how i felt it made me look maybe the shade was too close of a match to the inside of my lips hahaha i thought that perhaps the colour just wasn t complementing my skin-tone but two of my friends felt the same about libra baby i was really hoping to love the colour because everyone else that i ve seen wearing it looks amazing formula-wise it is reminiscent to nyx s soft matte lip cream it had that light mousse texture which is very comfortable on the lips and definitely feels smooth and a bit slippy for a matte liquid lipstick it didn t dry super matte like colourpop s ultra matte lip it didn t last very long either it fades and transfers with eating and drinking much like nyx s smlc so touching up is a given they ve recently launched a new collection stuck in the 90s with two new shades cheap thrills and mr west along with that they introduced a new packaging as well and they look so cute i don t know if they ve tweaked the formula but the colours are calling my name and i would get one for myself if i wasn t on a no-buy diet all in all i have to give it up to the gals behind velvet vanity they created a brand and image that could potentially rival international brands and i am proud to see them growing this far i hope to see them expand and take on the cosmetics scene to infinity and beyond have you tried velvet vanity what did you think about it i don t even know how long it s been since i bought and used this colourpop ultra matte lip but i am finally posting this swatch and review ever since liquid lipsticks boomed in the last year i have been dying to get my hands on one to try it out for… in beauty whenever this sale pops up you can bet that your s truly will take advantage of it i mean 20 off who does t want that mind you this sale happened aeons ago probably sometime during april or may i can t recall i ve just gotten around to take some photos… in beauty if you want to know all about the storage i used for my makeup collection check this out if you want to see what i have in my face/base collection check this out let s get on with part 3 today shall we i have to say that this is my… in beauty your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name email website notify me of new comments via email notify me of new posts via email so good to know local indie makeup is slowly thriving like like welcome to my little corner of the internet stay a while and rummage around maybe you 'll find something helpful enter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email follow there was an error retrieving images from instagram an attempt will be remade in a few minutes view full site create a free website or blog at wordpress.com
