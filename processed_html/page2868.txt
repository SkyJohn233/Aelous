Directions:  Apply to face and neck after cleansing and before moisturizing, using a cotton pad. Packaging:  It comes in a lightweight, clear, plastic bottle with a flip-top cap. The cap shuts tightly and prevents the product from leaking while travelling. The cap has a small opening through which the product can be poured out. I really wish this came in a spray bottle since then it would be easier to control the amount of product dispensed. Since the bottle is transparent, it is easy to determine how much product is left. A smaller 60ml bottle is also available but it cannot be purchased separately and is part of a skincare kit that contains a face wash, toner, day cream and night lotion. Fragrance:  This is what I love the most about this toner! While most toners smells either too herbal or too alcoholic, this one smells DIVINE :heart: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s has an aquatic  fragrance  and is sooo refreshing. Color  &  Consistency:  It is a colorless liquid and has both the color and consistency of plain water. It looks so pure and I love that there is no added color. It feels soothing to just look at it ðŸ˜› IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been hunting high and low for a toner that does not contain alcohol yet manages to remove residual dirt and tone my oily skin without drying it out. It seemed like a lot of high expectations but this toner caters to ALL my demands! :yippee: It removes grease, grime and any residual  cleanser  very effectively. In fact, when I feel I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to over-wash my face, I just pour some of this toner onto a cotton pad and swipe away until my skin is clean. It does not leave skin feeling tight or stretched. In fact, skin feels moisturized and supple. Those with very oily skin may find that their skin feels mildly sticky post application but nothing too bothersome. Since I have oily skin, I can easily skip moisturizer when I use this and directly apply my BB cream or foundation. It does not ever sting or burn even when used on irritated skin or around the eyes. I was totally in love with this and had already decided that this was my HG toner untilÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ something strange happened. The weather here is INSANLEY hot and it must be the reason why my crystal-clear toner turned cloudy white! :pain: I was in shock and looked up online but no one seemed to have faced a similar issue. ðŸ˜¥ My husband suggested that I dump the entire contents (and I hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t used up even quarter of the bottle :struggle:) and bid adieu to my love. But I was like Noooo :stop: IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d already checked the manufacturing and expiry dates and knew the product was otherwise fresh. Not wanting to give it up that easily, I warily began to use it to see if it would react with my acne-prone skin. :nerd: Sometimes, products infused with natural ingredients do tend to change color without having `an impact on the potency of the ingredients. Thankfully, the change in color had in no way affected the efficacy of the product. Phew! :sweat: Aaaaand once I got back home (where the weather is MUCH cooler) the toner turned clear again! :yippee: It turned cloudy white again when I went to a hotter place and turned clear again when kept in the frigde. :-/ Yes, the color kept yo-yo-ing back and forth but it worked equally well at all times. So allÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s well that ends well :cute: The image on the right show the crystal-clear toner while the image on the left depict the color-change due to rise in temperature. Rating: 4.8/5 Final thoughts:  This is a super-nice, moisturizing  toner  that is best suited for combination to  oily skin . Those with dry skin can use this in summer since it is not at all drying and wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave skin feeling stretched. Those with oily skin will love it in winters, and in summers will need to follow up with a mattifying moisturizer or powder to combat the mild stickiness this leaves behind in humid weather. It smells divine and lifts grease and grime with ease. Despite the fact that mine very strangely turned cloudy and then changed back, I still love this toner and wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind repurchasing :cute: You might also like reading these:- I have used and loved the Seaweed CTM Kit The toner is pretty good ðŸ™‚ Lovely review dear  < 3 Thank u so much Saniya ðŸ™‚ Am surely picking up the whole kit on my next visit :-)) Nice and fun review Nafisa ðŸ™‚ N u have a  color-changing  magical toner ðŸ˜‰ lol!
