These tiny buildings are created specifically for the environment that they are in. Every design decision has been made to either enhance the experience of the surroundings or shield from it. The purpose of the cabins is to let the people staying in them come close to nature but in a comfortable way. All cabins are completely off the grid and located on a private island. Simplicity was a necessity – from a construction point of view but also to keep the balance between building and nature.   The timber structure is made from the same kind of trees that grows around it – Norway spruce. Pillars lift the floor up from the ground as a sign of respect for nature – thus the footprint of this building is minimal.
