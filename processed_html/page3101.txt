Build a Cordova app with AngularJS - Damien Antipa GitHub Twitter Jan 5 th , 2014                    |  Comments Initially I used to develop my iOS applications natively in Objective C. However since I am not doing that on a daily basis, I kind of lost track of newer features and got tired searching through the API to make my way. Luckily I am working with web technology on a daily basis and even more luckily there is  Apache Cordova  (former  Phonegap ) for quite a while around. To bootstrap my new application I quickly started to look around what framework would be best to use. My choice was  AngularJS , for no particular reason other then that I wanted to try how it will work on Cordova. I will give you a step by step guidance how to set up the environment and bootstrap a new application for Cordova. I will do that with AngularJS and  Yeoman  though all of this steps can easily done for Ember, Backbone etc. Just use the appropriate  Yeoman Generator  to use a different framework. The node package manager will help us to install Cordova globally through the shell as well as Yeoman On Mac OSX and Unix you have to execute this with root permissions. Yeoman will also install  Grunt  and  Bower  for you. Now you are ready to create a new cordova project, simply navigate to your workspace folder and execute This will create your new Cordova app under /kitchensink. You should see a structure like that For your development you will mainly focus what goes under  www  and  platforms . Let s start adding target platforms. I would like to have my KitchenSinkApp on iOS and Android. Addtionally I would like to add the  Compass plugin  to my project. Eventually the project is ready to be combined with the web application. We create a new folder in the project and let Yeoman bootstrap an AngularJS app for us. Follow the dialog to create a new Angular project structure and have a look at the  Angular Generator , it provides you plenty of useful commands to add views, controllers, services etc. I recommend you not to directly create an Angular project in the /www folder even though it would work. Having all depending node modules in there will cause a massive application size and takes lots of compiling time. To build The Angular project use the Grunt configuration given by Yeoman. This will generate a build output in your webapp folder under /dist. In order to integrate the files into your Cordova project you will either need to copy the contents of this folder to /www. You may do that manually, change the grunt script or build a shell script, I leave that up to you. Now navigate back to your Cordova app and execute the build command to create or update the project. That s it. All your different builds are available under /platforms   Copyright   2014 - Damien Antipa. Powered by  Octopress
