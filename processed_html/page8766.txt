Jeffrey Decker arrested again in his latest run-in with UW System By  Patrick Marley  of the  Journal Sentinel Madison   The son of a former state senator was thrown in jail over the weekend for violating a harassment injunction that the Court of Appeals overturned nearly a year ago. The Saturday arrest of Jeffrey Decker is the latest twist in his  long battle with the University of Wisconsin System . His two-night stint in jail comes as the state Supreme Court considers the validity of the restraining order at the heart of his legal fight. Decker   the son of former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Russ Decker   has long protested the use of student fees, often wearing a  homemade dragon costume  or in other colorful ways. He graduated from UW-Stevens Point in 2005 and re-enrolled there in 2010 so he had a better means of raising concerns about student fees. After a tense meeting that fall with the school's chancellor, he was suspended, which included an automatic ban from all UW System campuses. The UW System argues Decker is a threat, which he calls ridiculous. Despite the ban, Decker continued to visit campuses. The UW System took him to court and a Dane County judge issued a harassment injunction against Decker in October 2011 that barred him from UW property for four years and prohibited him from possessing firearms. This January, the Court of Appeals  ruled  Decker's appearances on campus were legitimate protests and thus did not qualify as harassment. The Supreme Court agreed to take the  case  and is expected to rule by next summer. The UW System and the state Department of Justice maintain the injunction remains in effect   even though it was overturned   because the state had quickly asked the Supreme Court to review the matter and the Court of Appeals decision was never sent back to the circuit judge who issued the injunction. Police continue to enforce the injunction   most recently on Saturday. " It's clearly designed to suppress free speech, "  Decker said of the state's interpretation of the state of the injunction. Decker said he attended a UW-Stevens Point function to raise concerns about how the United Council of UW Students is spending fees. Police were called and arrested Decker. He spent two nights in jail and was released Monday after a hearing,  online court records show . Portage County District Attorney Louis Molepske Jr. said he planned to charge Decker with disorderly conduct and bail jumping and likely would charge him with violating the injunction as well. Even if the injunction is no longer valid, Decker will still be charged because his bond in cases from other counties required him not to visit UW property, Molepske said. Those cases stem from other incidents in which Decker visited campuses. Decker disputed he had acted disorderly Saturday. But he acknowledged he let those nearby know about his concerns when police showed up. " Being surrounded by police does not silence an American, "  he said.
