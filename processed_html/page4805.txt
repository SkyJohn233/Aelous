Students fail to recognize plagiarism | UWire Posted on April 1, 2010 ><span class="singletags">< span> By Collin Eaton Each semester, one U. Texas chemistry lecturer has at least 50  students in his or her classes who are unknowingly guilty of cheating  when they use old information gleaned from online sources to answer  exam, textbook or homework questions. Chemistry lecturer Conrad Fjetland said most of these students — who  use Web sites like CourseHero.com, a “social learning network” — do not  understand that using these materials is considered plagiarism. Course  Hero and similar sites provide students with specific course information  compiled from real classes and assignments. Its Facebook page currently  has 265,415 fans. “Using these sites as study aids is one thing, but when you go there  specifically to find answers, that’s when you’ve crossed the line,” he  said. “Some students don’t really specifically understand what  plagiarism is. That’s the most common [example of cheating] I see. I  basically tell the students that if you go to these sites and you look  at this report, you have officially cheated in the course.” In 2008-09, there were 1,089 reported academic and non-academic  cases, which include disruptive classroom behavior and cheating. Of  those cases, 421 resulted from academic dishonesty, which includes  plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration. Faculty members who are  unable to resolve issues with a particular student can send the case to  the office’s Student Judicial Services, a body that can either hold a  hearing to determine disciplinary action or give an administrative  disposition in which a student agrees with the charges and waives his or  her right to a hearing. Of the reported academic dishonesty cases, 186  were referred to judicial services in the 2008-2009 year, but only seven  students were suspended from UT for academic dishonesty. Rutgers University management and global business professor Donald  McCabe, whose expertise includes college cheating, said there is data to  support the assertion that engineering students cut corners more often  than liberal arts students. McCabe said engineering students use  solution manuals to solve problems in their textbooks to manage their  time more effectively. “They’ll particularly do that in courses where they feel they know  the material and where there is really no learning value and it’s just  busy work, as far as they’re concerned,” McCabe said. “I’m sure [using  the solution manual] starts as just busy work, but it becomes a habit. I  think they’ve convinced themselves, for whatever reason, that it’s not  cheating.” According to a 2002 report by Stanford University computer science  professor Eric Roberts, computer science students have made up the  largest portion of any Stanford college in academic violations of the  Stanford honor code since 1990. One of the reasons cheating is so  prevalent in computer science is that computer homework assignments are  re-used from year to year to work out bugs. The risk of this method is  that students can easily access past assignments. Tracy Mitrano, director of IT Policy, Computer Policy and Law  Programs at Cornell, said the information available to a student far  surpasses that of 20 years ago and that it’s easy to just copy  information to complete a homework requirement. “The availability of the information and the social norms of how  people are using it have changed in such a way that we’re crossing a  line into cheating and plagiarism,” Mitrano said. She said the most important step universities can take is to educate  their students about the pitfalls of the information age. “Too much has changed that we haven’t kept up with,” she said. “We  can’t assume now that if we just say, ‘By the way, everyone is subject  to the academic integrity [honor] code,’ that everyone really knows what  that means. We really have to talk about how students study, how they  use information technology and what the expectation is for original  thought on a paper or a problem set.” Read more here:  http://dailytexanonline.com/content/students-fail-recognize-plagiarism >Copyright 2019 Daily Texan< p>                                 Copyright Privacy Contact FAQ Blog Affiliates About UWire  2019 Uloop Inc. /*   */ /*   */
