I know about the vortech system that capa provides but I have heard alot of negative feedback that the respose is crap and that it isnt of any good.. so I was wondering if anyone knows of places in perth where they sell superchargers or kits if available for the fg n/a? These kits make sense to me where no forced induction options are available stock but for the 6K plus it takes to get one of these kits running right I am sure you could sell your N/A and buy a turbo version have a more reliable and higher power with better resale  All for doing things differently to the pack but sometimes the economics just mean that very few people are going to do it and lack of research means it is going to be a hard road and not worth the small extra output these kits nett you mate you will always get the same response on here-  for the dollars it will cost you to get mediocre performance from a supercharger added, you could trade up to a turbo version. See what we can learn on this one. but superchargers are what they put on  v8s and v8s do sik skids yuleh!!
