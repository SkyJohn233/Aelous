a magnificent one today we have an email from candace who lives in long beach california who asks pastor john what does the bible say or what are your thoughts about the practice of using the bible to swear truthfulness in a court of law why is this done should it be and what about those who lie is this act using a bible make the lie more punishable in god s eyes to be honest right up front i think christians should resist taking such oaths in that traditional way and by that traditional way i mean — and this is part of my answer to her question about the meaning of it — taking a sacred object and swearing to tell the truth by that sacred object like a bible or your mother s name or your father s grave or the name of god or christ like i swear by my father s grave i won t lie to you. something like that in this traditional way of taking an oath about calling some sacred object to mind the idea is that your commitment to truth may be weak and would be strengthened by the desire not to desecrate the sacred object you have sworn by do you see that in other words the assumption is that you come into this courtroom or some situation and you are not really committed to tell the truth so maybe we could up your commitment to tell the truth if we could get you to associate your telling of the truth or your lying with the desecration of some sacred object like your mother s name or dad s grave or the name of god or the bible so that is why i think the bible was traditionally used in court because it was once upon a time a universally held treasure of holiness in the culture that no one but the most hardened person would want to desecrate by swearing by it and then lying through his teeth right after he had put his hand on the bible that he is now desecrating and the reason i want to discourage christians from taking that kind of oath is because here is what jesus said in matthew 5:33–37 again you have heard that it was said to those of old you shall not swear falsely but shall perform to the lord what you have sworn. but i say to you do not take an oath at all either by heaven for it is the throne of god or by the earth for it is his footstool or by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king and do not take an oath by your head for you can not make one hair white or black let what you say be simply yes or no anything more than this comes from evil and then james picks it up above all my brothers — which is quite a statement — do not swear either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath let your yes be yes and your no be no so that you may not fall under condemnation james 5:12 now as soon as those verses are quoted like that usually it is pointed out from the other side well wait a minute god himself took an oath in hebrews 6:13–18 and angels take oaths revelation 10:5–7 and paul at least five times heightened his seriousness in telling this truth by saying he was speaking in the presence of god or christ see for example romans 9:1–2 now my response to that is to say yes that is important to take into consideration but none of those examples as far as i can tell diminishes the seriousness or applicability of jesus s words in matthew 5:33–37 or james s words in james 5:12 the burden of jesus is that his people be so utterly and deeply and simply committed to tell the truth that they don t need buttresses to hold up their words like the fear of desecrating a sacred object or whatever in fact jesus says that if you add to yes or no it is likely that this is coming from evil so very practically here is what i have thought i would do i have never been a witness in a courtroom not yet but here is what i thought i would do if i ever was deposed by lawyers or sworn in as they say in a courtroom as a witness so they present me with a bible maybe hold out your hand. i don t know how the different courts are doing it these days if they presented me with a bible and asked me to put my hand on it and swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth i would say something like this your honor my commitment to the truth and to the lord of the truth jesus christ leads me to believe that it would dishonor both my commitment to the lord and the lord himself if i needed to put my hand on this sacred book to guarantee my truthfulness i am totally committed to the truth and to the lord of the truth so i ask that i be permitted to act without such an oath but i do promise in reliance on the help of the lord jesus to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth. and i think that courts would honor that promise i think they would allow you to say it your way and it is an occasion for testimony and i would use it if the lord gave me grace so the point of that little action right there in the courtroom is to magnify jesus as the lord of truth and to highlight my commitment to be a person of the truth without any need for threats that my dishonesty would bring worse consequences because i put my hand on the bible find other recent and popular ask pastor john episodes apj series icon share twitter facebook email filled audio share twitter facebook email filled share twitter
