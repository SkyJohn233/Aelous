and colleagues learn more share a link increasing human pressure on strongly defaunated ecosystems is characteristic of the anthropocene and calls for proactive restoration approaches that promote self‐sustaining functioning ecosystems however the suitability of novel restoration concepts such as trophic rewilding is still under discussion given fragmentary empirical data and limited theory development here we develop a theoretical framework that integrates the concept of ecological memory into trophic rewilding the ecological memory of an ecosystem is defined as an ecosystem 's accumulated abiotic and biotic material and information legacies from past dynamics by summarising existing knowledge about the ecological effects of megafauna extinction and rewilding across a large range of spatial and temporal scales we identify two key drivers of ecosystem responses to trophic rewilding i impact potential of re introduced megafauna and ii ecological memory characterising the focal ecosystem the impact potential of re introduced megafauna species can be estimated from species properties such as lifetime per capita engineering capacity population density home range size and niche overlap with resident species the importance of ecological memory characterising the focal ecosystem depends on i the absolute time since megafauna loss ii the speed of abiotic and biotic turnover iii the strength of species interactions characterising the focal ecosystem and iv the compensatory capacity of surrounding source ecosystems these properties related to the focal and surrounding ecosystems mediate material and information legacies its ecological memory and modulate the net ecosystem impact of re introduced megafauna species we provide practical advice about how to quantify all these properties while highlighting the strong link between ecological memory and historically contingent ecosystem trajectories with this newly established ecological memory–rewilding framework we hope to guide future empirical studies that investigate the ecological effects of trophic rewilding and other ecosystem‐restoration approaches the proposed integrated conceptual framework should also assist managers and decision makers to anticipate the possible trajectories of ecosystem dynamics after restoration actions and to weigh plausible alternatives this will help practitioners to develop adaptive management strategies for trophic rewilding that could facilitate sustainable management of functioning ecosystems in an increasingly human‐dominated world facing globally pervasive human impacts on ecosystems nature managers are increasingly moving their focus away from traditional attitudes of preservation towards proactive restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem services suding gross houseman 2004 sandom et al. 2013a kollmann et al. 2016 rewilding is one of these alternative approaches that has gained strong scientific and public interest in recent years jepson 2016 svenning et al. 2016 fernández navarro pereira 2017 although the term rewilding has a complex history and is related to a variety of different concepts and land‐management practices see lorimer et al. 2015 and jørgensen 2016 for further details it can be generally defined as an ecological restoration approach that aims to promote self‐sustaining ecosystem functioning sandom et al. 2013a svenning et al. 2016 fernández et al. 2017 rewilding concentrates on restoring natural processes sandom et al. 2013a smit et al. 2015 in contrast to most conventional approaches of nature management which often focus on the conservation of single species or specific ecosystem states rewilding also tries to reach the predetermined restoration goal of self‐sustaining ecosystems by keeping human intervention to a minimum svenning et al. 2016 fernández et al. 2017 a clear difference from the majority of classical nature restoration approaches that are characterised by a high degree of ongoing management ecosystems are often at least partially shaped by top‐down trophic effects provided by animals these top‐down trophic interactions have to be rehabilitated in order to facilitate self‐sustaining biodiverse ecosystems the re‐ establishment of missing often large‐bodied herbivores and carnivores can achieve this this is a key aspect of trophic rewilding defined as species introductions to restore top‐down trophic interactions and associated trophic cascades to promote self‐regulating biodiverse ecosystems svenning et al. 2016 the re‐ establishment of large‐sized animals may thus occur by active re introduction as a form of active rewilding but can also occur by species spontaneously recolonising regions from which they have been formerly extirpated e.g wolves and beavers in central europe the latter falls under the wider concept of passive rewilding navarro pereira 2012 svenning et al. 2016 and could be referred to as passive trophic rewilding there may also be intermediate cases where re‐establishment is actively promoted without direct translocation of animals in all cases large‐bodied animals megafauna are assumed to have disproportionally large and beneficial effects on the biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems malhi et al. 2016 smith et al. 2016 fernández et al. 2017 and all are considered in our discussion of trophic rewilding below if necessary rewilding of large‐bodied herbivores can be complemented with the re introduction of predators when potential negative effects of herbivore re introduction e.g high herbivore pressure are likely to occur without effective top‐down control when herbivore regulation is necessary but control by large carnivores is not effective e.g for herbivores that are too big for top‐down regulation or not feasible e.g in heavily populated urban environments or when rewilding sites are too small to sustain carnivores active regulation of herbivore densities might be a necessary management strategy complementing rewilding traditionally megafauna refers to animals with a body mass of ≥45 kg martin 1973 although this threshold in absolute size is arbitrary herein we use a more flexible relative definition of megafauna as the largest animal species in a given ecological community or guild hansen galetti 2009 this is likely more ecologically meaningful especially when comparing ecosystems with different degrees of isolation e.g mainland versus islands rewilding especially active rewilding is the subject of active scientific and public debate which sometimes moves beyond our current scientific understanding and is often based more on opinion than facts sandom hughes macdonald 2013b there is much discussion about the potential socio‐economic consequences and conflicts emerging from rewilding for further details see e.g bauer wallner hunziker 2009 but the ecological consequences of re introducing large animals are also controversial especially relating to when and where the introduction of megafauna might be beneficial or practical malhi et al. 2016 the absence of scientific monitoring for most existing rewilding projects a general problem for conservation and restoration leads to ambiguous conclusions about the effects of rewilding on the functioning and service provisioning of ecosystems this engenders criticism over the generalisation of positive effects and widespread implementation of trophic rewilding the lack of practical experience as well as theoretical and empirical understanding about ecosystem responses to megafauna re introduction svenning et al. 2016 may increase negative views of rewilding to maximise the benefits and reduce potential ecological risks linked to trophic rewilding we need a thorough understanding of the complex role of megafauna in ecosystem functioning smith et al. 2016 case studies e.g yellowstone national park are often highly debated in the scientific literature and reveal complex responses to the reintroduction of megafauna due to the multitude of interactions and feedbacks that characterise ecosystems beschta ripple 2012 dobson 2014 here we argue that for trophic rewilding as well as for any other restoration approach the history of an ecosystem is a key factor to consider for planning and implementation see chazdon 2008 and crouzeilles et al. 2016 for forest restoration the importance of ecosystem history for rewilding projects is rarely recognised and insufficiently conceptualised in the current literature navarro pereira 2012 sherkow greely 2013 smit et al. 2015 nogués‐bravo et al. 2016 svenning et al. 2016 the benefits risks and costs of trophic rewilding must be evaluated by integrating our recent understanding of ecosystem dynamics to ensure a scientifically sound implementation of this proactive restoration approach fernández et al. 2017 however empirical research is fragmentary and theoretical frameworks to guide empirical studies on the role of ecosystem history for trophic rewilding are missing malhi et al. 2016 svenning et al. 2016 here we propose a conceptual framework that could be used to establish a scientifically sound basis for future management and decision‐making about trophic rewilding it furthermore can provide guidelines for future studies on the ecological effects of nature restoration practices like trophic rewilding we frame current perspectives on trophic rewilding into existing theoretical concepts related to ecological memory the ecological memory of a specific ecosystem is here defined as an ecosystem 's accumulated abiotic and biotic material and information legacies from past dynamics nystroem folke 2001 folke 2006 detailed specifications of these legacies are discussed below we first provide a summary of the current theoretical understanding of ecological memory and integrate these concepts into the framework of trophic rewilding we then relate existing observations about the ecological effects of megafauna extinction and rewilding to ecological memory these illustrative examples aim at covering a large range of spatial and temporal scales although our considerations and examples are focused on practices related to trophic rewilding of large‐bodied extant animals our theoretical framework is general enough to be easily adapted to other forms of rewilding e.g passive rewilding gillson laddle araújo 2011 or ecosystem restoration understanding the history of ecosystems is a prerequisite when planning restoration activities like trophic rewilding that aims for sustainable maintenance of biodiverse functional ecosystems landres morgan swanson 1999 smith et al. 2016 svenning et al. 2016 most attributes observable in current ecosystems e.g landscape and vegetation structure species composition and diversity food‐web topography are contingent on historical influences just as future system attributes will be contingent on current conditions affected by current land use and restoration activities landres et al. 1999 this contingency is conceptualised in the idea of ecological memory which focusses on abiotic and biotic material and information legacies within ecosystems fig 1 and table 1 these legacies are represented by observable attributes of current ecosystems such as remnant populations or diaspores of locally extinct species behavioural or morphological adaptations to lost ecological interactions or even landscape characteristics e.g peterson 2002 schäfer 2011 johnstone et al. 2016 blackhall et al. 2017 genes et al. 2017 since these observable quasi‐static attributes result from long‐term ecosystem dynamics the ecological memory concept is relevant for investigating the effects of an ecosystem 's history on its response to changes such as the re introduction of megafauna padisák 1992 peterson 2002 each component of ecological memory affects ecosystem responses at different temporal spatial and organisational scales fig 1 in the following sections we distinguish internal components of ecological memory that act within the focal rewilding ecosystem and external components that are present in the surrounding environment table 1 schäfer 2009 the internal components of ecological memory are inherent to the focal rewilding ecosystem they are either material legacies represented by observable attributes e.g wood stems diaspores etc. or information legacies represented by attributes such as species behavioural morphological or genetic traits many of these legacies result from past biotic dynamics e.g species interactions with now extirpated species or past abiotic environmental conditions the internal components of ecological memory can act on the landscape community and intraspecific scales table 1 whereas material legacies generally predominate at the landscape scale information legacies gain in importance at the community scale and dominate at the intraspecific scale information legacies acting at the landscape scale are generally underrepresented but can be revealed for instance by the structure topology of ecological networks landscape‐scale material legacies are represented by structural attributes like terrain complexity soil properties etc. which result from past geomorphodynamic and biological processes like denudation and biotic weathering soil formation by soil biota e.g humification by arthropods and microbes and bioturbation this last process does not need to be limited to arthropods or small mammals an impressive example of megafaunal bioturbation is the large number 1500 of burrows scattered across the brazilian landscape that are tens of meters in length and 1.5–4 m in diameter probably resulting from the burrowing activity of extinct giant ground sloths and armadillos pereira lopes et al. 2017 material legacies can also be observed through the structural remains of past biological activities like woody stem fragments unpopulated termite mounds or specific vegetation structures resulting from past browsing or grazing activities schäfer 2011 blackhall et al. 2017 remnants of historical human land‐use such as dumps mines and habitat fragments e.g müller et al. 2017 must also be considered as material legacies all these material legacies are likely to influence the response of ecosystems to megafauna re introduction an example is the topography‐related heterogeneous habitat use of red deer cervus elaphus recolonising a former brown‐coal mining area in denmark müller et al. 2017 in this case landscape structures are mostly the result of past human land use i.e human‐generated topography additional examples of such anthropogenic components of ecological memory are presented by moore et al 2015 who showed that the spatial availability of preferred foraging vegetation as a result of human land use affects the overall grazing behaviour of red deer in the landscape another example is provided by schippers et al 2014 who report that anthropogenic forest fragmentation can affect the habitat use and browsing pressure of large herbivores in landscapes such anthropogenic components of ecological memory are of particular relevance in ecosystems with a long history of human land use e.g normand et al. 2017 internal ecological memory components at the community scale result from past species distributions compositions and interactions across space nystroem folke 2001 material legacies can be represented by viable remnants of locally extinct species e.g tests spores seeds or remnant populations of long‐lived species schäfer 2009 johnstone et al. 2016 lost populations can be re‐established from such viable remnants like soil seedbanks for plants if conditions become suitable again navarro pereira 2012 compared to material legacies information legacies are probably the dominant component of ecological memory at the community scale table 1 these information legacies can be represented by species behavioural physiological or morphological traits affecting the responses of resident species to the re introduction of large‐bodied animals in trophic rewilding examples of such observable attributes are anachronistic fruit characteristics as a result of historical co‐evolution with currently extinct frugivorous mammals janzen martin 1982 or defensive traits e.g spinescence and resprouting behaviour of woody plants reflecting adaptations to now extinct native herbivores göldel et al. 2016 blackhall et al. 2017 all these legacies can strongly interact with the re introduction of megafauna empirical evidence is provided by e.g milchunas lauenroth 1993 who report the effect of introduced grazers on plant community composition to be strongly affected by the ecosystems evolutionary history of grazing with changes in species composition increasing with a longer history of more intense co‐evolution historically established interaction links which are currently lost can be reactivated by restoration activities and are of major importance when planning rewilding activities genes et al. 2017 these include antagonistic links e.g consumer–resource relationships as well as mutualistic links conversely legacies that imply the absence of interactions in the past can also strongly interact with faunal introduction for example naïve prey on islands have not evolved fear because of a history without predators ecological networks involving such naïve prey species show strong changes after the introduction of predators like weasels martens or rats traveset richardson 2006 all these information legacies acting at the community scale are nevertheless dependent on the species present to rewire the lost interactions and thus can not be seen as independent from the material legacies acting at the community scale ecological memory on an intraspecific scale results from species genetic adaptations to the past abiotic environment and past biotic interactions it is predominated by information legacies within one species or even within a single organism genetic diversity phenotypic plasticity and local adaptations within species or populations might be examples of observable attributes revealing these intraspecific information legacies and affecting the response of individuals within one species to rewilding additional intraspecific information legacies might result from maternal effects i.e the causal influence of the maternal genotype or phenotype on the offspring phenotype that mediate offspring response to environmental change galloway 2005 wolf wade 2009 dyer et al. 2010 heger 2016 ren et al. 2017 these legacies are potentially relevant for mediating the response of resident species or populations to trophic rewilding besides the above‐mentioned internal components we must also consider the spatial context of a focal ecosystem to anticipate its response to rewilding the ecosystems surrounding the focal ecosystem form external components of ecological memory that act as potential sources for compensatory processes after disturbance such as the re introduction of megafauna nystroem folke 2001 golinski bauch arland 2008 schäfer 2009 2011 these external components predominate at the community scale as they provide genes as well as individuals or propagules for species recolonisation without the availability of source pools in the surrounding landscape it is often not possible to re‐establish extirpated species or to rewire lost interactions in the focal ecosystem suding et al. 2004 halffter et al. 2008 schäfer 2011 and re‐introductions might then have little effect for instance janzen 1983 demonstrated a long‐lasting lag in the recolonisation of costa rican ecosystems by dung beetles that co‐evolved with pleistocene megafauna due to missing source pools in the surrounding areas this occurred despite introductions of large‐bodied herbivores livestock cattle and horses that provided functionally similar dung compared to extinct megafauna halffter et al 2008 drew similar conclusions for the mexican dung beetle fauna they found that livestock brought by the spanish conquistadors partly compensated for the vacuum of suitable resources dung for the dung beetles that had co‐evolved with the extinct pleistocene megafauna however the authors argue that the mexican dung beetle communities are far from being saturated because of insufficient compensation from surrounding source areas faunal elements missing in the focal ecosystem additionally to the re introduced megafauna typically must be re‐established from source areas outside the target ecosystem thus relying on the external component of ecological memory besides species energy and material that flow between the focal and surrounding ecosystems must be considered as external components of ecological memory cf the meta‐ecosystem concept of loreau mouquet holt 2003 for instance the spatial configuration of habitat patches and soil properties of surrounding landscapes will influence the amount and type of matter that reaches a focal ecosystem where it interacts with the introduced fauna hansson 1991 dunning danielson pulliam 1992 table 1 although material legacies seem to predominate information legacies can play an important role in forming the external components of ecological memory information legacies can be represented for example by the genetic diversity of metapopulations within a landscape e.g pannell charlesworth 1999 for example dileo et al 2017 evaluated how the functional re‐connection of formerly isolated grassland fragments by rotational sheep herding influenced the metapopulation genetic structure of a rare grassland plant species in south germany they demonstrated that well‐connected plant populations had higher within‐population genetic diversity showed higher genetic similarity among different populations and had higher reproductive output compared to ungrazed or more isolated grazed populations this change in the genetic structure of local populations was only possible because genetic information was still stored in other habitat patches in the landscape ecological memory is usually considered in the context of disturbances that disrupt ecosystem integrity e.g schäfer 2009 blackhall et al. 2017 strong ecological memory is expected to enhance ecosystem capacity for reorganization after disturbances and environmental changes and prevents ecosystem shifts to alternative states by offering resources to recover ecosystem integrity gunderson 2000 carpenter et al. 2001 nystroem folke 2001 power et al. 2015 johnstone et al. 2016 this capability of ecosystems to absorb disturbances and avoid shifts to alternative states by system reorganisation is defined as ecological resilience gunderson holling 2002 carpenter folke 2006 folke 2006 in this context resilience can be seen as an emergent property of ecological memory high resilience however as a result of strong ecological memory can also impede restoration action such as trophic rewilding which aims at shifting an ecosystem from a less‐desirable current state to a new more desirable state folke 2006 gibbs et al. 2014 this janus‐faced effect of ecological memory on ecosystem resilience from a restoration ecology point of view has strong links to concepts of positive and negative resilience lake 2013 this is important to consider because megafauna especially herbivores can actively induce state shifts which might be desired under some circumstances e.g to reduce fire risk bowman 2012 an empirical example is provided by blackhall et al 2017 who showed that the introduction of large‐bodied herbivores to fire‐dominated systems changed the dominance relations between pyrophytic and pyrophobic woody plants altering the material legacy component of the systems resilience to fires however whether shifts to alternative states occur in response to megafauna re introduction strongly depends on the ecological memory related to the reintroduced megafauna or its functional counterparts with higher megafauna‐related memory e.g longer evolutionary history of grazing reducing the probability of state shifts as a consequence of megafauna re introduction cingolani noy‐meir díaz 2005 generally the capacity of ecosystems to adapt to environmental changes seems to be especially relevant in a human‐dominated dynamic world this is in line with the principle goal of trophic rewilding to build self‐sustaining biodiverse and functional ecosystems in changing environments svenning et al. 2016 by contrast a static reproduction of past ecosystem settings a common goal of classical ecological restoration will often not be desirable or feasible landres et al. 1999 suding et al. 2004 higgs et al. 2014 past interactions among species or between species and the environment play a crucial role in forming ecological memory the degree to which interactions evolved in the past between currently extinct megafauna and other species of plants or animals will influence the success of trophic rewilding projects empirical evidence for this argument is provided by favila 2012 who argues that dung beetles low dung‐processing efficiency of the dung of introduced large herbivores in australia compared to the relatively high efficiency of dung beetles in central and south america is caused by differences in the biogeography/ecological history of the dung beetle assemblages on both continents australian native dung beetles are not able to process dung of the new megafauna cattle horses and goats introduced by humans due to missing co‐evolution with functionally similar megafauna i.e missing information legacies probably in combination with massive losses of dung beetles around 40000 years ago in response to the near‐complete megafauna extinction by contrast native dung beetle assemblages of the americas closely co‐evolved during the neogene and pleistocene with palaearctic nearctic and neotropical megafauna horses camels bison that are functionally similar to present‐day human‐introduced livestock this scenario of megafauna species but also partly its interacting species going extinct gives rise to anachronisms janzen martin 1982 as well as extinction debts tilman et al. 1994 and credits of ecological interactions genes et al. 2017 such lagged responses to environmental changes e.g extinction of megafauna result in disequilibria between species abundance or absence in the focal ecosystem and current environmental conditions e.g absence of the particular megafauna species the presence of a disequilibrium or lag is an information legacy thus directly related to the ecological memory of a focal ecosystem a pronounced disequilibrium after megafauna extinction therefore represents a strong ecological memory in other words trophic rewilding projects are expected to be most successful and ecological interactions to stand the greatest chance of rewiring where large disequilibria or response lags to a past loss of megafauna are observed cf pires 2017 pronounced temporal lags in ecological responses are commonly found in remnant adaptations to prehistorical extinct megafauna these remnant adaptations are generally defined as ecological anachronisms galetti et al. 2018 and are assumed still to be prevalent e.g in temperate plant communities showing adaptations to extinct large‐bodied grazers bakker et al. 2004 in the foraging behaviour prey choice of neotropical large‐bodied predators jaguars still adapted to behavioural and morphological traits of extinct prey species hayward et al. 2016 and in overbuilt neotropical fruits still showing morphological adaptations to dispersal by extinct megafaunal frugivores janzen martin 1982 donatti et al. 2007 guimarães galetti jordano 2008 all these long‐lasting anachronisms illustrate that the underlying ecosystem responses are generally very slow and often result in large temporal lags and pronounced disequilibrium conditions such a slowly vanishing ecological memory is shown empirically by doughty et al 2016 who report reduced current range sizes of historically megafauna‐dispersed plants compared to other animal‐ but not megafauna‐dispersed plant species in the neotropics the speed of response to megafauna extinction and therefore the emergence of disequilibrium conditions should be determined by the speed of abiotic and biotic turnover e.g longevity of species hubbell 1980 and the strength of biotic interactions characterising the ecosystem donatti et al. 2007 this clearly links the concept of ecological memory to temporal lags and non‐equilibrium dynamics in ecosystems in the ecological memory–rewilding framework we propose that the impact potential of re introduced megafauna is mediated by the strength of ecological memory to affect rewilding outcomes fig 2 the impact potential of re introduced megafauna is defined as an ensemble of the animal 's behavioural morphological population and distributional properties that can have an impact on the focal ecosystem four different properties of the focal and surrounding ecosystems determine the strength of ecological memory which affects the focal ecosystem 's net response to rewilding by modulating the impact potential of the re introduced megafauna fig 2 three of these properties the absolute time since megafauna loss the speed of the turnover of abiotic and biotic components and the strength of species interactions are aspects of the focal ecosystem 's dynamics turnover is here defined as a continuous process of loss and replacement of energy matter or species which can decrease stabilise or increase energy matter or species composition in the focal ecosystem the fourth property determining the strength of ecological memory is the compensatory capacity of surrounding source ecosystems fig 2 the central element of the ecological memory–rewilding framework is the impact potential of megafauna species considered for rewilding fig 2 to assess this impact potential one must carefully consider the potential role of the considered megafauna species in the focal ecosystem barnosky et al. 2016 the idea of the ecological role of a species is found in the keystone species paine 1969 krebs 1985 and the ecosystem engineer concepts jones lawton shachak 1994 species are defined as ecosystem engineers when they actively modify abiotic environmental conditions resource availability ecosystem structure consequently modifying biotic interactions among co‐occurring species this differentiates ecosystem engineers from keystone species which are defined as species which have a disproportionately large effect on the ecological community relative to their abundance paine 1995 purely by biotic trophic interactions e.g predation coggan hayward gibb 2018 these two concepts are particularly relevant in the context of trophic rewilding when re introduced species are expected to have a strong impact on the ecosystem byers et al. 2006 svenning et al. 2016 the introduction of ecosystem engineering or keystone species is also important to promoting species diversity as both groups of species increase abiotic and biotic structural heterogeneity of ecosystems brunbjerg et al. 2017 a key driver of species diversity stein gerstner kreft 2014 the high relevance of ecosystem engineers to the restoration of ecosystems is already realised in the literature and by local managers ecosystem engineers can be seen as an efficient and comparably cheap management strategy to restore degraded ecosystems byers et al. 2006 large‐bodied animals are defined within the ecosystem engineering concept as allogenic engineers i.e species that change the environment by transforming living or non‐living materials from one physical state into another more generally the impact potential of this type of ecosystem engineer can be quantified as the magnitude to which they change the quality quantity and temporal and spatial distribution of abiotic and biotic resources available for other co‐occurring organisms jones et al. 1994 the greater the influence of ecosystem engineering megafauna on abiotic resources like the availability of water light nutrients etc. or on biotic resources like trees providing habitat or food the higher the impact potential of these ecosystem engineers on the biotic interactions in the focal ecosystem byers et al. 2006 the impact potential of a species reintroduced in the focal ecosystem is thereby affected by characteristics of the resident species such as the extent to which resident species can potentially exploit resources and modify the environment prior to the arrival of newcomers cf vannette fukami 2014 if resident species already have a strong impact on the resources and the environment large impact niche and use similar resources to the re introduced megafauna high niche overlap the impact potential of this added megafauna species is expected to be small two of the best‐recognised megafauna ecosystem engineers are elephants and beavers which may transform closed tree‐dominated systems to open grass‐dominated systems strongly modifying the abiotic and biotic resources available to co‐occurring species both elephants and beavers have high per capita engineering capacity and act over large spatial scales making their impact on ecosystem structure and functioning quite substantial furthermore both ecosystem engineers have long‐lasting effects on the structure and thus function of ecosystems as they are both long‐lived species compared to the slow regrowth of the trees they impact although such single megafauna species might sufficiently affect ecosystem structure the introduction of different species of megafauna affecting different resources to varying degrees provides a preferable management strategy for tackling complex restoration goals van der plas et al. 2016 the higher the impact potential of the re introduced megafauna on a target ecosystem the more carefully one has to understand its role in the focal system and the properties defining this role furthermore the strength of interaction between a species of megafauna considered for rewilding and the other resident species in the target ecosystem is related to the abundance of the re introduced species genes et al. 2017 thus species abundance is an important factor to consider when planning trophic rewilding projects following the ideas of the keystone species and ecosystem engineering concept we propose that four key properties need to be known in order to estimate the impact potential of candidate rewilding reintroduction species i the lifetime per capita engineering capacity ii the population density iii the home range size and iv the impact niche overlap between resident and introduced species figs 2 and 3 a species lifetime per capita engineering capacity depends on its longevity and its per‐individual activity information about the species life expectancy can be obtained relatively easily from demographic studies or proxies e.g tooth annuli found in the literature but per‐individual activity might be more difficult to quantify some examples of studies providing empirical estimates are the estimation of browsing activity of elephants the bioturbation activity of wild boars using high‐resolution imaging techniques lidar or multispectral cameras and plot‐based investigations to detect structural or compositional changes in vegetation fig 3 furthermore manipulative experiments varying the presence/absence or density of the rewilding candidate species might provide helpful insights regarding the potential ecosystem effects of rewilding coggan et al. 2018 this kind of experimental implementation of restoration activities seems to be especially suitable for rewilding projects which are generally planned to be open‐ended biggs rogers 2003 information about natural population densities are more challenging to acquire but can be obtained from field investigations or management literature or can be inferred from body‐size scaling relationships e.g pedersen faurby svenning 2017 finally information on home range size and impact niche overlap between the rewilding candidates and resident species can be obtained from field investigations or literature or can be estimated from body‐size scaling relationships e.g jetz et al. 2004 gravel et al. 2013 the time since extinction of a lost megafauna species is a key element affecting the strength of ecological memory related to this lost species in a focal ecosystem figs 2 and 3 with increasing time since extinction ecological memory related to the extinct megafauna species increasingly fades away see section ii .4 the fact that thousands of years have passed since the extinction of pleistocene megafauna is often used as a major argument against pleistocene rewilding e.g lorimer et al. 2015 it is however rarely valid due to the pronounced disequilibrium conditions and temporal response lags that characterise ecosystems see section ii .4 bakker et al. 2004 donatti et al. 2007 hayward et al. 2016 or because certain ecosystem states initially created by megafauna were maintained by traditional human land‐use activities for centuries after the loss of this megafauna bocherens 2018 species recently extirpated from the focal ecosystem are still proposed to be better candidates for reintroduction as the ecological memory information legacies related to these species is less likely to be lost and should potentially buffer against unwanted ecosystem responses sandom et al. 2013a we argue that the speed at which ecosystems developed in structure and dynamics is at least as important as the absolute time since extinction to determine the strength of ecological memory ecosystems must be seen as ephemeral open systems that are the outcome of broad‐scale dynamics in species ranges interacting with local environmental conditions and co‐occurring species ricklefs 2008 the assembly of ecosystems is thus determined by the adaptive interaction between dynamically changing pools of local and immigrating or introduced species and their abiotic environment higgins 2017 schweiger 2017 both are cumulatively reflected in the material and information legacies thus the ecological memory of an ecosystem we argue that the speed at which ecosystems assemble based on species–environment interactions is determined by abiotic and biotic turnover rates the slower the turnover rates are the more pronounced will be the temporal lags in species responses to megafauna extinction i.e the more likely the system will be in disequilibrium e.g by showing a high prevalence of anachronisms the slower the abiotic and biotic turnover characterising a focal ecosystem through its assembly is the greater the strength longevity of the ecological memory johnson et al. 2015 barnosky et al. 2016 the speed of abiotic and biotic turnover is strongly modulated by resource and energy availability the effects of megafauna extirpation on vegetation and related abiotic environmental conditions e.g microclimatic conditions carbon and nutrient cycling and pools etc have been reported by several studies to be mitigated under limiting environmental conditions like low rainfall low water availability barnosky et al. 2016 low temperature and low atmospheric co 2 concentration johnson et al. 2015 the speed of abiotic and biotic turnover thus modulates the impact potential and consequently the net ecosystem impact of the re introduced megafauna this relationship between resource/energy availability and megafauna impacts can be positive or negative depending on the characteristics of the introduced species and the property of the ecosystem that is impacted for instance plant species richness is reported by several studies to be decreased by grazing at low productivity but enhanced in high‐productivity systems proulx mazumder 1998 bakker et al. 2006 furthermore the magnitude of grazing effects on the composition richness and dominant species cover of plant communities was shown to increase significantly with productivity in south american steppes and grasslands lezama et al. 2014 based on a global data set milchunas lauenroth 1993 report a similar increase of grazing effects on plant species composition with increasing productivity but stress that an evolutionary history of grazing can diminish current grazing effects although effects of herbivorous megafauna on vegetation generally seem to decrease with decreasing resource and energy availability and thus productivity large‐sized herbivores can still have strong impacts on ecosystem functioning even in arctic ecosystems cahoon et al. 2012 a different picture seems to emerge if one looks at the effects of large mammal herbivores on the abundance of other consumers based on a meta‐analysis daskin pringle 2016 show that large mammal herbivores reduce the abundance of other consumers and that this effect is stronger in low‐productivity ecosystems probably due to slower plant re‐growth and higher relative uptake of forage vegetation by large herbivores ecological responses to megafauna reintroductions are thus linked to resource or energy availability productivity but with different responses at different trophic levels or response variables they can furthermore cascade down through numerous trophic levels of an ecosystem depending on the speed of turnover characterising the different interacting species we argue that the speed of such cascading responses depends on the speed of turnover characterising the consumer and resource species involved in an effect cascade this proposed mechanism is similar to the idea of how temporal lags in ecosystems accumulate essl et al. 2015 an example supporting this assumption is the extinction of the steller 's sea cow hydrodamalis gigas in the commander islands in the mid‐1700s provided by estes burdin doak 2016 who argued that the extinction of this large‐bodied marine mammal was the result of an effect cascade triggered by a population crash of sea otters enhydra lutris due to overhunting this reduction in sea otter numbers reduced the predation pressure on sea urchins which are major consumers of kelp as a result the population size of sea urchins and consequently herbivore pressure on kelp increased dramatically this resulted in a collapse of kelp forests the main food source for steller 's sea cow and led to the complete extinction of this marine megafaunal species after its prehistoric range had been strongly reduced by pre‐european hunting we argue that the speed at which the extinction of this large‐bodied animal took place is related to a cascade effect the negative feedback between rapid impacts and slow compensatory responses i.e responses tending towards a quasi‐equilibrium under given conditions and positive feedback between rapid impacts and fast responses led to an ecological chain reaction the human overhunting of otters represents a negative feedback between rapid impacts and slow responses as the relatively slowly reproducing otters were not able to compensate for culling by humans the rapidly increasing population size of sea urchins as a response to the decreasing otter population size represents a positive feedback between a rapid impact and a fast response the next two stages in the presented effect chain namely the rapid increase in herbivore pressure by increasing sea urchin populations on the kelp forests with slow compensatory regrowth as well as the subsequent potential negative effects on steller 's sea cow large‐bodied mammals with low reproductive rates highly specialized on kelp unable to switch to a new food source or increase their reproductive rates characterise negative feedbacks between a rapid impact and a slow response the reintroduction of large‐bodied animals can also induce effect chains cascading through the trophic levels of an ecosystem one popular example is the reintroduction of wolves canis lupus in yellowstone national park which have been reported to reduce herbivore pressure of american elk cervus elaphus on riparian woody vegetation subsequently changing river dynamics and related geomorphological processes at a landscape scale beschta ripple 2012 dobson 2014 the effect of the reintroduction of wolves on herbivore pressure is mainly indirect by affecting herbivore behaviour rather than directly killing herbivores creating a landscape of fear laundré hernández altendorf 2001 this represents another positive feedback between a rapid impact introduction of 20 wolves in the winter of 1994–1995 and fast direct and subsequent responses i.e a rapid decrease in browsing pressure on riparian woody vegetation by changing herbivore behaviour in combination with fast‐growing plant species populus spp and salix spp. however this direct link between wolf reintroduction herbivore pressure and recovery of riparian vegetation has been questioned by several studies and additional drivers interacting with the wolf reintroduction have been proposed i.e climate topography and human activities mech 2012 marshall cooper hobbs 2014 in general the diminished negative feedbacks caused by slow responses and the accelerated positive feedbacks caused by fast responses in effect cascades will lead to a smaller compensatory power of ecosystems and faster changes in ecosystem structure in response to the extirpation or re introduction of large animals depending on the specific goals of a restoration project this could be helpful or a hindrance for nature restoration these relationships between resource availability the speed of abiotic and biotic turnover and their effects on ecosystem responses to megafauna extinction or re introduction are key for trophic rewilding the biotic turnover in an ecosystem depends on the life‐cycle speed of the inhabiting organisms fig 3 ecosystems dominated by species with short life cycles e.g insects or annual plant species will generally respond faster to changing conditions i.e the introduction of large‐bodied animals than ecosystems dominated by species with long life cycles e.g long‐living trees or mammals life‐cycle speed depends on metabolic rate which scales strongly with body size west brown enquist 1997 reich 2001 brown et al. 2002 because we lack life‐history data for many especially smaller species body size biomass distributions can be used to assess the speed of biotic turnover within an ecosystem showing how ecological memory will modulate the impact of re introduced megafauna fig 3 generally we expect the speed of abiotic and biotic turnover to modulate the impact of the re introduced megafauna on the focal ecosystem by determining the longevity of ecological memory and consequently its strength the speed of abiotic and biotic turnover is therefore a key determinant of the focal ecosystem 's response to trophic rewilding the strength of ecological memory and thus the impact potential of the re introduced megafauna species should also be modified by the strength of interactions between different species in the focal ecosystem as another key determinant of the ecosystem 's response to trophic rewilding figs 2 and 3 the strength of interactions between two or more species e.g consumer–resource interactions is strongly determined by the degree of generalism of the interacting species e.g diet generalism as shown in several theoretical and empirical studies on ecological networks e.g may 1972 montoya pimm solé 2006 nichols et al. 2009 coggan 2012 generalist species can easily switch to alternative pathways like alternative food sources or alternative mutualistic partners when one or several interaction links are disrupted a negative relationship exists between the number of interactions per species degree of generalism and the mean strength of these interactions may 1972 montoya et al. 2006 in other words generalist species tend to have more but weaker interactions whereas specialist species have fewer but stronger interactions with other species thus cascading effects induced by the loss of megafauna and their associated interactions will have less pronounced and shorter duration effects in ecosystems dominated by generalist species compared to ecosystems dominated by specialist species nichols et al. 2009 garcía et al. 2013 empirical evidence for this is provided by coggan 2012 who reports diet specialisation of dung beetles to be the main driver of the strong relationship observed between megafauna extinctions and changes in dung beetle assemblages/extirpation of dung beetle species furthermore the higher the proportion of generalist species the more rapidly can lost interactions i.e information legacies in the target ecosystem be rewired after species re introduction devictor et al. 2010 genes et al. 2017 the more specialised are past interactions between extinct megafauna and extant resident species the more difficult will be the rewiring of these lost but memorised interactions by megafauna reintroduction the degree of functional similarity between the lost species and the functional counterpart planned for re introduction is therefore especially important when the specificity of interactions characterising the target ecosystem is high furthermore generalist rather than specialist species should be preferred for initial co‐introductions when interaction partners for the re introduced megafauna are heavily impoverished due to co‐extinction genes et al. 2017 nevertheless re introduced megafauna should generally create environmental heterogeneity which is a key driver of species diversity stein et al. 2014 this is a key effect of rewilding beyond megafauna‐specific memory effects and regardless of the megafaunas degree of generalism but should still relate to species pools in the landscape and thus to ecological memory information about the spectrum of generalism occurring amongst the resident species of the focal ecosystem can provide a quantitative measure of the strength of species interactions and the resulting strength of ecological memory fig 3 simple measures like the mean degree of generalism in combination with standardised measures of variation like the coefficient of variation of species generalism could already provide meaningful quantities species‐specific information about the degree of generalism is available for a large number of mammal species from databases jones et al. 2009 kissling et al. 2014 wilman et al. 2014 or from the ecological literature fig 3 databases with observational data on food webs or other mutualistic interaction networks e.g plant–pollinator or seed dispersal networks can also help determine the degree of species generalism however assessing the degree of generalism across a broad taxonomic range will be challenging due to the large proportion of species that lack diet or interaction data penone et al. 2014 and the varied ways in which data are collected for different groups of species davis pineda‐munoz 2016 mechanistic models that can infer potential species interactions based on body‐size relations between potential predators and prey gravel et al. 2013 or based on functional traits laigle et al. 2017 might provide an additional source of information when observational data about the degree of generalism for individual species are lacking fig 3 the compensatory capacity of the surrounding ecosystems is another modulator of the strength of ecological memory and consequently for the net ecosystem impact of the re introduced megafauna species figs 2 and 3 in general the compensatory capacity of surrounding source ecosystems is related to the amount of resources e.g species available in the surrounding ecosystems and the landscape connectivity allowing the transfer of species or other resources from surrounding ecosystems to the focal ecosystem conradi kollmann 2016 conradi temperton kollmann 2017 the latter is strongly related to the geographic distance and biogeographic barriers between the source and the sink ecosystems cf brunbjerg et al. 2017 conditions which also affect the spread of megafauna from surrounding ecosystems into defaunated areas ziółkowska et al. 2016 when geographic barriers are insuperable or external source ecosystems are lacking a targeted introduction of missing species parallel to the re introduction of megafauna could help to overcome missing material and information legacies actively in the focal ecosystem however such interregional or even intercontinental co‐introductions are riskier than the megafauna introductions themselves species like dung beetles or other insects may actually be harder or even impossible to control after introduction e.g lovett et al. 2016 nevertheless active translocations of smaller species are already common practice in biological control manchester bullock 2001 or restoration like the reintroduction of locally extirpated plant species via seed addition or planting as a form of active restoration e.g see donath et al. 2007 and török et al. 2011 for grasslands the fundamental challenge we have in restoration/trophic rewilding is that we want or do not want to change the state of the focal ecosystem to follow a certain restoration goal depending on this decision we must actively decrease or increase the resilience and thus attempt to erode or preserve the ecological memory maintaining the ecosystem in its current desirable or undesirable state the focal ecosystem will respond differently to megafauna re introduction based on the difference between its current state and the desired state its ecological memory and the impact potential of the chosen megafauna species restoration as well as management and monitoring strategies have to be adapted correspondingly the information we provide about the key determinants of ecosystem responses to tropic rewilding within the ecological memory–rewilding framework figs 2 and 3 can help to anticipate possible trajectories of ecosystem dynamics after rewilding and to adapt restoration management and monitoring strategies in order to maximise the success and to minimise the risk of unwanted negative outcomes of trophic rewilding or other restoration projects to facilitate the success of rewilding projects the overall goal of a restoration activity must be clearly defined a priori and the success of the implemented restoration/rewilding action in achieving this goal should be scientifically monitored for a sufficient time afterwards a clear definition of the specific goals of a restoration project e.g maintenance of biodiversity or persistence of a focal species increasing water retention or carbon storage decreasing soil erosion etc will also help to answer the fundamentally important question in adaptive nature management resilience of what to what this is crucial to identify the relevant ecosystem properties and processes that are necessary to keep or bring the focal ecosystem onto a desirable trajectory for reaching the restoration goal carpenter et al. 2001 folke 2006 higgs et al. 2014 monitoring conducted for a sufficiently long period after the initial restoration action e.g megafauna re introduction will be needed to understand the response trajectories of the restored ecosystem and to prevent the ecosystem from following unwanted response trajectories towards undesirable states adaptive management as a strategy where management decisions and actions are permanently recalibrated based on the a‐priori defined goals and the knowledge obtained from continuous monitoring of the current response trajectory of the focal ecosystem biggs rogers 2003 can be a helpful or even necessary management approach to ensure the success of any restoration project specific restoration goals can sometimes change over time when knowledge obtained about the response trajectory of the focal ecosystem or drastic changes in ecological socio‐economic or political boundary conditions reduce their desirability this adaptive way of managing restored ecosystems seems to be especially important when the focal ecosystem is far from its desired state and ecological memory is low as rewilding projects are generally planned to be open‐ended their key goals are i the promotion of dynamic landscapes natural processes and in some cases concomitant ecosystem services and ii the general maintenance of high levels of biodiversity rather than fixed reference states in species composition or habitat characteristics hughes et al. 2011 svenning et al. 2016 adaptive management as described above is particularly suitable for the monitoring and evaluation of programs with such dynamic goals 1 trophic rewilding is a novel and promising restoration approach to promote self‐sustaining biodiverse ecosystems but ambiguity still exists about the ecological outcomes of megafauna re introduction this mainly results from fragmentary empirical data and missing theoretical frameworks 2 we provide a novel conceptual framework to help anticipate ecosystem responses to trophic rewilding based on two interacting factors i the impact potential of re introduced megafauna and ii the ecological memory of the focal ecosystem 3 the impact potential of re introduced megafauna species can be estimated by species properties lifetime per capita engineering capacity population density home range size and niche overlap with resident species 4 the impact potential of re introduced megafauna species on a focal ecosystem is expected to be modulated by ecological memory through its four elements absolute time since megafauna loss the speed of abiotic and biotic turnover the strength of species interactions characterising the focal ecosystem and the compensatory capacity of surrounding source ecosystems the result of this interaction between the megafauna 's impact potential and the elements of ecological memory will determine the outcome of trophic rewilding actions 5 ecological resilience is seen in our framework as an emerging property of ecological memory the different internal and external components of ecological memory see table 1 affect the degree to which an ecosystem is capable of reorganising and adapting to future changes a crucial part of ecosystem resilience 6 we propose a strong link between ecological memory and temporally lagged responses to restoration activities stemming from disequilibrium dynamics in ecosystem assembly 7 we provide practical advice on how to characterise quantitatively the key elements of the ecological memory–rewilding framework to assess likely ecosystem responses to trophic rewilding this could help managers and practitioners to weigh plausible strategies to maximise the success of rewilding projects and minimize the risk of unwanted ecosystem changes monitoring of ecosystem responses to trophic rewilding over an extended period in combination with adaptive management strategies will help to prevent adverse effects of trophic rewilding even under unstable unpredictable conditions i.e far from equilibrium the framework and the management suggestions although specifically developed for trophic rewilding are easily transferable to other restoration projects we hope this review will help
