I have a problem with my system. I want to load a .php file into a web browser control, but whenever I tried to load my local php file it only displays the php codes. This is what I did: How can I fix this? any help would be much appreciated. In order for any PHP script to work on a web browser, it must be enabled on your server, which could be an actual server or your computer. If it isn't configured properly, or at all, then you will always see the script you wrote instead of it performing its task.  There are many tutorials online about how to setup a local server using your computer provided you have the permissions set to do so. Hope this helped, good luck!
