Mystic Messenger Live Action Edition!! | Otome Amino Hey guys! Ever thought of a live action version of MM? Here's our (along with  AYAKA ) dream cast! Bambam (GOT7) as Yoosung Jinyoung (GOT7) as V Sungjae (BTOB) as Jumin V (BTS) as Seven and Saeran Eun Woo (Astro) as Zen Bonus: Proof: I'm against kpop X anime stuff so I can't relate  :cry:  after seeing anime stage plays id rather think more about musical with actors ðŸ¤” like hakuoki or diabolik lovers has musicals Well excluding Bambam and Jinyoung, I know sunjae, V and eun woo have acting experiences and think they were great and fitted their roles here Yoosung is bam bam? Welp xux)9 I'm honestly surprised mm hasn't gotten an anime. It would be difficult but there's worse anime otome out there so I'm surprised they haven't done it for a money grab. Probably because it's korean :( honestly I'm glad they didn't try to make anything like that because I tried to watch some korean animated productions and literally fell asleep after 15mins... Still movie would be the worst option ever  :joy:  Lol I could see for sure if it was based on voice acting Into Otome?Join the community. Into Otome?Join the community.
