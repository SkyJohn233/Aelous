Water Rescue Clothing Gill Abseil glove / water rescue contoured fit (snug fitting so perfect for use under fire service debris clearance gloves) suitable for abseiling, with top of forefinger and thumb removed making manipulation of metalwork simpler. These popular Championship sailing gloves have had a few improvements. The look of them is sleeker and the grip on the palm now extends the full length of the fingers for ultimate performance. Designed for search and rescue professionals, these extremely tough gloves are reinforced with high-strength fibres for serious work in cold and wet conditions. Mudders / Mudderboot are designed to stop you from sinking into mud, sand, snow and other soft surfaces. They are light, fit to most footwear and are designed in such a way that the 'wings' remain closed until you step on soft terrain thus making it easy to also walk with them on firm ground.
