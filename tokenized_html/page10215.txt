jan 2 2008 07:08pm bmd wrote susan-i have been on femara for almost 1 year everyone is different but for me most of the bad se 's happened within the first few months sleep has always been an issue for me but i do think it was worse during the first few months joint pain was the worse then to but i still have it now when i get up from sleeping or sitting for a long time i do n't remember any actual cramps though i just really think everyone has their own reactions to these drugs you are still getting other drugs too so they may be reacting to each other i hope your onc has some answers for you tomorrow jan 2 2008 07:20pm edited mar 19 2008 09:33am by tenderisourmight well i 've had pretty much constant nightly calf cramps while on it 's kissing cousin arimidex even had episodes of frank in turning of my toes called pedospasm yikes i finally got with the program and followed the kind ladies advice here by ensuring i took my calcium magnesium and vitamin d. it 's too early to tell tonic water has quanine which often helps with the cramps but i did n't use it advil did seem to help when the pain was bad one at night on occasion also heating pad prior to sleep and gentle stretching hope you get some relief tender jan 2 2008 07:34pm susan1120 wrote thank you bmd and tender haha loved the kissin cousins is n't this just a wonderful experience we have to go thru lol not tender i did n't get my period this month either so i am figuring everything is working as it should just hoping nothing comes falling out from the netherland area i am getting me a dove soap bar for under my sheet and gon na try that alot of women swear by it for cramps or perhaps i may need to get 2 seeing as i cramp in both calf areas at least if i wake up in bubbles i will know if i am becoming incontinent giggle again thank you both for your input xoxoxo susan jan 2 2008 07:40pm edited mar 19 2008 10:06am by tenderisourmight that 's too funny susan i wonder if our dear joan suggested the dove soap bar under the sheet maybe it lubricates the toes and feet incase they cramp too however i happen to know she flatly rejected my idea of crisco anywhere near a bedroom long story earlier post loved the bubbles tiny bubbles was n't that a song tender jan 7 2008 08:41am arco wrote my wife had thigh pain foot pain hip pain at different times all through her 5+ years on femara she did a lot of exercise and then also got various pain killers added to her arsenal of pills not an easy road.. jan 7 2008 09:03am rosemary44 wrote susan ask your dr. if its ok to take calcium magnesium and potassium those 3 will usually take away the leg cramps with drinking extra filtered water throughout the day it will be better to take the magnesium separately from the calcium 2 hours apart and eat more foods high in potassium cramps should vanish if you get the dose right for yourself how much water are you actually drinking each day coffee does n't count jan 8 2008 08:42pm susan1120 wrote hi suzy my aunt was the first to tell me about this then i am also on the komen boards and it has been recommended there also you put it under the bottom sheet of your bed around your calf area and if you cramp you rub legs on it and it stops them i just bought a new bedtopper so i put my soap in a pillowcase and sleep with it in legs reach every night so far i have not had any cramps since my post i did increase potassium by diet bananas etc also all i drink anymore is water a little juice here and there but mostly water hey i suggest you put a bar in a pillow case and if your hands cramp try rubbing and see if it helps you will have to report back on this though because you will be a first i wish you the best susan mcd jan 8 2008 08:44pm susan1120 wrote hi arco is your wife done with femara now how about her memory did she forget alot how is she doing now thank you so much for your input susan jan 8 2008 08:45pm susan1120 wrote ohh dear tender yes tiny bubbles is a song lol i will be singing it if i ever wake up in bubbles love you susan jan 8 2008 08:49pm susan1120 wrote hi rosemary thank you for advice i am already on a calcium supplement with d. i am working on the potassium i am not sure about magnesium though i take paxil and i am not sure if the 2 can be taken together anyone care to enlighten me paxil is the whole reason i am on femara and ovarian suppresion i ca n't get off of it i tried and i became a train wreck waiting to happen i have been on it pre bc for panic disorder for 10 years almost 11 now i truly wish i had never started it because i do n't know if i will ever be free from it it has and does help me but i am terrified to try to go off it again right now maybe later this year i can try again love to you susan jan 9 2008 04:21am rosemary44 wrote susan i would n't know if mg and paxil will collide i take mg for the same reasons you take paxil panic attacks depression leg cramps and a whole bunch of other reasons kris might come along if it has something to do with a drug she usually can find it feb 22 2008 01:52pm sig wrote i susan glad to see your are doing fine i have been quite busy lately searching information on the net about eligard femara and herceptin and forgot to check back this web site i also have pelvic pain more intense on the left side this has started about 1 month after my eligard shot so i have been searching for info and could not find anything related so now i read that you also have pelvic pain then may be it has something to do with eligard i also have leg cramps/pain similar when i was getting taxol but less painful i do 60 mins of exercise every day and i find this very helpful for the leg pain are you constantly losing weight because i have been and my oncologist told me this was very unusual and right now i am going through several tests in order to figure out the reason she scared me because right now i am underweight 44 kg i lost 15 kg since the start of my chemo i am constantly eating and i am now quite fed up of eating is your estradiol level remains low with eligard sig jan 21 2011 01:52pm lcrowe wrote hey i know this is almost three years old but i 've been having leg cramps for the last three or four days and nothing helps and i 'm on femara taking d calcium etc just went back to work after a long winter vacation so i suspect that 's part of the problem i 'd heard from a chiropractor that running around can deplete vitamins and minerals just like running an actual marathon can but at least i now know it 's related also to femara jan 21 2011 01:57pm lcrowe wrote will also try the dove soap in bed as well as on the easy chair while watching tv interesting jan 26 2012 05:09am magcline wrote i have been on both arimidex or femara since my treatment for stage 1 breast cancer ended in august 2008 i have taken myself off both of these drugs to gain some respite from the hideous side effects i have experienced that include severe bone and joint pain horrifying leg cramps at night arthritis-like debility thin hair lack of libido etc the first time i came off arimidex i finally started to feel like i was recovering from my treatment and i stayed off it for six months my onc convinced me that studies show that those women who suffer the worst side effects are most likely those women who receive the most benefit from the drug i went back on femara until march 2011 and that time i stayed off it for 3 months sad to report that my recovery was not quite as dramatic as the first time it is now 34 months of taking these drugs and that means that i have 26 more months to go but now that my rheumatologist has my bone and joint pain under control arthrotec 75 mg x 2 daily cyclobenzaprine 10 mg x 2 daily and the latest miracle drug co q10 over the counter i am suffering from hideous leg cramps i am considering taking another break from the aromatase inhibitors just to enjoy a few pain free months and get some sleep my oncotype dx score was 39 so i 'm terrified not to continue this drug but the thought of having to do an additional 5 years as studies suggest is something i just ca n't contemplate i count the days until my initial 5 years are up good luck ladies and go see a rheumatologist even if i have to take 5 pills to overcome some of the side effects of that nasty litte tiny pill i am determined to somehow get 60 months of that stuff into me new goal additional meds to get rid of the leg cramps jan 14 2013 03:58am joanm917 wrote i am only 10 days into femara and the legs and feet cramps during the night are so painful also dealt with my head getting soaking wet had to get up and use a towel to dry my hair some and change my pillow case i am an awful sleeper to start with and these added afflictions are awful i was taking arimedex but had the same issues so my doctor switched me to femara i am ready to take my chances and not take any of these drugs jan 14 2013 04:16am momine wrote joan i started taking a small dose of magnesium daily i started to improve my d/calcium absorbtion but it also seems to have improved the leg cramps as far as the night sweats that drove me nuts at first too it has however calmed down to the point that it does n't bother me very often anymore it was worst the first 3 months or so aug 11 2014 10:06am duck1216 wrote i know putting a bar of soap between the sheets sounds ridiculous but putting a bar of ivory soap between my sheets has always worked to get rid of my leg cramps mar 4 2015 05:45pm cybermab wrote this is a pretty old topic but i have been on femara since september and about two weeks ago awoke in the night to go to the bathroom as i was getting out of bed i had this indescribable pain in my leg it was so bad that i thought i had a blood clot or was dying or something it was different than any other leg cramp i 'd ever had as it was n't confined to my arch or calf and did n't respond to my pointing my toes toward my knee as cramps always had in the past after several minutes of bearing weight on my leg it subsided today i was resting in bed as i am recovering from a nasty bout of bronchitis and i got a similar cramp only this one was centered on the top of my ankle and forced my foot upward so i could n't move it these cramps feel like i 'm being taken over by aliens i assume they 're from the femara just as i was getting over the crazy joint pain side effects now this i hate to gripe but i would love to feel that i was back in my old pre-bc body thank you for letting me rant mary anne mar 5 2015 10:00am kicks wrote i have been on femara/letrozole for 5+ yrs and i get horrendous leg cramps at times however it is not the femara/letrozole that is at fault it is low k potassium levels 1/2 way through 12 weekly taxol my k levels 'tanked and had to go on mega doses of k to keep levels in normal range i still have to take k to keep levels up but occasionally it will drop and i have to increase for a while then drop back a bit when a cramp happens i take another k and within minutes it will subside if i do n't take it will get worse and continue happening until i get k levels back up this may not have anything to do with your cramping issues and certainly do not take mega doses of k without your dr 's approval as too much k can be as deadly as too little i have the approval of my drs to handle my issues as i do after blood work showed the issue and i do get check mg magnesium and zn zinc levels also need to be in proper ratios talk to your dr page 1 of 1 20 results back to top comunidad en
