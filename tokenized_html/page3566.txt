efficiently visualizing fmri activation volumes on 3d reconstructions of anatomical surfaces to be used in functional analysis the idea is to be able to take time-spliced brain images sampled as a subject is exposed to a changing visual stimulus and map the activated regions onto a 3d model of the subject 's brain in an easily usable manner conducting a behavioral psychophysics research study
