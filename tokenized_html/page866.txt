time please be patient click on above to rodney m. donlan additional article information microorganisms attach to surfaces and develop biofilms biofilm-associated cells can be differentiated from their suspended counterparts by generation of an extracellular polymeric substance eps matrix reduced growth rates and the up- and down- regulation of specific genes attachment is a complex process regulated by diverse characteristics of the growth medium substratum and cell surface an established biofilm structure comprises microbial cells and eps has a defined architecture and provides an optimal environment for the exchange of genetic material between cells cells may also communicate via quorum sensing which may in turn affect biofilm processes such as detachment biofilms have great importance for public health because of their role in certain infectious diseases and importance in a variety of device-related infections a greater understanding of biofilm processes should lead to novel effective control strategies for biofilm control and a resulting improvement in patient management for most of the history of microbiology microorganisms have primarily been characterized as planktonic freely suspended cells and described on the basis of their growth characteristics in nutritionally rich culture media rediscovery of a microbiologic phenomenon first described by van leeuwenhoek that microorganisms attach to and grow universally on exposed surfaces led to studies that revealed surface-associated microorganisms biofilms exhibited a distinct phenotype with respect to gene transcription and growth rate these biofilm microorganisms have been shown to elicit specific mechanisms for initial attachment to a surface development of a community structure and ecosystem and detachment a biofilm is an assemblage of surface-associated microbial cells that is enclosed in an extracellular polymeric substance matrix van leeuwenhoek using his simple microscopes first observed microorganisms on tooth surfaces and can be credited with the discovery of microbial biofilms heukelekian and heller 1 observed the x0201c bottle effect x0201d for marine microorganisms i.e. bacterial growth and activity were substantially enhanced by the incorporation of a surface to which these organisms could attach zobell 2 observed that the number of bacteria on surfaces was dramatically higher than in the surrounding medium in this case seawater however a detailed examination of biofilms would await the electron microscope which allowed high-resolution photomicroscopy at much higher magnifications than did the light microscope jones et al 3 used scanning and transmission electron microscopy to examine biofilms on trickling filters in a wastewater treatment plant and showed them to be composed of a variety of organisms based on cell morphology by using a specific polysaccharide-stain called ruthenium red and coupling this with osmium tetroxide fixative these researchers were also able to show that the matrix material surrounding and enclosing cells in these biofilms was polysaccharide as early as 1973 characklis 4 studied microbial slimes in industrial water systems and showed that they were not only very tenacious but also highly resistant to disinfectants such as chlorine based on observations of dental plaque and sessile communities in mountain streams costerton et al 5 in 1978 put forth a theory of biofilms that explained the mechanisms whereby microorganisms adhere to living and nonliving materials and the benefits accrued by this ecologic niche since that time the studies of biofilms in industrial and ecologic settings and in environments more relevant for public health have basically paralleled each other much of the work in the last 2 decades has relied on tools such as scanning electron microscopy sem or standard microbiologic culture techniques for biofilm characterization two major thrusts in the last decade have dramatically impacted our understanding of biofilms the utilization of the confocal laser scanning microscope to characterize biofilm ultrastructure and an investigation of the genes involved in cell adhesion and biofilm formation a biofilm is an assemblage of microbial cells that is irreversibly associated not removed by gentle rinsing with a surface and enclosed in a matrix of primarily polysaccharide material noncellular materials such as mineral crystals corrosion particles clay or silt particles or blood components depending on the environment in which the biofilm has developed may also be found in the biofilm matrix biofilm-associated organisms also differ from their planktonic freely suspended counterparts with respect to the genes that are transcribed biofilms may form on a wide variety of surfaces including living tissues indwelling medical devices industrial or potable water system piping or natural aquatic systems the variable nature of biofilms can be illustrated from scanning electron micrographs of biofilms from an industrial water system and a medical device respectively figures 1 and x200b and2 2 the water system biofilm is highly complex containing corrosion products clay material fresh water diatoms and filamentous bacteria the biofilm on the medical device on the other hand appears to be composed of a single coccoid organism and the associated extracellular polymeric substance eps matrix the solid-liquid interface between a surface and an aqueous medium e.g. water blood provides an ideal environment for the attachment and growth of microorganisms a clear picture of attachment can not be obtained without considering the effects of the substratum conditioning films forming on the substratum hydrodynamics of the aqueous medium characteristics of the medium and various properties of the cell surface each of these factors will be considered in detail the solid surface may have several characteristics that are important in the attachment process characklis et al 6 noted that the extent of microbial colonization appears to increase as the surface roughness increases this is because shear forces are diminished and surface area is higher on rougher surfaces the physicochemical properties of the surface may also exert a strong influence on the rate and extent of attachment most investigators have found that microorganisms attach more rapidly to hydrophobic nonpolar surfaces such as teflon and other plastics than to hydrophilic materials such as glass or metals 7 x02013 9 even though results of these studies have at times been contradictory because no standardized methods exist for determining surface hydrophobicity some kind of hydrophobic interaction apparently occurs between the cell surface and the substratum that would enable the cell to overcome the repulsive forces active within a certain distance from the substratum surface and irreversibly attach a material surface exposed in an aqueous medium will inevitably and almost immediately become conditioned or coated by polymers from that medium and the resulting chemical modification will affect the rate and extent of microbial attachment loeb and neihof 10 were the first to report the formation of these conditioning films on surfaces exposed in seawater these researchers found that films were organic in nature formed within minutes of exposure and continued to grow for several hours the nature of conditioning films may be quite different for surfaces exposed in the human host a prime example may be the proteinaceous conditioning film called x0201c acquired pellicle x0201d which develops on tooth enamel surfaces in the oral cavity pellicle comprises albumin lysozyme glycoproteins phosphoproteins lipids and gingival crevice fluid 11 bacteria from the oral cavity colonize pellicle-conditioned surfaces within hours of exposure to these surfaces mittelman noted that a number of host-produced conditioning films such as blood tears urine saliva intervascular fluid and respiratory secretions influence the attachment of bacteria to biomaterials 12 ofek and doyle 13 also noted that the surface energy of the suspending medium may affect hydrodynamic interactions of microbial cells with surfaces by altering the substratum characteristics in theory the flow velocity immediately adjacent to the substratum/liquid interface is negligible this zone of negligible flow is termed the hydrodynamic boundary layer its thickness is dependent on linear velocity the higher the velocity the thinner the boundary layer the region outside the boundary layer is characterized by substantial mixing or turbulence for flow regimes characterized as laminar or minimally turbulent the hydrodynamic boundary layer may substantially affect cell-substratum interactions cells behave as particles in a liquid and the rate of settling and association with a submerged surface will depend largely on the velocity characteristics of the liquid under very low linear velocities the cells must traverse the sizeable hydrodynamic boundary layer and association with the surface will depend in large part on cell size and cell motility as the velocity increases the boundary layer decreases and cells will be subjected to increasingly greater turbulence and mixing higher linear velocities would therefore be expected to equate to more rapid association with the surface at least until velocities become high enough to exert substantial shear forces on the attaching cells resulting in detachment of these cells 14 this finding has been confirmed in studies by rijnaarts et al 15 and zheng et al 16 other characteristics of the aqueous medium such as ph nutrient levels ionic strength and temperature may play a role in the rate of microbial attachment to a substratum several studies have shown a seasonal effect on bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in different aqueous systems 17 18 this effect may be due to water temperature or to other unmeasured seasonally affected parameters fletcher 19 20 found that an increase in the concentration of several cations sodium calcium lanthanum ferric iron affected the attachment of pseudomonas fluorescens to glass surfaces presumably by reducing the repulsive forces between the negatively charged bacterial cells and the glass surfaces cowan et al 21 showed in a laboratory study that an increase in nutrient concentration correlated with an increase in the number of attached bacterial cells cell surface hydrophobicity presence of fimbriae and flagella and production of eps all influence the rate and extent of attachment of microbial cells the hydrophobicity of the cell surface is important in adhesion because hydrophobic interactions tend to increase with an increasing nonpolar nature of one or both surfaces involved i.e. the microbial cell surface and the substratum surface most bacteria are negatively charged but still contain hydrophobic surface components as noted by rosenberg and kjelleberg 22 fimbriae i.e. nonflagellar appendages other than those involved in transfer of viral or bacterial nucleic acids called pili contribute to cell surface hydrophobicity most fimbriae that have been examined contain a high proportion of hydrophobic amino acid residues 22 fimbriae play a role in cell surface hydrophobicity and attachment probably by overcoming the initial electrostatic repulsion barrier that exists between the cell and substratum 23 a number of aquatic bacteria possess fimbriae which have also been shown to be involved in bacterial attachment to animal cells 23 rosenburg et al 24 and bullitt and makowski 25 provided evidence for the role of fimbriae in bacterial attachment to surfaces other cell surface properties may also facilitate attachment several studies have shown that treatment of adsorbed cells with proteolytic enzymes caused a marked release of attached bacteria 26 27 providing evidence for the role of proteins in attachment bendinger et al 9 found that mycolic acid-containing organisms corynebacterium nocardia and mycobacterium were more hydrophobic than were nonmycolic acid-containing bacteria and increase in mycolic acid chain length generally coincided with increase in hydrophobicity for most strains tested adhesion was greater on hydrophobic materials the o antigen component of lipopolysaccharide lps has also been shown to confer hydrophilic properties to gram-negative bacteria williams and fletcher 28 showed that mutants of p. fluorescens lacking the o antigen adhered in greater numbers to hydrophobic materials as early as 1971 marshall et al 29 provided evidence based on sem that attached bacteria were associated with the surface via fine extracellular polymeric fibrils fletcher et al 30 found that treatment of attached freshwater bacteria with cations resulted in contraction of the initial adhesives decrease in the cell distance from the substratum supporting the idea that this material was an anionic polymer cations have been shown to cross-link the anionic groups of polymers such as polysaccharides resulting in contraction beech and gaylarde 31 found that lectins inhibited but did not prevent attachment glucosidase and n-acetylglucosaminidase reduced attachment for p. fluorescens while nag reduced attachment for desulfovibrio desulfuricans lectins preferentially bind to polysaccharides on the cell surface or to the eps binding of lectins by the cells would minimize the attachment sites and affect cell attachment if polysaccharides were involved in attachment zottola 32 confirmed the role of polysaccharides in attachment in studies with pseudomonas fragi korber et al 33 used motile and nonmotile strains of p. fluorescens to show that motile cells attach in greater numbers and attach against the flow backgrowth more rapidly than do nonmotile strains nonmotile strains also do not recolonize or seed vacant areas on a substratum as evenly as motile strains resulting in slower biofilm formation by the nonmotile organisms flagella apparently play an important role in attachment in the early stages of bacterial attachment by overcoming the repulsive forces associated with the substratum in light of these findings cell surface structures such as fimbriae other proteins lps eps and flagella all clearly play an important role in the attachment process cell surface polymers with nonpolar sites such as fimbriae other proteins and components of certain gram-positive bacteria mycolic acids appear to dominate attachment to hydrophobic substrata while eps and lipopolysaccharides are more important in attachment to hydrophilic materials flagella are important in attachment also although their role may be to overcome repulsive forces rather than to act as adsorbents or adhesives the attachment of microorganisms to surfaces is a very complex process with many variables affecting the outcome in general attachment will occur most readily on surfaces that are rougher more hydrophobic and coated by surface x0201c conditioning x0201d films an increase in flow velocity water temperature or nutrient concentration may also equate to increased attachment if these factors do not exceed critical levels properties of the cell surface specifically the presence of fimbriae flagella and surface-associated polysaccharides or proteins also are important and may possibly provide a competitive advantage for one organism where a mixed community is involved table 1 summarizes the variables important in cell attachment and biofilm formation evidence is mounting that up- and down-regulation of a number of genes occurs in the attaching cells upon initial interaction with the substratum davies and geesey 34 demonstrated algc up-regulation in individual bacterial cells within minutes of attachment to surfaces in a flow cell system this phenomenon is not limited to p. aeruginosa prigent-combaret et al 35 found that 22 of these genes were up-regulated in the biofilm state and 16 were down-regulated becker et al 36 showed that biofilms of staphylococcus aureus were up-regulated for genes encoding enzymes involved in glycolysis or fermentation phosphoglycerate mutase triosephosphate isomerase and alcohol dehydrogenase and surmised that the up-regulation of these genes could be due to oxygen limitation in the developed biofilm favoring fermentation a recent study by pulcini 37 also showed that algd algu rpos and genes controlling polyphosphokinase ppk synthesis were up-regulated in biofilm formation of p. aeruginosa prigent-combaret et al 35 opined that the expression of genes in biofilms is evidently modulated by the dynamic physicochemical factors external to the cell and may involve complex regulatory pathways biofilms are composed primarily of microbial cells and eps eps may account for 50 to 90 of the total organic carbon of biofilms 38 and can be considered the primary matrix material of the biofilm eps may vary in chemical and physical properties but it is primarily composed of polysaccharides some of these polysaccharides are neutral or polyanionic as is the case for the eps of gram-negative bacteria the presence of uronic acids such as d-glucuronic d-galacturonic and mannuronic acids or ketal-linked pryruvates confers the anionic property 39 this property is important because it allows association of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium which have been shown to cross-link with the polymer strands and provide greater binding force in a developed biofilm 38 in the case of some gram-positive bacteria such as the staphylococci the chemical composition of eps may be quite different and may be primarily cationic hussain et al 40 found that the slime of coagulase-negative bacteria consists of a teichoic acid mixed with small quantities of proteins eps is also highly hydrated because it can incorporate large amounts of water into its structure by hydrogen bonding eps may be hydrophobic although most types of eps are both hydrophilic and hydrophobic 39 eps may also vary in its solubility sutherland 39 noted two important properties of eps that may have a marked effect on the biofilm first the composition and structure of the polysaccharides determine their primary conformation for example many bacterial eps possess backbone structures that contain 1,3- or 1,4- x003b2 -linked hexose residues and tend to be more rigid less deformable and in certain cases poorly soluble or insoluble other eps molecules may be readily soluble in water second the eps of biofilms is not generally uniform but may vary spatially and temporally leriche et al 41 used the binding specificity of lectins to simple sugars to evaluate bacterial biofilm development by different organisms these researchers x02019 results showed that different organisms produce differing amounts of eps and that the amount of eps increases with age of the biofilm eps may associate with metal ions divalent cations other macromolecules such as proteins dna lipids and even humic substances 38 eps production is known to be affected by nutrient status of the growth medium excess available carbon and limitation of nitrogen potassium or phosphate promote eps synthesis 39 slow bacterial growth will also enhance eps production 39 because eps is highly hydrated it prevents desiccation in some natural biofilms eps may also contribute to the antimicrobial resistance properties of biofilms by impeding the mass transport of antibiotics through the biofilm probably by binding directly to these agents 42 tolker-nielsen and molin noted that every microbial biofilm community is unique 43 although some structural attributes can generally be considered universal the term biofilm is in some ways a misnomer since biofilms are not a continuous monolayer surface deposit rather biofilms are very heterogeneous containing microcolonies of bacterial cells encased in an eps matrix and separated from other microcolonies by interstitial voids water channels 44 figure 3 shows a biofilm of p. aeruginosa klebsiella pneumoniae and flavobacterium spp that has developed on a steel surface in a laboratory potable water system this image clearly depicts the water channels and heterogeneity characteristic of a mature biofilm liquid flow occurs in these water channels allowing diffusion of nutrients oxygen and even antimicrobial agents this concept of heterogeneity is descriptive not only for mixed culture biofilms such as might be found in environmental biofilms but also for pure culture biofilms common on medical devices and those associated with infectious diseases stoodley et al 45 defined certain criteria or characteristics that could be considered descriptive of biofilms in general including a thin base film ranging from a patchy monolayer of cells to a film several layers thick containing water channels the organisms composing the biofilm may also have a marked effect on the biofilm structure for example james et al 46 showed that biofilm thickness could be affected by the number of component organisms pure cultures of either k. pneumoniae or p aeruginosa biofilms in a laboratory reactor were thinner 15 x003bc and 30 x003bc respectively whereas a biofilm containing both species was thicker 40 x003bc jones et al noted that this could be because one species enhanced the stability of the other biofilm architecture is heterogeneous both in space and time constantly changing because of external and internal processes tolker-nielsen et al 47 investigated the role of cell motility in biofilm architecture in flow cells by examining the interactions of p. aeruginosa and p. putida by confocal laser scanning microscopy when these two organisms were added to the flow cell system each organism initially formed small microcolonies with time the colonies intermixed showing the migration of cells from one microcolony to the other the microcolony structure changed from a compact structure to a looser structure over time and when this occurred the cells inside the microcolonies were observed to be motile motile cells ultimately dispersed from the biofilm resulting in dissolution of the microcolony structure may also be influenced by the interaction of particles of nonmicrobial components from the host or environment for example erythrocytes and fibrin may accumulate as the biofilm forms biofilms on native heart valves provide a clear example of this type of interaction in which bacterial microcolonies of the biofilm develop in a matrix of platelets fibrin and eps 48 the fibrin capsule that develops will protect the organisms in these biofilms from the leukocytes of the host leading to infective endocarditis biofilms on urinary catheters may contain organisms that have the ability to hydrolyze urea in the urine to form free ammonia through the action of urease the ammonia may then raise the ph at the biofilm-liquid interface resulting in the precipitation of minerals such as calcium phosphate hydroxyapatite and magnesium ammonium phosphate struvite 49 these minerals can then become entrapped in the biofilm and cause encrustation of the catheter cases have been described in which the catheter became completely blocked by this mineral build-up minerals such as calcium carbonate corrosion products such as iron oxides and soil particles may often collect in biofilms of potable and industrial water systems providing yet another example of particle interactions with biofilms 50 the basic structural unit of the biofilm is the microcolony proximity of cells within the microcolony or between microcolonies figure 4a and b provides an ideal environment for creation of nutrient gradients exchange of genes and quorum sensing since microcolonies may be composed of multiple species the cycling of various nutrients e.g. nitrogen sulfur and carbon through redox reactions can readily occur in aquatic and soil biofilms biofilms also provide an ideal niche for the exchange of extrachromosomal dna plasmids conjugation the mechanism of plasmid transfer occurs at a greater rate between cells in biofilms than between planktonic cells 51 x02013 53 ghigo 54 has suggested that medically relevant strains of bacteria that contain conjugative plasmids more readily develop biofilms he showed that the f conjugative pilus encoded by the tra operon of the f plasmid acts as an adhesion factor for both cell-surface and cell-cell interactions resulting in a three-dimensional biofilm of escherichia coli plasmid-carrying strains have also been shown to transfer plasmids to recipient organisms resulting in biofilm formation without plasmids these same organisms produce only microcolonies without any further development the probable reason for enhanced conjugation is that the biofilm environment provides minimal shear and closer cell-to-cell contact since plasmids may encode for resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents biofilm association also provides a mechanism for selecting for and promoting the spread of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents cell-to-cell signaling has recently been demonstrated to play a role in cell attachment and detachment from biofilms xie et al 55 showed that certain dental plaque bacteria can modulate expression of the genes encoding fimbrial expression fima in porphyromonas gingivalis p. gingivalis would not attach to streptococcus cristatis biofilms grown on glass slides p. gingivalis on the other hand readily attached to s. gordonii s. cristatus cell-free extract substantially affected expression of fima in p. gingivalis as determined by using a reporter system s. cristatus is able to modulate p. gingivalis fima expression and prevent its attachment to the biofilm davies et al 56 showed that two different cell-to-cell signaling systems in p. aeruginosa lasr-lasi and rhlr-rhli were involved in biofilm formation at sufficient population densities these signals reach concentrations required for activation of genes involved in biofilm differentiation mutants unable to produce both signals double mutant were able to produce a biofilm but unlike the wild type their biofilms were much thinner cells were more densely packed and the typical biofilm architecture was lacking in addition these mutant biofilms were much more easily removed from surfaces by a surfactant treatment addition of homoserine lactone to the medium containing the mutant biofilms resulted in biofilms similar to the wild type with respect to structure and thickness stickler et al 57 also detected acylated homoserine lactone signals homoserine lactone signals in biofilms of gram-negative bacteria on urethral catheters yung-hua et al 58 showed that induction of genetic competence enabling the uptake and incorporation of exogenous dna by transformation is also mediated by quorum sensing in s. mutans transformational frequencies were 10 x02013 600 times higher in biofilms than planktonic cells bacteria within biofilms may be subject to predation by free-living protozoa bdellovibrio spp. bacteriophage and polymorphonuclear leukocytes pmns as a result of localized cell concentration murga et al 59 demonstrated the colonization and subsequent predation of heterotrophic biofilms by hartmannella vermiformis a free-living protozoon predation has also been demonstrated with acanthamoeba spp in contact lens storage case biofilms 60 james et al 46 noted that competition also occurs within biofilms and demonstrated that invasion of a hyphomicrobium sp biofilm by p. putida resulted in dominance by the p. putida even though the biofilm-associated hyphomicrobium numbers remained relatively constant stewart et al 61 investigated biofilms containing k. pneumonia and p. aeruginosa and found that both species are able to coexist in a stable community even though p. aeruginosa growth rates are much slower in the mixed culture biofilm than when grown as a pure culture biofilm p. aeruginosa grow primarily as a base biofilm whereas k. pneumoniae form localized microcolonies covering only about 10 of the area that may have greater access to nutrients and oxygen apparently p. aeruginosa can compete because it colonizes the surface rapidly and establishes a long-term competitive advantage k. pneumoniae apparently survives because of its ability to attach to the p. aeruginosa biofilm grow more rapidly and out-compete the p. aeruginosa in the surface layers of the biofilm several frank bacterial pathogens have been shown to associate with and in some cases actually grow in biofilms including legionella pneumophila 59 s. aureus 62 listeria monocytogenes 63 campylobacter spp 64 e. coli o157 h7 65 salmonella typhimurium 66 vibrio cholerae 67 and helicobacter pylori 68 although all these organisms have the ability to attach to surfaces and existing biofilms most if not all appear incapable of extensive growth in the biofilm this may be because of their fastidious growth requirements or because of their inability to compete with indigenous organisms the mechanism of interaction and growth apparently varies with the pathogen and at least for l. pneumophila appears to require the presence of free-living protozoa to grow in the biofilm 59 survival and growth of pathogenic organisms within biofilms might also be enhanced by the association and metabolic interactions with indigenous organisms camper et al 65 showed that salmonella typhimurium persisted in a model distribution system containing undefined heterotrophic bacteria from an unfiltered reverse osmosis water system for x0003e 50 days which suggests that the normal biofilm flora of this water system provided niche conditions capable of supporting the growth of this organism the picture of biofilms increasingly is one in which there is both heterogeneity and a constant flux as this biological community adapts to changing environmental conditions and the composition of the community biofilm cells may be dispersed either by shedding of daughter cells from actively growing cells detachment as a result of nutrient levels or quorum sensing or shearing of biofilm aggregates continuous removal of small portions of the biofilm because of flow effects the mechanisms underlying the process of shedding by actively growing cells in a biofilm are not well understood gilbert et al 69 showed that surface hydrophobicity characteristics of newly divided daughter cells spontaneously dispersed from either e. coli or p. aeruginosa biofilms differ substantially from those of either chemostat-intact biofilms or resuspended biofilm cells these researchers suggested that these differences might explain newly divided daughter cells x02019 detachment hydrophobicity was lowest for the newly dispersed cells and steadily increases upon continued incubation and growth alginate is the major component of the eps of p. aeruginosa boyd and chakrabarty 70 studied alginate lyase production in p. aeruginosa to determine whether increased expression of this enzyme affected the size of the alginate molecules and therefore adhesion of the organisms inducing alginate lyase expression substantially decreased the amount of alginate produced which corresponded with a significant increase in the number of detached cells the authors suggested that the role of algl the gene cassette for alginate lyase production in wild type p. aeruginosa may be to cause a release of cells from solid surfaces or biofilms aiding in the dispersal of these organisms polysaccharidase enzymes specific for the eps of different organisms may possibly be produced during different phases of biofilm growth of these organisms detachment caused by physical forces has been studied in greater detail brading et al 71 have emphasized the importance of physical forces in detachment stating that the three main processes for detachment are erosion or shearing continuous removal of small portions of the biofilm sloughing rapid and massive removal and abrasion detachment due to collision of particles from the bulk fluid with the biofilm characklis 72 noted that the rate of erosion from the biofilm increases with increase in biofilm thickness and fluid shear at the biofilm-bulk liquid interface with increase in flow velocity the hydrodynamic boundary layer decreases resulting in mixing and turbulence closer to the biofilm surface sloughing is more random than erosion and is thought to result from nutrient or oxygen depletion within the biofilm structure 71 sloughing is more commonly observed with thicker biofilms that have developed in nutrient-rich environments 72 biofilms in fluidized beds filters and particle-laden environments surface waters may be subject to abrasion detachment is probably also species specific p. fluorescens disperses and recolonizes a surface in a flow cell after approximately 5 h v. parahaemolyticus after 4 h and v. harveyi after only 2 h 73 this process probably provides a mechanism for cells to migrate from heavily colonized areas that have been depleted of surface-adsorbed nutrients to areas more supportive of growth the mode of dispersal apparently affects the phenotypic characteristics of the organisms eroded or sloughed aggregates from the biofilm are likely to retain certain biofilm characteristics such as antimicrobial resistance properties whereas cells that have been shed as a result of growth may revert quickly to the planktonic phenotype clinical and public health microbiologists x02019 recognition that microbial biofilms are ubiquitous in nature has resulted in the study of a number of infectious disease processes from a biofilm perspective cystic fibrosis native valve endocarditis otitis media periodontitis and chronic prostatitis all appear to be caused by biofilm-associated microorganisms a spectrum of indwelling medical devices or other devices used in the health-care environment have been shown to harbor biofilms resulting in measurable rates of device-associated infections 74 table 2 provides a listing of microorganisms commonly associated with biofilms on indwelling medical devices biofilms of potable water distribution systems have the potential to harbor enteric pathogens l. pneumophila nontuberculous mycobacteria and possibly helicobacter pylori what is less clear is an understanding of how interaction and growth of pathogenic organisms in a biofilm result in an infectious disease process characteristics of biofilms that can be important in infectious disease processes include a detachment of cells or biofilm aggregates may result in bloodstream or urinary tract infections or in the production of emboli b cells may exchange resistance plasmids within biofilms c cells in biofilms have dramatically reduced susceptibility to antimicrobial agents d biofilm-associated gram-negative bacteria may produce endotoxins and e biofilms are resistant to host immune system clearance please refer to the online appendix for an expanded discussion of each of these mechanisms url http //www.cdc.gov/ncid/eid/vol8/no9donlan.htm research on microbial biofilms is proceeding on many fronts with particular emphasis on elucidation of the genes specifically expressed by biofilm-associated organisms evaluation of various control strategies including medical devices treated with antimicrobial agents and antimicrobial locks for either preventing or remediating biofilm colonization of medical devices and development of new methods for assessing the efficacy of these treatments research should also focus on the role of biofilms in antimicrobial resistance biofilms as a reservoir for pathogenic organisms and the role of biofilms in chronic diseases the field of microbiology has come to accept the universality of the biofilm phenotype researchers in the fields of clinical food and water and environmental microbiology have begun to investigate microbiologic processes from a biofilm perspective as the pharmaceutical and health-care industries embrace this approach novel strategies for biofilm prevention and control will undoubtedly emerge the key to success may hinge upon a more complete understanding of what makes the biofilm phenotype so different from the planktonic phenotype dr. donlan is the team leader for the biofilm laboratory in the division of healthcare quality promotion at the centers for
