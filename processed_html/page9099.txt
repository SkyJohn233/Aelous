energetics of AGN radiation pressure-driven outflows | Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | Oxford Academic W Ishibashi, A C Fabian, R Maiolino,  The energetics of AGN radiation pressure-driven outflows,  Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , Volume 476, Issue 1, May 2018, Pages 512–519,  https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty236 Download citation file: The increasing observational evidence of galactic outflows is considered as a sign of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in action. However, the physical mechanism responsible for driving the observed outflows remains unclear, and whether it is due to momentum, energy, or radiation is still a matter of debate. The observed outflow energetics, in particular the large measured values of the momentum ratio ( ⁠ ˙ p / ( L / c ) ∼ 10 \dot{p}/(L/c) \sim 10 ⁠ ) and energy ratio ( ⁠ ˙ E k / L ∼ 0.05 \dot{E}_{\rm k}/L \sim 0.05 ⁠ ), seems to favour the energy-driving mechanism; and most observational works have focused their comparison with wind energy-driven models. Here, we show that AGN radiation pressure on dust can adequately reproduce the observed outflow energetics (mass outflow rate, momentum flux, and kinetic power), as well as the scalings with luminosity, provided that the effects of radiation trapping are properly taken into account. In particular, we predict a sublinear scaling for the mass outflow rate ( ⁠ ˙ M ∝ L 1 / 2 \dot{M} \propto L^{1/2} ⁠ ) and a superlinear scaling for the kinetic power ( ⁠ ˙ E k ∝ L 3 / 2 \dot{E}_{\rm k} \propto L^{3/2} ⁠ ), in agreement with the observational scaling relations reported in the most recent compilation of AGN outflow data. We conclude that AGN radiative feedback can account for the global outflow energetics, at least equally well as the wind energy-driving mechanism, and therefore both physical models should be considered in the interpretation of future AGN outflow observations.
