Supreme Court orders Halla-aho to pay for hate speech | Yle Uutiset | yle.fi Finland’s highest court ordered Halla-aho to pay 50 day fines, instead of 30 levied by a lower court, for statements about Somali immigrants. Two lower courts previously dismissed hate charges against Halla-aho and only fined him for defaming religion. The Supreme Court said Halla-aho’s posts, which likened Islam to pedophilia and said Somalis are predisposed to stealing and living off welfare, qualified as inciting hatred against an ethnic group.
