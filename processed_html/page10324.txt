The workflow runs without errors. The image is downloaded successfully and outputted as a blob. (HTTP/1.1 200 OK and confirmed if I output to an image tool.) But the POST request returns with HTTP/1.1 100 Continue and no image in my destination. What am I doing wrong or how do I handle the 100 Continue? The first GET request is configured as: The second POST request is configured as: A few notes from the API documentation: • The POST request has to be multipart/form-data with the binary image data submitted as the value of the image field of the form. • Images can be in jpg/png formats. The image cannot be submitted as the URL pointing to the file. Thanks for any help.
