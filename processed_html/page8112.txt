Sarah Lehr (Photo: Matthew Dae Smith/Lansing State Journal) "Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants." That adage, attributed to former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, applies especially to local government. Democracy cannot function if citizens are uninformed. The  Michigan Freedom of Information Act  keeps people informed by ensuring access to public documents. Public records, for instance, have shed light on shortcomings in Lansing's public housing. Recent inquiries into the Lansing Housing Commission, an agency under oversight from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, began with a tragedy at the LaRoy Froh housing complex. A mother and her child died June 7 in  an early morning fire at a publicly-managed townhome. Investigators said smoke detectors were working properly at the time of the incident, but the deaths still raised questions about whether public institutions could have prevented the fire. On the day of the fire, the Lansing State Journal filed FOIA requests for records, including reports from city rental inspections at the townhouse. City officials initially said the city would not release those inspection records until after the Lansing Fire Marshal's office had completed its investigation into the fire's cause, but Lansing Mayor Andy Schor later agreed to release the documents on a more accelerated timeline.

The records  revealed that the townhome had burned  after failing its most recent rental inspection in 2016. City inspectors had identified numerous safety issues, including damaged electrical outlets, but the housing commission failed to provide documentation to the city to prove that management had fixed those problems. And city officials failed to follow up to ensure compliance from the housing commission. In fact, because of the lack of follow-up, the vast majority of Lansing public housing complexes lacked rental licenses from the city  certifying that the units were safe to rent , a review by the Lansing State Journal found. The cause of the LaRoy Froh fire  is still officially "undetermined,"  according to a fire marshal's investigation, and Lansing Mayor Andy Schor has said he does not believe city inspections could have prevented the fire if it was electrical in nature. Nonetheless, the release of inspection records put pressure on local officials. Schor, who took office in 2018, ordered city code officers to re-inspect all public housing units in the city. To date, the housing commission has spent at least $100,000 on repairs mandated by city inspectors, LHC Interim Executive Director Doug Fleming said. The  housing commission's former executive director resigned  under pressure from  Lansing City Council members  who criticized the agency's response to the fire, among other issues. Without FOIA laws, citizens would not have a legal right to view records such as reports about the housing that serves some of Lansing's most vulnerable residents. And issues large and small would remain in the dark. Sarah Lehr is a local government watchdog reporter for the Lansing State Journal.
