Windows 7 Professional 64bit Access 2013 32Bit Office Standard 2013 32Bit I am having a pretty serious issue with my installation of Access 2013.  No matter what I do I can not get the many of the (if not all) of the wizards to work.  None of the Create Wizards work Many of the import/Export data wizards work.  I have tried the following to fix: I am at my wits end here and can not find anything else to try.  Can anybody help me out with this.  I need Access to be working 2 days ago..... Any help would be greatly appreciated! Please let me know if you need any other information.

Which Wizard are you using and what is happening?  Please provide all the steps you taking... oh, are you creating a client/desktop database or a web app? Did this solve your problem ?

In all cases where files are involved I have tried Multiple files and have tried importing them into multiple Desktop Databases. Also one more thing I forgot to mention the first time is that Access always want to configure itself, annoying as it is I would live with it if I could the other stuff working!! I hope this sheds a little more light for you and also gives you some ideas for what may possibly be wrong. Thanks Again!, ~J Did this solve your problem ?

That does not mean just Access it could be more than one version of Office.  So, what was the prior version?  When you installed did you accept the Default Location or did you point it to a new location? I am going to assume you have Tables in your Database?  Does the Table icon have a little globe on it?

Unless you open another version of Access/Office on the same machine it should not do the reinstall.  It only does this when opening different versions on the same machine.  So, right away there is a problem since you uninstalled Office 2000.  Might be there are still remnants and that is interfering with your Access 2013 install. If it were me I would... 1. Confirm Office 2000 and all remnants have been uninstalled 2. Go to the folder where the Wizards are and rename all the extensions to .OLD 3. Run a Repair for Access 2013 making sure to select Custom insuring all the items are confirmed to install (Run from machine). Try again... Did this solve your problem ?

Checked in Programs and Features under the control Panel to be sure there were no old remnants of Office 2000 sticking around and there was nothing.  Renamed the wizards, then ran the repair and still no Dice.  When I start Access It is still doing the configuration step and the wizards still do not work exactly as mentioned above. Is there another way to go back and see if I missed something from the old Office 2000 installation? Did this solve your problem ?             Sorry this didn ' t help.         Great !

Thanks for your feedback. This is baffling... 1. How does Microsoft Access show up under Program  &  Features? 2. Have you ever installed the Access Runtime, any version, on your machine?  If it is still installed you should uninstall and then run the Repair again. 3. Have you tried to navigate to the folder and open Access, MSACCESS.EXE, from there?  Does the same thing happen? Depending on the answer to the above the only other thing that comes to mind is to uninstall completely, reboot and then reinstall. Did this solve your problem ?

I have tried un-install re-install process several times with no success....  Any other ideas? Did this solve your problem ?             Sorry this didn ' t help.         Great !
