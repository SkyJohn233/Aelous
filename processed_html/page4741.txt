Sylvia Travels: Meeting CutiepieMarzia and Pewdiepie at the mall ðŸ™€ðŸ™€ This was first supposed to be me just showing you my day and a little around Malaysia, but then, I bumped into Felix and Marzia!  Here s a really bad picture of me with the amazing couple. I don t have any other pictures but that s alright. I was so overwhelmed, excited, ecstatic, and nervous at the same time. I have been long before and I ve never expected to have a chance to meet them in real life! Oh! If you didn t know Marzia has her own blog that s really amazing. I love the pictures she takes and the content she shares with her subscribers. If you wanna check her blog out; clickÂ  here ! So, my day started out quite bad as I wanted to go to the newest Innisfree outlet opening in KLCC (Kuala Lumpur City Centre). Here s some pictures of KLCC. Initially, I was planning to go there as the new Innisfree was opening, and they had their new cushion sets. Plus, they were giving out free stuff to the first 50 visitors; it was Friday (most people had work and school), so I decided to go. Unfortunately, the jam from my house to KLCC was tremendous, and I ended up not being able to make it to get free things. Oh well. After that, I decided I wanted to buy some false lashes to give them a go. So I visited some drugstores as I don t want to spend too much on them in places like Sephora. Sadly, Ardell isn t sold here, so I just picked up some by Cybercolors which is a Korean brand. I decided to head out to the park to catch some Pokemon. That s when I bumped into my cousin, Jarod. We decided to head to Pavilion as I saw on Facebook a few days back they were getting many lures for their Pokestops. Fast forward a little, after playing Pokemon Go for quite a while, we decided to get some Baskin Robbins  ice cream as they were having a buy 1 free 1 scoop thing going on. After I bought the ice cream, on the way down on the escalator, I saw a guy who looked strangely familiar  Then, I saw Marzia. And, I was freaking out. Literally, hyperventilating. It was just the day before I was watching Marzia s newest video on her channel and I m literally looking at them in real life. I ran up to them quickly and blurted an awkward  hi! Happy anniversary!  and was all  You guys are in Malaysia?! . Felix said they kinda kept it a secret, and at this point, I haven t read Marzia s blog yet so I didn t know this was a trip to celebrate their anniversary. I managed to talk to them for a bit, mostly to Felix, and I was super nervous. MyÂ brain was a wreck, my heart was beating so quickly and I was shaking. They were really friendly, I just wish I were able to tell Marzia she looked amazing, and her dress was so adorable and she is such a big inspiration to me. I felt so lucky to be able to see them and take a picture! GAH! After a while, I told them they should check out Nana s Green Tea which I reviewed the place (clickÂ  here Â to check that out). They said they would and they went along. I was later thinking a bit about asking them if they would like me to show them around a bit as I thought it would be friendly; I figured they probably didn t have friends in Malaysia to show them around. Plus, I was just taking my boyfriend Zac around KL when he was still here (he s back in America now -sniff0). I felt a little embarrassed asking this after I knew that this was supposed to be their romantic vacation later when I was home going through my WordPress feed and reading about Marzia s post about packing. Felix politely declined my offer when I went looking for them the second time; he said that was really nice of me, and Marzia was busy filming again so I didn t manage to talk to her. I just sort of feel really shy and felt like I was invading their privacy to look for them again. I did mention to Felix I hope I wasn t invading and he said it was all good. They were super friendly, I wish I wasn t that nervous and was able to recommend more places and things to try to them when I had the chance. I think I ll just leave it here. Also, this was my first time meeting any sort of celebrity, so it was really an experience. Are any of you fans of Marzia and Felix? I certainly am. Have you met any celebs before? Tell me in the comments! I hope you re having a great day! Cheers! -Sylvia Another award!

Wish that would happen to me, but I live in the Philippines, and I donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll be visiting any time soon!!  Like Liked by  1 person I was shaking! They were in Malaysia for a bit a while back for their anniversary. I was just watching marzia s video like the night before. I met them in a mall I usually go to! I recommended them to check out nana s green tea xD cause I loved the ice cream there and they did cause Marzia filmed it ahhhhh. Maybe they ll go there and keep it secret haha. Try your luck!  Like Liked by  1 person I would have probably froze on the spot and be hesitant for a picture and autograph! They are such a cute couple and I love both channels (I actually found Felix through Marzia and not the other way round!). I will be travelling to Brighton for a day in July, so hopefully they re out and about that day and, who knows, I might be lucky and get a selfie with them ^_^ Like Liked by  1 person I was really nervous and awkward. They re good people! Maybe you ll bump into them (:  Like Like Your email address will not be published.
