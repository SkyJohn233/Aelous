Beri - Savannah Education Trust Beri Banguu sits outside his house in Gberi village and looks at his new school across the grassland. Severely disabled from birth, he once spent his days crawling in the dirt — with little hope for the future. When the school was built in Beri’s village our Programme Manager visited his home to talk to his parents. Beri was thrilled: he had not dared to believe that the school was being built for him. Now he attends everyday and we have been able to provide a wheelchair too. One of our key principles is that our schools should be for everyone, no matter how poor, no matter how disabled. The story of Beri is told in our film,  The Children of Savannah . LIVE 0 00:00 00:35 Tap to Unmute This opens in a new window.
