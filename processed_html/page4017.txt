I had a great experience and would highly recommend training here. \r\n\r\nThe hospital is a nice size such that the medical take is manageable but there is enough going on to keep you busy and interested. Staffing is generally good and there is support from seniors. Trainees seemed generally happy, but I only worked here as an SpR so can't comment on the experience of other grades. \r\n\r\nIn Respiratory medicine, this DGH punches well above its weight. There are specialist clinics in cough and allergy, experience of difficult to treat TB, and well supported training in bronchoscopy and EBUS. Trainees attend the lung cancer MDT at Barts, which provides good training in imaging, pathology and lung cancer management (including access to modern RTX, and trials). The whole department, including specialist nurses, physios etc are dedicated and friendly, making it a really enjoyable job.","reviewRating":{"@type":"rating","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"LJ Smith"}} I worked at Homerton in Respiratory and General Medicine as at ST4.
