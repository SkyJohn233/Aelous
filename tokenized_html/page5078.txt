integrity fundamentals for singapore s governance success article more than just creating honest clean government integrity as wholeness and working together as one united service will ready singapore for the future date posted 6 jul 2018 issue issue 19 8 jul 2018 topics over the past five decades singapore has made good use of its physical and environmental resources to achieve its national outcomes of having a competitive economy sustainable environment and high quality of life 1 however the best of plans can only be realised if certain conditions in the national environment are met without these good plans may never see the light of day projects may get derailed or mismanaged a city might grow but in a haphazard manner hostage to the vagaries of human greed and ambition 2 the foundational condition which allowed independent singapore s urban development plans to bear fruit was the establishment of the rule of law singapore in the 1950s and 60s was rife with crime disorder and corruption moving from that to a society where people submit to the authority of the law rather than having arbitrary decisions of individuals hold sway was not by far the natural inclination of the system it took a costly and intentional shift since the very beginning of singapore s independence the ruling people s action party pap has staked its reputation on running a clean and honest government free of corruption rooting out corruption was crucial in establishing the rule of law for this political will at the highest levels was vital through the decades the pap government has been consistent in its absolute intolerance for corruption early on in singapore s independence the corrupt practices investigation bureau cpib was strengthened with new legislation giving cpib officers additional powers to investigate and arrest penalities for corruption were also increased such as mandating the repayment of bribes as fines to signal the importance placed by the political leadership on anti-corruption efforts the cpib reports directly to the prime minister as a matter of practice no one is above the law no matter their status cabinet ministers have been successfully tried for corruption alongside rank-and-file public officers punishment has been and remains swift serious and public in 1970s wee toon boon then minister of state for environment was found to have used his ministerial status to favour a property developer in 1970s wee toon boon then minister of state for environment was found to have used his ministerial status to favour a property developer in return he had received property a free trip and funds amounting to over s 800,000 wee was charged in 1975 and later convicted for corruption in late 1986 then minister for national development teh cheang wan was investigated for accepting bribes amounting to s 1 million in return for helping property developers to retain or acquire state land teh initially denied wrongdoing but later tried to strike a bargain with the cpib and even sought to meet then prime minister lee kuan yew who rejected his request days before he could be formally charged in court teh took his own life and left behind a letter expressing his remorse a committee of inquiry later concluded that the cpib had uncovered misdeeds which would have remained unknown if not for the thoroughness and diligence of their investigations on the conviction of high-profile political leaders the late mr lee kuan yew commented it is easy to start off with high moral standards strong convictions and determination to beat down corruption but it is difficult to live up to these good intentions unless the leaders are strong and determined enough to deal with all transgressors without exceptions cpib officers must be supported without fear or favour to enforce the rules 3 in 1994 the cpib started investigating the case of choy hon tim a former deputy chief executive operations of the public utilities board pub in 1994 the cpib started investigating the case of choy hon tim a former deputy chief executive operations of the public utilities board pub who was found to have accepted bribes to assist a sub-contractor doing work for pub on several occasions choy hon tim fled the country but was eventually brought back to singapore and charged on 27 october 1995 for criminal conspiracy and accepting bribes totalling around s 13.85 million he was sentenced to prison for 14 years to date the total sum choy received remains the largest total amount of bribe monies received by a public official in singapore s history maintaining integrity in singapore in general and in the civil service in particular was never just a matter of going on the offensive against corruption but also about looking to the constructive task of institution-building since its formation in 1951 the public service commission psc has been the custodian of the values of integrity impartiality and meritocracy for the public service as an independent and neutral body overseeing appointments promotions and discipline within the service the psc plays a key role in ensuring that the civil service remains both clean and effective then deputy prime minister and finance minister lee hsien long summed it up thus the psc is a critical component of the civil service system it is basically there to guarantee the integrity of the civil service it is there to give the reassurance to the public that the civil service is being properly managed that there is no nepotism no monkey business going on and it gives the reassurance to the civil servants that their position is secured and they won t be subject to political interference 4 the founding generation of political leaders left a deep impression on the culture of the public service in the first instance integrity was understood as honesty and incorruptibility but when speaking of a culture of integrity which enables good governance we must not forget that habits of mind are also a manifestation of that culture another aspect of integrity when applied to policymaking is intellectual honesty this means looking problems in the face and solving them using policies chosen not based on ideology but on a hard-nosed assessment of the likely results when pursued as a consistent practice this manifests as an unsentimental pragmatism in singapore s history and in the minds of our founding generation of leaders this results-oriented approach to policymaking was linked to the drive for clean and honest government and against corruption a pragmatic focus on results would l ead to the efficient provision of services to the public this in turn would remove the incentive for corruption if citizens could consistently enjoy efficient and effective services then there would be no need to resort to bribery to get things done this approach to policymaking variously described as rational pragmatic unsentimental and results-oriented 5 has become a hallmark of the singapore public service s approach to governance an extension of this results-oriented approach to policymaking is the habit of thinking again both successes and failures in public policy and being willing to confront the performance either good or bad of existing policies so as to rework them to obtain better results 6 intellectual honesty can only bear fruit where there is courage to speak thus willingness to speak truth to power is also part of the public service s culture of integrity carefully nurtured over the years once a policy is decided working with the elected government to serve the people of singapore and shape singapore s future means that civil servants will put their full efforts behind implementing the policy well but in the preceding process of formulating policy civil servants are encouraged to speak their minds as they develop options robustly defend their divergent views and push options which their supervisors may well disagree with we believe that the best ideas surface when our diverse 145,000-strong public service are empowered to speak and make a difference to policy directions singapore has earned its international reputation for clean government based on available anti-corruption metrics singapore is doing well at the same time there is a global trend of declining public trust in governments with growing distrust of elites in the 2018 edelman trust barometer the global level of public trust in governments was only 43 singapore was one of only a handful of countries classified by edelman as enjoying high trust to maintain public trust in a shifting and increasingly complex environment the public service can not simply continue to do only the same things it has always done in the same way it has always done them peter ho former head of civil service and current senior advisor to the centre for strategic futures at the prime minister s office recently observed that the balance of public trust has shifted away from institutions and towards individuals as people choose to believe peers in their social circles rather than experts or the authorities 8 in such an environment ensuring that the government has the institutional and legal safeguards in place robustly to refute falsehoods is only one part of the answer 9 a second equally important part has to do with the how of delivering public services we must ensure that the public service is prepared to function less hierarchically and more transparently in an environment of greater contestation and scrutiny it must learn to gain trust by sharing information and sometimes admitting to not knowing even as it continues to serve citizens with heart with passion empathy and care to engage in transformational change while maintaining our bearings remaining connected to our values is key to this end the singapore public service s core values of integrity service and excellence must continue to guide all aspects of our work even as we transform how we do that work as technology accentuates the complexity of cities as systems every government must confront complexity well in order for their country to flourish governments that make the effort to understand and manage complexity will gain a competitive advantage 10 but how is a government to do this we have looked at integrity as honesty in the form of clean government and in terms of intellectual honesty when faced with policy problems another aspect of integrity is wholeness undividedness this is particularly key in a constantly changing and complex operating environment where the public service needs to organise itself to respond nimbly to changing circumstances one of the mantras of singapore s public sector transformation 11 effort is accomplishing the singapore agenda as one public service the idea is that in every aspect of building singapore the public service will emphasise alignment across all public agencies as one public service so that our efforts are coordinated and not fragmented in a complex world where everything is interconnected and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for solving the big urban challenges of the day whole-of-government integrated policymaking and implementation has become an imperative and an essential antidote to the dangers of reductionism this is not just relevant to urban governance but also has broader application to all sorts of modern problems whether it is confronting terrorism or regulating airborne personal vehicles or thinking about the ethics of regulating autonomous vehicles many modern challenges fall outside existing organisational boundaries they tend to involve multiple dimensions security social economic seamless whole-of-government coordination gives us our best chance of addressing these challenges well the one public service whole-of-government philosophy of the singapore public service is an important competitive advantage for getting singapore ready for the future a vivid picture of this can be seen in the nationwide 3d mapping initiative led by the singapore land authority but involving multiple agencies pub caas govtech nparks and ura this project put together the most comprehensive geospatial dataset ever collected in singapore including buildings roads terrain water bodies vegetation tunnels and bridges the comprehensive 3d map data has provided a rigorous geospatial foundation for policymakers to develop solutions for complex urban challenges more effectively and has applications in flood management flight planning and airspace safety assessment tree management as well as applications in studying potential solar energy harnessing among others the rapid advance of technology has fundamentally changed the nature of service delivery every public agency is having to think again about what it means to serve citizens going digital to the core is a key part of the singapore public service s transformation plan our goal of making singapore a smart nation has widespread implications for the practice of governance with sharing data across the public service as the default practice and by fully exploiting available data for the good of the citizen initiatives like moments of life a digital platform that anticipates when citizens require government services based on significant events at different life stages become possible 12 services that used to be bricks-and-mortar infrastructure affairs such as housing the population will need to be part of an integrated suite of anticipatory services offered to citizens at appropriate junctures this is a departure from traditional approaches where agencies dealingwith urban development have tended to be single-issue focused the housing and development board for instance was set up to tackle the issue of housing singapore s growing population in the early days of independence re-conceiving of its mission as just one piece of the wider goal of serving every citizen through his/her different stages of life is a transformation a re-imagining of how we should serve citizens when we put them at the centre with the conviction that rigid and siloed thinking is fatal in a complex and changing world the singapore public service will need to continually demonstrate our willingness to review rules and processes to facilitate progress even as we preserve our commitment to clean government both aspects of integrity integrity as honest clean government and integrity as wholeness and making progress as one unified service must be upheld in order for our public service to succeed in its mission of serving singapore with excellence into the future about the author ng li sa is director of the public service commission secretariat ong toon hui is
