Style to the Airport - Review of Aerofleet Services, Toronto, Canada - TripAdvisor I asked for a quotation from the Pearson Int ' l Airport to Oshawa. $75.The final charge was $93.00... read more I booked a day ahead assuming for a 5:30 AM pick up they ' d be on time.  WRONG !  They were 15 mins... read more Great Service. On time and beautiful Limo to take us to the airport for our Vacation. We had 0 issues and would definitely use again. The Price of $55.00 was good considering a taxi would cost more from our location to the airport. When I called I was kept on hold for three minutes and then cut off. I eventually got back to them they sent a car to the terminal one prearranged area. I was waiting inside. I waited for 15 minutes. The driver didn't bother to come inside to the desk. He then drove away. It's a dreadful service We used Aerofleet services twice during our stay in Toronto. >Both times the drivers were very professional and smart, the cars were comfortable and clean.  The drivers took our cases to put in the car making our journey hassle free.<br >Our return journey was booked online 24 hours earlier and the car arrived on time. >There must be many taxi companies in Toronto but I can fully recommend Aerofleet as they provide a professional service at a affordable price.< p> Date of experience:  May 2016 Ask sarahpWiltshire about Aerofleet Services Thank sarahpWiltshire  This review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC minao2014 Paris, France 38 9 Reviewed 26 August 2016  Google Translation
