Unable to unlock Coral Orchestra for Palico? : MonsterHunterWorld I don’t remember fighting 3 protectors riding on shamos but when I go to high rank Coral Highlands I found them in the cave, yet I am unable to really talk to them and receive the quest. I tried to look at the quest board to see if I already have the quest but no luck there. Anyone know what’s going on? Do I need to collect more doodle instead? Strange. The event doesn &# x27;t start till you kill the 3 shamos riding Palicos. I &# x27;d say reload the area, and try again. The Palicos won &# x27;t be in a cave, and more than likely it was just some wandering palicos from another area. Once you &# x27;ve killed the 3 shamos Palicos, you should receive a quest to kill 2 Tzi-ti-Ya-Ku. I hope this helped. If you have any questions, feel free to ask ^ ^ Ah right I just realized those three cats are random palicos ahahah, thank you very much!!!! :D 298k Members 5.2k Online Jun 10, 2017 Cake Day
