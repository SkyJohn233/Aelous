the close button this is a modal window this modal can be closed by pressing the escape key or activating the close button former stoke city striker dave kitson has pulled off the coup of landing a weekly column in the sun the first of which dredged up an episode from back in february 2010 but how on earth did he persuade the sun to employ his services agent hello is that the sun sports desk sun yes how can i help agent i represent dave kitson sun oh yes remember him great career with derby newcastle and leicester agent not paul kitson dave kitson sun dave agent yes dave cambridge reading portsmouth sun cambridge agent and stoke city when tony pulis was manager sun oh yes agent i d like you to give him a weekly column sun right well with all due respect he s er he s not much of a name is he agent you do know he hated pulis and his time at stoke sun rings a very distant bell go on agent well dave wouldn t be averse to slagging him off for you particularly in his first column sun pulis baiting hmm been done to death really my old fruit agent dave would quite happily say that stoke s nastiness was down to pulis sun getting warmer but still not sure that would cut it to be honest i mean stoke no-one cares now they aren t in the premier league agent dave has plenty to get off his chest sun you mean a bitter axe to grind agent call it what you like but your readers will love it sun stoke city though agent he ll kick off by saying pulis was ultimately responsible for aaron ramsey s sun aaron ramsey you mean arsenal agent yes sun well why didn t you say when can you and dave pop in to see us agent we re parked outside sun but let s not rush things let s think through the consquences agent such as sun well is it fair on the guy who broke his leg what was his name ray ryan agent shawcross oh don t worry about him arsenal fans hate him even after all these years sun yes they do don t they i think we might have a deal agent i think we gunner have some fun sun as long as dave doesn t mind hitting the target agent oh yes he s quite good at that now he s stopped playing
