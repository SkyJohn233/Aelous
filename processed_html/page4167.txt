Evidence-Based Investing (EBI) involves the judicious use of current                      best evidence and applies the available evidence to each investor’s specific needs and challenges to formulate optimal investing solutions. The goal of EBI is to maximize after-tax returns for the individual investor while minimizing                      risk and protecting portfolios from market downturns. Our investment management services are designed to engineer broad, globally diversified portfolios that minimize risk and maximize after-tax return.

The second purpose of EBI is to enhance the investor/adviser relationship by revisiting the individual’s goals and personal situation, thus increasing the likelihood of optimal gains in the future. To this end, EBI offers a way to                      answer investment questions in a systematic, analytical, and scientific manner.
