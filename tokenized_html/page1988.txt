new ev battery trailer from ebuggy leads to cheaper evs published on september 19th 2012 by tina casey september 19th 2012 by tina casey if electric vehicle batteries are the single most expensive obstacle to making evs more affordable then one solution is to ditch the battery right well almost a german company called ebuggy has come up with an ev battery trailer called ebuggy what else the trailer arrangement enables car buyers to go for a relatively low-cost ev with a small lightweight battery for local driving where range is not an issue to go on a long trip all they have to do is stop by the local ebuggy station hitch up a trailer with a much larger battery and bob s your uncle though driving around with a trailer is not everyone s cup of tea between private owners the commercial sector and government/non-government organizations there is probably plenty of market to support something like ebuggy for that matter the ebuggy concept is familiar territory to the millions of u.s. drivers who routinely hitch u-hauls campers boats and bike trailers to their cars as a one-off range extender the trailer concept is pretty simple it only takes a couple of minutes to hook up which makes it at least as quick and convenient as going over to the local gas station and filling the tank for a long trip for even longer trips ebuggy envisions a network of relay stations where ev drivers can drop off a spent trailer and hitch up a fresh one also within just a couple of minutes that makes things a bit more complicated but it wouldn t necessarily put a crimp on the market in fact the ev battery relay/exchange concept is already starting to take hold as an alternative to charging stations the ev battery company better place for example has been ramping up the introduction of a fully automated drive-through experience where ev owners can switch out their spent batteries in a matter of minutes rather than waiting around for a recharge in terms of ev design the ebuggy concept offers a higher degree of leeway to ev manufacturers which would be freed up to devote more talent on developing super lightweight inexpensive evs for local driving rather than having to accommodate larger heavier batteries the folks at ebuggy also point out that the trailer concept provides a two-for-one deal by providing ev owners with both a short-range and a long-range option in one car another option would be to buy that tiny new emo from tata and rent a larger car for long-distance drives but that could prove to be a lot more expensive than simply hooking up an ev battery trailer whenever you need it that tight focus on affordability and flexibility is no accident as ebuggy evidently has its eye on the personal mobility revolution under way in enormous new markets like china and india as well as western markets where consumers are thirsting for more economical options if u.s. car manufacturers want to compete for those customers they are not going up against a lone company called ebuggy they will be butting heads with a full-scale public-private collaborative effort by germany that includes a grant from the federal ministry of economics and technology along with the participation of companies aera gmbh muhlhausen germany bvb innovate gmbh stuttgart germany and hb technologies ag tubingen germany as well as the isw institute of the university of stuttgart unfortunately back here in the u.s. a certain presidential candidate continues to push the i built this whole thing all by myself fantasy which certainly does no good for the u.s. business community except maybe in your dreams image ebuggy ev battery trailer courtesy of ebuggy follow me on twitter tinamcasey follow cleantechnica on google news it will make you happy help you live in peace for the rest of your life tags affordable ev ebuggy ebuggy ev battery ebuggy trailer ev battery stations lightweight ev long range ev long range ev battery low cost ev tata emo tina casey specializes in military and corporate sustainability advanced technology emerging materials biofuels and water and wastewater issues tina s articles are reposted frequently on reuters scientific american and many other sites views expressed are her own follow her on twitter tinamcasey and google+ advertise with cleantechnica to get your company in front of millions of monthly readers the content produced by this site is for entertainment purposes only opinions and comments published on this site may not be sanctioned by and do not necessarily represent the views of sustainable enterprises media inc. its owners sponsors affiliates or subsidiaries cleantechnica is the 1 cleantech-focused news analysis website in the us the world focusing primarily on electric cars solar energy wind energy energy storage 2019 sustainable enterprises media inc
