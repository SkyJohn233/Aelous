Any places in the Sioux Empire that are good for urban exploration? : SiouxFalls Fire away! Not really. If you &# x27;re looking for abandoned or intricate buildings I spent a lot of time as a teenager looking for cool buildings downtown and climbing a few and I wouldn &# x27;t say I found anything remotely worth going out of my way for. The best  " urban "  exploration in South Dakota is actually rural.  Abandoned farm houses can harbor great caches of interesting finds.  We take trespassing super seriously here, though; and I &# x27;d imagine there &# x27;s some danger that the landowner won &# x27;t  " take kindly "  to your presence.  Only you can decide what you &# x27;re going to do and not going to do, but please always consider what you may risk. >A much less risky way to urbex is to gain lawful access to a building.  Sometimes that&#x27;s taking some extra time to find the owner of the building you want to explore and asking permission.  Sometimes (and this is my favorite) you can enter a public, or semi-public, building and just walk around - no reason you <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">have< strong> to go in and out just because your business is completed. :) This is why we had to demolish the house my grandpa grew up in, idiot kids kept breaking in and we were told if we didn &# x27;t demolish it we would be liable if anyone were injured on the property. I would not recommend abandoned farmsteads. There are lots of opportunities for breaking through floors, exposed nails, wild (possibly rabid) animals, broken glass, and rusty debris. There’s a reason they’re abandoned.  Maybe look around, but I wouldn’t go in. I hear the abandoned Old Main building at Augustana is cool, but you &# x27;d have to be very sneaky to get in. Not in the Sioux Falls area but San Haven Sanitarium in North Dakota is awesome. You’d almost have to spend the night in Bismarck or Minot I don &# x27;t know if you &# x27;re looking for NOT geocaching, but there are a lot of active caches around Sioux Falls, and that might help get you into some new nooks and crannies. 4.5k Members 21 Online Apr 3, 2011 Cake Day
