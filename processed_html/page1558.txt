Candy Crush Saga All Help: Candy Crush Saga Level 2481 Tips and video Got through with only one booster. Amazing. Easy one for a change. 3 stars first attempt. Don ' t know if it was a lucky board but I did it first try, no boosters, 3 stars. Nice once in a while! Really fun level! No boosters needed.  Posting for luck... A fun level but after trying a few times, I only needed one more hit on a popcorn so used a lollipop - however lollipop wouldnt work on the popcorn!! only on the candies, so lost the game! Lollipops can hit anything on the board including popcorn. Maybe you needed 2 hits on the popcorn? Fun one!  Took a few tries, but 3 stars, no boosters. Thanks for all the help. Best posters ever! I d have committed myself years ago if it wasn t for the help! I m still a sucker. That s how King Kong survives  It is fun, but I ' m not finding it to be easy!  Unfortunately today, starting on this level we seem to have to cope with convulsion inducing  " bouncing "  candies which appear to try to get you to make your next move really quickly. Made me feel sick and I can no longer play it. Well done CC.....
