getting state update from zwave rfid reader z-wave home assistant community got myself a zipato rfid reader same as schlage/benext to be used by my cleaning lady all my normal home/away/alarm functionality is driven by automations and mainly based on presence detection of phones movement so the panel only needs to be used by people not part of the normal household but own a rfid tag from me problem as such ozw supports this device but my issue is that this device for some reason does not seem to support setting it s state by the controller this means it can arm/disarm my alarm based on the tags but i can not set the panel to arm/disarm by the controller this means there is a big risk the panel and my alarm modes get out of sync and then the cleaning lady comes again after a few days house mode is away and alarm is also in away mode she enters but a using her correct rfid tag will have no effect as the panel is still in disarm mode so no state change with alarm still in away alarm will soundâ€¦ some ideas but no idea how to do so i would like to see when a correct rfid tag is used even if the panel is already in disarm mode as you can see in below log dump the device reports correctly that it is disarmed again by sending again access control event:6 status=255 unfortunately i don t know how to catch this updated change even tough the status is identical vs previous state does not even report a lastupdate the issue is that this does not generate a state change in hass also no change in the lastupdated states.sensor.schlage_link_mini_keypad_rfid_access_control_29_9.last_updated question does anyone know how i can catch this in hass if it helps i have been working with the zipato too small write up here basic home alarm setup with zipato keypad powered by discourse best viewed with javascript enabled
