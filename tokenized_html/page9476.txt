expressions common and natural logs a logarithm can have any positive value as its base but two log bases are more useful than the others the base- 10 or common log is popular for historical reasons and is usually written as log x for instance ph the measure of a substance 's acidity or alkalinity decibels the measure of sound intensity and the richter scale the measure of earthquake intensity all involve base- 10 logs if a log has no base written you should generally in algebra classes assume that the base is 10 the other important log is the natural or base- e log denoted as ln x and usually pronounced as ell-enn-of- x note that 's ell-enn not one-enn or eye-enn just as the number e arises naturally in math and the sciences so also does the natural log which is why you need to be familiar with it warning if you eventually progress to much-more advanced mathematics you may find that sometimes log x means the base- e log or even base- 2 log rather than the common log because the common and natural logs are pretty much the only logs that are used in real life these are the only two for which you have calculator keys make sure you know where these keys are and how to use them aside why would the natural log be denoted by ln rather than by nl one popular idea relates to euler oy-lur the guy who discovered invented the natural exponential euler was swiss and spoke french so he might have called the function le logarithme naturel rather than the natural log in which case ln makes sense however history shows that euler actually used just l x for the logarithm using his number e as its base advertisement the first published use of the ln notation for the base- e logarithm was stringham 's in his 1893 text uniplanar algebra prof. stringham was an american so i have no idea why he would have used the notation ln other than perhaps to reflect a common though mistaken idea that napier 's log was a base- e log that is ln might have meant to stand for log of napier it is even possible that the ln notation is a mistake a european mathematician once proposed abbreviating log as lg and then using a script l for the function with effectively a little squiggle afterwards which was meant to indicate a subscripted italic g but in the graphic i 've seen the g looks much more like an n some of the other proposed notations for the natural logarithm were even more odd mercator not the map guy used a latin form of the term log naturalis in his 1668 book on logarithms and as of the late 1800s various english-speakers were using the notation log.nat. for the natural logarithm in short the origin of this notation seems somewhat obscure perhaps even unknown which is unusual for such a recent invention since 100 10 2 then log 100 log 10 2 2 because log 100 y means 10 y 100 10 2 so y 2 log 100 2 plug log 100 into your calculator and you 'll get the same answer since 98 is not a nice neat power of 10 the way that 100 was i can not be clever with exponents to arrive at an exact answer on this exercise i am stuck with using my calculator to get an approximate value so i 'll plug this into my calculator remembering to use the log key not the ln key and i get log 98 1.99122607569 or log 98 1.99 rounded to two decimal places remember that ln means the base- e log so ln e 4.5 might be thought of as log e e 4.5 the relationship says that ln e 4.5 y means e y e 4.5 so y 4.5 and ln e 4.5 4.5 plug ln e 4.5 into your calculator and you 'll get the same answer make sure you put parentheses around the e 4.5 so the calculator knows that the exponent is inside the log since 2 is a nice neat whole number and since e is n't then it is unlikely that 2 is a nice neat power of e so i ca n't simplify this expression by being clever with exponents instead i 'll have to evaluate this in my calculator getting an approximate answer of ln 2 0.69314718056 or ln 2 0.69 rounded to two decimal places the graph of a logarithm looks similar to that of a square root however the square-root graph stops at the point 0 0 while the logarithm graph does not pass through the origin but instead passes through 1 0 and then continues down along the right-hand positive side of the y -axis since the log function is the inverse of the exponential function the graph of the log is the flip of the graph of the exponential the exponential rides along the top of the x -axis crosses the y -axis at the point 0 1 and then shoots up the logarithm rides up the right side of the y -axis crosses the x -axis at the point 1 0 and then shoots right for more information
