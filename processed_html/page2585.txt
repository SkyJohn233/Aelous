Showing compassion for one’s neighbor and Christian brothers is a basic requirement of those who strive to imitate Jesus. ( John 13:34, 35 ) One meaning of compassion is “to suffer together.” A person who shows compassion is moved to relieve others’ suffering, perhaps by helping them out of their difficulties. Seek opportunities to do so! The sufferings of those struck by disasters move many to manifest compassion. Jehovah’s people are known for coming forward to help in such times of need. ( 1 Pet. 2:17 ) One Japanese sister lived in an area that was seriously damaged by the earthquake and tsunami of 2011. She says that she was “very encouraged and comforted” by the efforts of the many volunteers from elsewhere in Japan and from overseas to repair property damage. She writes: “This experience helped me to realize that Jehovah cares. And fellow Witnesses care about one another. Many brothers and sisters all over the world are praying for us.”  w17.09  11 ¶12-13 Song 55  and Prayer   Opening Comments (3 min. or less) “ Do Not Fear the Fearsome Beasts ”:  (10 min.)
