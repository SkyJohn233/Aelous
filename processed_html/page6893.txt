I just wanted to check if there is any disadvantages if I choose a AMD CPU and a Nvidia GPU. Is it faster/ more stable to use both a AMD CPU and GPU? No advantages or disadvantages either way. I have an 1800x with a GTX 1070 and zero issues.  PSU Tier List Thread   "White Ice" Ryzen 7 3700x | Asus Crosshair VI Hero | EVGA RTX 2080ti Black | Flare X 16-16-16-32 3600mhz 16gb | Full Custom Water Cooling Loop | 1tb Samsung 970 Evo Samsung 850 evo 250gb | 2x 3tb Seagate Drive | Fractal Design Meshify S2 |  EVGA G2 750w PSU | 2x Corsair LL140 | 3x Corsair LL120   Dedicated Streaming Rig Ryzen 7 1800x | Asrock B450M Pro 4 | 16gb G.Skill Flare X 3200mhz | EVGA B3 450w | EVGA GTX 1060 3gb | 250gb 860 Evo m.2 | Phanteks Enthoo Evolv | Elgato HD60 Pro | Elgato 4k60 Pro mk.2    You need to be a member in order to leave a comment Sign up for a new account in our community.
