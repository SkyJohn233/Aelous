That’s right, you heard correctly; you aren t required to write the Essay anymore! But wait, this begs the question:  should you take it  or skip it? Will colleges think less of your SAT score if you choose to skip the Essay? It’s best to consult you college advisor(s) and the contacts you’ve made at your potential schools. They can answer any question you might have about the school (and the requirements for getting into it!),  so don’t hesitate to ask. The new SAT is graded out of 1600 points. Let’s compare. The  current SAT  has  three  sections scored from 200 to 800 ( Math ,  Reading , and  Writing ) for a grand total of  2400 possible points . Well, breathe a sigh in relief. The  new SAT  only has  two  sections! A new  Evidence based Reading and Writing  section, a nd, of course, good old  Mathematics .  These  two  sections are graded from 200 to 800, giving us the  400 to 1600 figure  (fun fact: pre 2005, the SAT was graded out of 1600, so it’s  actually  retro).  You know what that means— the fewer sections there are, the less you ve got to worry about! On the new SAT, the Essay is an entirely different animal. The time allotment for the Essay, should you choose to take it, has been boosted from 25 to 50 minutes. So there must be some differences, right? Let’s look at how The College Board describes it. They describe the current SAT Essay as “ Students [taking] a position on a presented issue”  — while the new one they describe as  “Students [producing] a written analysis of a provided source text.” The new Essay is an analytical response, rather than an open-ended opinion piece. Personally, I like this change. The current Essay can catch students off guard with prompts they may not be familiar with. The new Essay will provide you with all the source material you need for a great response. This is a big one: you are no longer penalized for getting a wrong answer. In the majority of the  current SAT , you  lose 1/4 of a point  for a getting a wrong answer. In the  new SAT ,  you don’t lose any points for a wrong answer . There is no ambiguity as to whether or not you should guess! You should guess. You should  always,  definitely,  guess!  Leave no questions unanswered. That’s a quick overview of the  new  SAT  and some of the major changes. Be sure to  get the low down on the official College Board website.  Also, remember to take a  practice test  so you re prepared on test day. Good luck in uncharted territory! You’re going where no student has gone before; you will be the first students to  ever  take the  new  SAT .
