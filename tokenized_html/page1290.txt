continuous and hard muscle training engage in stringent dietetic manipulations the first few months of hypercaloric nutrition rich in proteins are devoted to the build-up of muscle mass a second phase of reduced caloric intake is designed reduce subcutaneous fat while during the last week of preparations extreme carbohydrate intake aims at loading muscles with glycogen simultaneously sodium and water restriction results in extracellular and therefore subcutaneous volume deficit and better definition of muscle contours and structure in the course of these dietetic manipulations a young body

fujita toshiro uchida shunya shibata shigeru 2017-05-01 aldosterone plays an important role in regulating na-cl reabsorption and blood pressure epithelial na channel na -cl cotransporter and cl /hco 3 exchanger pendrin are the major mediators of na-cl transport in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron existing evidence also suggests that plasma k concentration affects renal na-cl handling in this study we posited that hypokalemia modulates the effects of aldosterone on pendrin in hyperaldosteronism chronic aldosterone infusion in mice increased pendrin levels at the plasma membrane and correcting hypokalemia in this model almost completely blocked pendrin upregulation however hypokalemia induced by a low-k diet resulted in pendrin downregulation along with reduced plasma aldosterone levels indicating that both hypokalemia and aldosterone excess are necessary for pendrin induction in contrast decreased plasma k levels were sufficient to increase na -cl cotransporter levels we found that phosphorylation of mineralocorticoid receptor that prevents aldosterone binding in intercalated cells was suppressed by hypokalemia which resulted in enhanced pendrin response to aldosterone explaining the coordinated action of aldosterone and hypokalemia in pendrin regulation finally to address the physiological significance of our observations we administered aldosterone to mice lacking pendrin notably plasma k levels were significantly lower in pendrin knockout mice 2.7±0.1 mmol/l than in wild-type mice 3.0±0.1 mmol/l after aldosterone infusion demonstrating that pendrin alleviates hypokalemia in a state of aldosterone excess these data indicate that the decreased plasma k levels promote pendrin induction by aldosterone which in concert with na -cl cotransporter counteracts the progression of hypokalemia but promotes hypertension in primary aldosterone excess © 2017 american heart association inc. hypokalemia and agitation in acute psychotic patients pubmed hatta k takahashi t nakamura h yamashiro h asukai n yonezawa y 1999-04-19 hypokalemia is caused partly by intensive exercise some evidence suggests that psychological distress may cause hypokalemia the relationship between the decline of serum potassium concentration and the level of symptoms of acute agitation which was defined as a total score on a subset of six categories on the 18-item brief psychiatric rating scale anxiety tension mannerism and posturing hostility uncooperativeness psychomotor excitement was examined in 313 schizophrenic men admitted on an emergency basis during a 24-month period in addition change in serum potassium concentration after sedation was investigated serum potassium concentration in the severely agitated group was lower than that in the mild group there was a significant correlation between serum potassium concentration and the level of symptoms of acute agitation r -0.30 p 0.0001 although the decline of serum potassium concentration in the patients who were sufficiently sedated improved within 8 h that in the patients showing high scores on the acute agitation subset even 8 h after emergency admission was prolonged results indicate that sedation improves acute agitation-induced hypokalemia rights hypokalemia causing rhabdomyolysis in a patient with short bowel syndrome pubmed balhara kamna s highet bridget omron rodney 2015-04-01 rhabdomyolysis usually in the setting of trauma or drug use is frequently seen in the emergency setting and often leads to hyperkalemia at presentation hypokalemia however is a potentially underrecognized cause of rhabdomyolysis we present a case of rhabdomyolysis likely due to hypokalemia in the setting of short bowel syndrome why should an emergency physician be aware of this although less common hypokalemia can be a significant cause of rhabdomyolysis via its effects on muscle this scenario should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients at risk for hypokalemia who present with weakness rapid recognition of this relationship and rapid correction of hypokalemia may prove very important in preventing the deleterious effects of rhabdomyolysis

matsunoshita natsuki yamamura tomohiko minamikawa shogo ninchoji takeshi morisada naoya nakanishi koichi kaito hiroshi iijima kazumoto 2016-04-01 autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 adh1 is a relatively rare endocrine disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and inadequate parathyroid hormone secretion adh is caused by activating mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor casr gene casr casr plays a crucial role in calcium and magnesium homeostasis in the kidney adh may be accompanied by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis when it is classified as type v bartter syndrome however the mechanism underlying hypokalemia in this disease is unclear we investigated a 33-year-old woman with hypocalcemia and hypoparathyroidism since childhood whose mother also had hypocalcemia and hypoparathyroidism but with no clinical symptoms blood examinations showed hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis in the patient but not her mother we conducted mutation analysis and diuretic tests to clarify the patient 's and her mother 's diagnosis and to investigate the onset mechanism of hypokalemia in adh1 we also determined the localization of casr in the kidney by immunohistochemistry we detected a known gain-of-function mutation in casr in both the patient and her mother diuretic tests revealed a response to furosemide and no reaction to thiazide in the patient although the mother responded well to both diuretics casr co-localized with the na -cl cotransporter ncct on distal tubular epithelial cells these results indicate that the ncct in the distal convoluted tubule was secondarily affected in this patient we conclude that the main pathogenesis of secondary hypokalemia in adh1 in this patient was secondary ncct dysfunction severe metabolic alkalosis following

are numerous but endocrinal causes are rare we report a case of a patient with severe respiratory insufficiency metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia the evolution was fatal further explorations revealed an ectopic adrenocorticotropine hormone syndrome the initial tumor was probably a small cell lung carcinoma life-threatening hypokalemia following rapid correction of respiratory acidosis pubmed hammond kendra you david collins eileen g leehey david j laghi franco 2013-01-01 a 56-year-old woman with a history of paraplegia and chronic pain due to neuromyelitis optica devic 's syndrome was admitted to a spinal cord injury unit for management of a sacral decubitus ulcer during the hospitalization she required emergency transfer to the intensive care unit icu because of progressive deterioration of respiratory muscle function severe respiratory acidosis obtundation and hypotension upon transfer to the icu arterial blood gas revealed severe acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis ph 7.00 pco2 120 mm hg po2 211 mm hg the patient was immediately intubated and mechanically ventilated intravenous fluid boluses of normal saline 10.5 l in about 24 h and vasopressors were started with rapid correction of hypotension in addition she was given hydrocortisone within 40 min of initiation of mechanical ventilation there was improvement in acute respiratory acidosis sixteen hours later however the patient developed life-threatening hypokalemia k of 2.1 meq/l and hypomagnesemia mg of 1.4 mg/dl despite aggressive potassium supplementation hypokalemia continued to worsen over the next several hours k of 1.7 meq/l urine studies revealed renal potassium wasting we reason that the recalcitrant life-threatening hypokalemia was caused by several mechanisms including total body potassium depletion chronic respiratory acidosis a shift of potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space rapid correction of respiratory acidosis with mechanical ventilation increased sodium delivery to the distal nephron normal saline resuscitation hyperaldosteronism secondary to hypotension plus administration of hydrocortisone and hypomagnesemia we conclude that rapid correction of respiratory acidosis especially in the setting of hypotension can lead to life-threatening hypokalemia serum potassium levels must be monitored closely in these patients as failure to do so can lead to potentially lethal consequences intercalated cell-specific rh b glycoprotein deletion diminishes renal ammonia excretion response to hypokalemia pubmed central bishop jesse m. lee hyun-wook handlogten mary e. han ki-hwan verlander jill w. 2013-01-01 the ammonia transporter family member rh b glycoprotein rhbg is an ammonia-specific transporter heavily expressed in the kidney and is necessary for the normal increase in ammonia excretion in response to metabolic acidosis hypokalemia is a common clinical condition in which there is increased renal ammonia excretion despite the absence of metabolic acidosis the purpose of this study was to examine rhbg 's role in this response through the use of mice with intercalated cell-specific rhbg deletion ic-rhbg-ko hypokalemia induced by feeding a k+-free diet increased urinary ammonia excretion significantly in mice with intact rhbg expression hypokalemia increased rhbg protein expression in intercalated cells in the cortical collecting duct ccd and in the outer medullary collecting duct omcd deletion of rhbg from intercalated cells inhibited hypokalemia -induced changes in urinary total ammonia excretion significantly and completely prevented hypokalemia -induced increases in urinary ammonia concentration but did not alter urinary ph we conclude that hypokalemia increases rhbg expression in intercalated cells in the cortex and outer medulla and that intercalated cell rhbg expression is necessary for the normal increase in renal ammonia excretion in response to hypokalemia pmid:23220726 hyperkalemia and hypokalemia in ckd prevalence risk factors and clinical outcomes pubmed gilligan sarah raphael kalani l 2017-09-01 abnormalities of serum potassium are common in patients with ckd

gruffydd-jones timothy j. malik richard cortes alejandro jones boyd r. helps chris r. prinzenberg eva m. erhardt george lyons leslie a 2012-01-01 burmese is an old and popular cat breed however several health concerns such as hypokalemia and a craniofacial defect are prevalent endangering the general health of the breed hypokalemia a subnormal serum potassium ion concentration k+ most often occurs as a secondary problem but can occur as a primary problem such as hypokalaemic periodic paralysis in humans and as feline hypokalaemic periodic polymyopathy primarily in burmese the most characteristic clinical sign of hypokalemia in burmese is a skeletal muscle weakness that is frequently episodic in nature either generalized or sometimes localized to the cervical and thoracic limb girdle muscles burmese hypokalemia is suspected to be a single locus autosomal recessive trait a genome wide case-control study using the illumina infinium feline 63k iselect dna array was performed using 35 cases and 25 controls from the burmese breed that identified a locus on chromosome e1 associated with hypokalemia within approximately 1.2 mb of the highest associated snp two candidate genes were identified kcnh4 and wnk4 direct sequencing of the genes revealed a nonsense mutation producing a premature stop codon within wnk4 c.2899c t leading to a truncated protein that lacks the c-terminal coiled-coil domain and the highly conserved akt1/sgk phosphorylation site all cases were homozygous for the mutation although the exact mechanism causing hypokalemia has not been determined extrapolation from the homologous human and mouse genes suggests the mechanism may involve a potassium-losing nephropathy a genetic test to screen for the genetic defect within the active breeding population has been developed which should lead to eradication of the mutation and improved general health within the breed moreover the identified mutation may help clarify the role of the protein in k+ regulation and the cat represents the first animal model for wnk4-associated hypokalemia pmid:23285264 high prevalence of hypokalemia after acute acetaminophen overdose impact of psychiatric

hypokalemia on electromechanical window excitation wavelength and repolarization gradients in guinea-pig and rabbit hearts pubmed central osadchii oleg e. 2014-01-01 normal hearts exhibit a positive time difference between the end of ventricular contraction and the end of qt interval which is referred to as the electromechanical em window drug-induced prolongation of repolarization may lead to the negative em window which was proposed to be a novel proarrhythmic marker this study examined whether abnormal changes in the em window may account for arrhythmogenic effects produced by hypokalemia left ventricular pressure electrocardiogram and epicardial monophasic action potentials were recorded in perfused hearts from guinea-pig and rabbit hypokalemia 2.5 mm k+ was found to prolong repolarization reduce the em window and promote tachyarrhythmia nevertheless during both regular pacing and extrasystolic excitation the increased qt interval invariably remained shorter than the duration of mechanical systole thus yielding positive em window values hypokalemia -induced arrhythmogenicity was associated with slowed ventricular conduction and shortened effective refractory periods which translated to a reduced excitation wavelength index hypokalemia also evoked non-uniform prolongation of action potential duration in distinct epicardial regions which resulted in increased spatial variability in the repolarization time these findings suggest that arrhythmogenic effects of hypokalemia are not accounted for by the negative em window and are rather attributed to abnormal changes in ventricular conduction times refractoriness excitation wavelength and spatial repolarization gradients pmid:25141124 autophagic degradation of aquaporin-2 is an early event in

occurs in patients with severe malnutrition when refeeding begins after a long period of starvation this syndrome increases the risk of clinical complications and mortality hypophosphatemia is considered the primary characteristic of the syndrome the aim of our study was to investigate the presence of other electrolyte alterations in patients with cancer during the early stage of refeeding methods in this observational study we enrolled 34 patients with cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract receiving upfront radiotherapy who were also enrolled in a nutrition program a caloric intake assessment anthropometric measurements and biochemical laboratory tests were performed results significant weight loss ∼20 was found in these patients in the patients receiving artificial nutrition we found lower levels of potassium and total protein compared with those who were fed orally p 0.03 for potassium and 0.02 for protein respectively patients on enteral tube feeding had a higher caloric

method with 10 rabbits in each group all the animals were injected with 3 kcl through the auricular marginal veins by a micro-injection pump and the target plasma potassium concentration was 4 mmol/l the rabbits in conventional potassium supplementation group were administered continuously potassium infusion at the standard infusion rate of 0.4 mmol×kg -1 ×h -1 and those in the individual-specific rapid potassium supplementation group were treated in two steps first a loading dose of potassium was rapidly injected within 5 minutes and this step was repeated until the plasma potassium

followed by transient hypokalemia in recovery we investigated whether the β 2 -agonist salbutamol attenuated the exercise-hyperkalemia and exacerbated the post-exercise hypokalemia and whether hypokalemia was associated with impaired cardiac repolarization qt hysteresis eleven healthy adults participated in a randomized counterbalanced double-blind trial receiving either 1000 µg salbutamol sal or placebo plac by inhalation arterial plasma potassium concentration k a was measured at rest during 3 min intense rowing exercise and 60 min recovery qt hysteresis was calculated from ecg n=8 k a increased above baseline during exercise rest 3.72 plus minus 0.7 vs end-exercise 6.81 plus minus 1.4 mm p 0.001 mean plus minus sd and decreased rapidly during early recovery to below baseline restoration was incomplete at 60 min post-exercise p 0.05 k a was less during sal than plac 4.39 plus minus 0.13 vs. 4.73 plus minus 0.19 mm pooled across all times p=0.001 treatment main effect k a was lower after sal than plac from 2 min pre-exercise until 2.5 min during exercise and at 50 and 60 min post-exercise p 0.05 the post-exercise decline in k a was correlated with qt hysteresis r=0.343 n=112 pooled data p=0.001 thus the decrease in k a from end-exercise by ~4 mm was associated with reduced qt hysteresis by ~75 ms. whilst salbutamol lowered k a during exercise no additive hypokalemic effects occurred in early recovery suggesting there may be a protective mechanism against severe or prolonged hypokalemia after exercise when treated by salbutamol this is important since

decarboxylase activity all of these parameters were rapidly restored when potassium supply was normalized immunocytochemical analysis of gonadotropes and plasma lh values suggested that the pulsatile liberation of lh by the pituitary was impaired in the potassium-deficient male mice because the synthesis of testosterone in the potassium-deficient mice was stimulated by exogenous lh hcg or gnrh one can conclude that alteration of the transcellular potassium gradient could affect the regulation of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-testicular axis by affecting the pulsatile release of gnrh our results showing that the stimulation of lh secretion after castration was similar in control and potassium-deficient male mice suggest that a testicular factor s different from testosterone could be

significant increase in colonic h -k -atpase mrna abundance was observed in response to chronic dietary k+ depletion but not to chronic metabolic acidosis the alpha 1-isoform of na -k -atpase which is also expressed in distal colon did not respond consistently to either chronic dietary k+ depletion or chronic metabolic acidosis the gastric probe did not hybridize to total rna from distal colon but as expected hybridized to total stomach rna however the abundance of gastric h -k -atpase or na -k -atpase in stomach was not altered consistently by either chronic dietary k+ depletion or metabolic

hiroshi 2011-01-01 we report herein a 27-year-old male case of inherited distal renal tubular acidosis complicated with renal diabetes insipidus the symptoms of which were aggravated by the occurrence of diabetes mellitus at 2 months after birth he was diagnosed as having inherited distal renal tubular acidosis and thereafter supplementation of both potassium and alkali was started to treat his hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis at the age of 4 years calcification of the bilateral renal medulla was detected by computed tomography subsequently his urinary volume gradually increased and polyuria of approximately 4 l/day persisted at the age of 27 years he became fond of sugar-sweetened drinks and also often forgot to take the medicine he was admitted to our hospital due to polyuria of more than 10 l day muscle weakness and gait disturbance laboratory tests disclosed worsening of both hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis in addition to severe hyperglycemia it seemed likely that occurrence of diabetes mellitus and cessation of medications can induce osmotic diuresis and aggravate hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis consequently severe dehydration hypokalemia -induced damage of his urinary concentration ability and enhancement of the renin angiotensin system occurred and thereby possibly worsened his hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis as normalization of hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis might have exacerbated hypokalemia further dehydration and hypokalemia were treated first following intensive treatment these abnormalities were improved but polyuria persisted elevated plasma antidiuretic hormone 12.0 pg/ml and deficit of renal responses to antidiuretic hormone suggested that the polyuria was attributable to the preexisting renal diabetes insipidus possibly caused by bilateral renal medulla calcification thiazide diuretic or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were not effective for the treatment of diabetes insipidus in the present case hypokalemic

setting case report herein we present the case of a 38-year-old woman with untreated hypertension and hyperthyroidism she presented with muscle weakness nausea vomiting and diarrhea since one week the initial diagnosis was tpp however biochemistry tests showed hypokalemia with metabolic alkalosis and renal potassium wasting moreover a suppressed plasma renin level and a high plasma aldosterone level were noted which was suggestive of primary aldosteronism abdominal computed tomography confirmed this diagnosis conclusions therefore it is imperative to consider other causes of hypokalemia

different causes however the most common is the hypokalemia associated with flaccid paralysis secondary to chronic renal failure in humans the most common causes of acute flaccid paralysis are hypokalemia precipitated by thyrotoxicosis and familial forms linked to mutations in sodium potassium and calcium channel genes here we describe the sequencing and analysis of skeletal muscle ion channels in felis catus that could be related to periodic paralyses in humans contributing to the understanding of the genetic susceptibility to feline neck ventroflexion and paralysis we studied genomic dna from eleven cats including five animals that were hyperthyroid with hypokalemia although only one presented with muscle weakness and six healthy control domestic cats we identified the ion channel ortholog genes kcnj2 kcnj12 kcnj14 cacna1s and scn4a in the felis catus genome together with several polymorphic variants upon comparative alignment with other genomes we found that felis catus provides evidence for a high genomic conservation of ion channel sequences although we hypothesized that neck ventroflexion in cats could be associated with a thyrotoxic or familial periodic paralysis channel mutation we did not identify any previously detected human channel mutation in the hyperthyroid cat presenting hypokalemia however based on the small number of affected cats in this study we can not yet rule out this molecular mechanism notwithstanding hyperthyroidism should still be considered as a differential diagnosis in hypokalemic feline paralysis pmid:25063199

cardiac delayed afterdepolarization-mediated triggered activity pubmed liu michael b ko christopher y song zhen garfinkel alan weiss james n qu zhilin 2016-12-06 ventricular myocytes are excitable cells whose voltage threshold for action potential ap excitation is ∼-60 mv at which i na is activated to give rise to a fast upstroke therefore for a short stimulus pulse to elicit an ap a stronger stimulus is needed if the resting potential lies further away from the i na threshold such as in hypokalemia however for an ap elicited by a long duration stimulus or a diastolic spontaneous calcium release we observed that the stimulus needed was lower in hypokalemia than in normokalemia in both computer simulations and experiments of rabbit ventricular myocytes this observation provides insight into why hypokalemia promotes calcium-mediated triggered activity despite the resting potential lying further away from the i na threshold to understand the underlying mechanisms we performed bifurcation analyses and demonstrated that there is a dynamical threshold resulting from a saddle-node bifurcation mainly determined by i k1 and i ncx this threshold is close to the voltage at which i k1 is maximum and lower than the i na threshold after exceeding this dynamical threshold the membrane voltage will automatically depolarize above the i na threshold due to the large negative slope of the i k1 -v curve this dynamical threshold becomes much lower in hypokalemia especially with respect to calcium as predicted by our theory because of the saddle-node bifurcation the system can automatically depolarize even in the absence of i na to voltages higher than the i ca l threshold allowing for triggered aps in single myocytes with complete i na block however because i na is important for ap propagation in tissue blocking i na can still suppress premature ventricular excitations in cardiac tissue caused by calcium-mediated triggered activity this suppression is more effective in normokalemia than in hypokalemia due to the difference in dynamical thresholds copyright â© 2016 biophysical society published by elsevier inc clinical signs of radiologic pneumonia in

paralysis pubmed central kim sung-jo kang sun-yang yi jin woong kim seung-min 2014-01-01 purpose familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis hokpp is an autosomal dominant channelopathy characterized by episodic attacks of muscle weakness and hypokalemia mutations in the calcium channel gene cacna1s or the sodium channel gene scn4a have been found to be responsible for hokpp however the mechanism that causes hypokalemia remains to be determined the aim of this study was to improve the understanding of this mechanism by investigating the expression of calcium-activated potassium kca channel genes in hokpp patients methods we measured the intracellular calcium concentration with fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester in skeletal muscle cells of hokpp patients and healthy individuals we examined the mrna and protein expression of kca channel genes kcnma1 kcnn1 kcnn2 kcnn3 and kcnn4 in both cell types results patient cells exhibited higher cytosolic calcium levels than normal cells quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the mrna levels of the kca channel genes did not significantly differ between patient and normal cells however western blot analysis showed that protein levels of the kcnma1 gene which encodes kca1.1 channels also called big potassium channels were significantly lower in the membrane fraction and higher in the cytosolic fraction of patient cells than normal cells when patient cells were exposed to 50 mm potassium buffer which was used to induce depolarization the altered subcellular distribution of bk channels remained unchanged conclusion these findings suggest a novel mechanism for the development of hypokalemia and paralysis in hokpp and demonstrate a connection between disease-associated mutations in

linked to neurohormonal activation which includes the adrenergic nervous system consequent elevations in circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine unmask an interdependency that exists between k+ mg2+ and ca2+ catecholamines for example regulate the large number of mg2+-dependent na/k atpase pumps present in skeletal muscle a hyperadrenergic state accounts for a sudden translocation of k+ into muscle and rapid appearance of hypokalemia in the myocardium catecholamines promote mg2+ efflux from cardiomyocytes whereas intracellular ca2+ influx and overloading account for the induction of oxidative stress and necrosis of these cells with leakage of their contents including troponins accordingly acute stressor states can be accompanied by nonischemic elevations in serum troponins together with the concordant appearance of hypokalemia hypomagnesemia and ionized hypocalcemia causing a delay in myocardial repolarization and electrocardiographic qtc prolongation raising the propensity for arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in this review we focus on the interdependency between k+ mg2+ and ca2+ which are clinically relevant

hearing impairment barttin is the β-subunit of the clc-k chloride channel which recruits it to the plasma membranes and the clc-k/barttin complex contributes to transepithelial chloride transport in the kidney and inner ear the retention of mutant forms of barttin in the endoplasmic reticulum er is etiologically linked to bartter syndrome type iv here we report that treatment with 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin 17-aag an hsp90 inhibitor enhanced the plasma membrane expression of mutant barttins r8l and g47r in madin-darby canine kidney cells administration of 17-aag to bsnd r8l/r8l knock-in mice elevated the plasma membrane expression of r8l in the kidney and inner ear thereby mitigating hypokalemia metabolic alkalosis and hearing loss these results suggest that

has not been addressed analytically we have therefore systematically reviewed and analyzed the available literature on this subject this was a systematic review of the literature the reports included in this review cover 172 subacute and 90 chronic cases of electrolyte imbalances in patients with cystic fibrosis the male female ratio was 1.57 electrolyte abnormalities were mostly associated with clinically inapparent fluid volume depletion mainly affected patients aged ≤2.5 years frequently tended to recur and often were found before the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis was established subacute presentation often included an history of heat exposure vomiting excessive sweating and pulmonary infection history of chronic presentation in contrast was often inconspicuous the tendency to hypochloremia hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis was similar between subacute and chronic patients with hyponatremia being more pronounced p 0.02 in subacute compared to chronic presentations subacute cases were treated parenterally chronic ones were usually managed with oral salt supplementation retention of urea and creatinine was documented in 38 of subacute cases the findings of our

hypercalciuria with nephrocalcinosis and renal failure nephrotic range proteinuria normal calciuria and hypokalemia have been rarely reported it is unknown whether the changes in phenotype observed over time are explained by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate gfr or whether there is any phenotype-genotype relationship to answer this we retrospectively analyzed data from 109 male patients with clcn5 mutations dent-1 and 9 patients with mutation of the ocrl gene dent-2 in dent-1 disease the estimated gfr decreased with age by 1.0 to 1.6 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 /yr in the absence and presence of nephrocalcinosis respectively with no significant difference median values of low-molecular-weight proteinuria were in the nephrotic range and remained at the same level even in late renal

result that general practioners more and more often use drugs which may influence potassium metabolism at the kidney or gastrointestinal level or the transmembrane transport of potassium at the cellular level potassium abnormalities may result in life-theatening clinical conditions hypokalemia is most frequently caused by renal loss of this electrolyte thiazide thiazide-like and loop diuretics glucocorticoids and the gastrointestinal tract laxatives diarrhea vomiting external fistula and may be the result of an increased intracellular potassium influx induced by sympathicomimetics used mostly by patients with asthma or by insulin overdosage in diabetic subjects the leading symptoms of hypokalemia are skeletal and smooth muscle weakness and cardiac arrhythmias hyperkalemia may be caused by acute or end-stage renal failure impaired tubular excretion of potassium blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cyclosporine antifungal drugs potassium sparing diuretics acidemia and severe cellular injury tumor lysis syndrome hyperkalemia may be the cause of severe injury of both skeletal and smooth muscle cells the specific

2012-08-14 the na-cl cotransporter ncc which is the target of inhibition by thiazides is located in close proximity to the chloride-absorbing transporter pendrin in the kidney distal nephron single deletion of pendrin or ncc does not cause salt wasting or excessive diuresis under basal conditions raising the possibility that these transporters are predominantly active during salt depletion or in response to excess aldosterone we hypothesized that pendrin and ncc compensate for loss of function of the other under basal conditions thereby masking the role that each plays in salt absorption to test our hypothesis we generated pendrin/ncc double knockout ko mice by crossing pendrin ko mice with ncc ko mice pendrin/ncc double ko mice displayed severe salt wasting and sharp increase in urine output under basal conditions as a result animals developed profound volume depletion renal failure and metabolic alkalosis without hypokalemia which were all corrected with salt replacement we

taquicardia goiter tremor and ophthalmopathy most often attacks arose during the night and recovered spontaneously but some patients evolved to total quadriplegia and few experienced cardiac arrhythmias all patients had suppressed tsh and elevated t4 and most had positive anti-thyroid antibodies indicating autoimmunity thyrotoxic etiology potassium was low in all patients during the crisis prophylactic potassium therapy has not been shown to prevent attacks however it was useful for curbing the paralysis during the crisis we identified the mutation r83h in the kcne3 gene in one sporadic case and m58v in the kcne4 gene in one case with family history furthermore we identified other genetic polymorphisms in the cacna1s scn4a kcne1 kcne2 kcne1l kcnj2 kcnj8 e kcnj11 genes we

stung by scorpion over a period of 6 months in the state of morelos mexico the patients were said to be asymptomatic when they presented just local symptoms and were said to be symptomatic when showing local symptoms and at least one systemic symptom the clinical status was evaluated at the admission at the emergency room of the hospital and 30 min after the administration of polyspecific f ab 2 anti-scorpion therapy to symptomatic children forty-one percent of the children were asymptomatic and 59 symptomatic potassium and sodium imbalance and an elongation of the qt interval were detected the rate of hypokalemia was higher in symptomatic than on asymptomatic children 50 and 6 respectively hypokalemia persisted in 19 in symptomatic patients whereas sodium reached normal levels 30 min after anti-venom therapy the hypokalemia statistically correlated with elongation of the qt interval the concentration of the toxic components of c.l.l in serum was significantly higher in symptomatic than asymptomatic children and the serum levels of the toxic component significantly decreased to undetectable levels after the application of anti-venom therapy despite the small size of the sample this study establishes that severity of envenoming was statistically related to potassium imbalance in serum qt interval and the concentration of toxic components in serum which decreased

cardiovascular events optimally with increasing doses of thiazides and thiazide analogs do not come further powerful effect of reducing blood pressure or cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but clearly elevate the side effects because of it the minimum effective dose level and the fixed-dose combination therapy should be preferred the use these drugs leads to especially positive outcome in elder patients isolated systolic hypertension heart failure after stroke and in black population loop diuretics as antihypertensive therapy can be used only by renal impairment the use of aldosterone antagonists can have a good effect not only on heart failure but also on prevention of atrial fibrillation furthermore using it in a combination therapy with thiazides it reduces the risk of

of the same coin pubmed central obeid o a hachem d h ayoub j j 2014-01-01 refeeding syndrome describes the metabolic and clinical changes attributed to aggressive rehabilitation of malnourished subjects the metabolic changes of refeeding are related to hypophosphatemia hypokalemia hypomagnesemia sodium retention and hyperglycemia and these are believed to be mainly the result of increased insulin secretion following high carbohydrate intake in the past few decades increased consumption of processed food refined cereals oils sugar and sweeteners and so on lowered the intake of several macrominerals mainly phosphorus potassium and magnesium this seems to have compromised the postprandial status of these macrominerals in a manner that mimics low grade refeeding syndrome status at the pathophysiological level this condition favored the development of the different components of the metabolic syndrome thus it is reasonable to postulate that metabolic syndrome is the result of long

of thiazide-like diuretics versus thiazide-type diuretics a meta-analysis pubmed liang wenjing ma hui cao luxi yan wenjiang yang jingjing 2017-11-01 thiazide diuretics are widely used for the management of hypertension in recent years it has been actively debated that there is interchangeability of thiazide-type diuretics hydrochlorothiazide and thiazide-like diuretics including indapamide and chlorthalidone for the treatment of hypertension with the purpose of seeking out the best thiazide diuretic for clinicians we summarized the existing evidence on the two types of drugs and conducted a meta-analysis on their efficacy in lowering blood pressure and effects on blood electrolyte glucose and total cholesterol twelve trials were identified five based on the comparison of indapamide versus hydrochlorothiazide and seven based on the chlorthalidone versus hydrochlorothiazide in the meta-analysis of blood pressure reduction thiazide-like diuretics seemed to further reduce systolic bp 95 ci -5.59 -5.69 -5.49 p 0.001 and diastolic bp 95 ci -1.98 -3.29 -0.66 p 0.003 meanwhile in the analysis of side effects the incidence of hypokalemia 95 ci 1.58 0.80 3.12 p 0.19 hyponatremia 95 ci -0.14 -0.57 0.30 p 0.54 change of blood glucose 95 ci 0.13 -0.16 0.41 p 0.39 and total cholesterol 95 ci 0.13 -0.16 0.41 p 0.39 showed that there is no statistical significant differences between the two groups of drugs in conclusion using thiazide-like diuretics is superior to thiazide-type diuretics in reducing blood pressure without increasing the incidence of

yanase toshihiko kobayashi kunihisa 2018-04-27 objectives we retrospectively investigated the clinical and endocrinological characteristics of adrenal incidentalomas methods we studied 61 patients who had been diagnosed with adrenal incidentalomas and had undergone detailed clinical and endocrinological evaluations while hospitalized we used common criteria to diagnose the functional tumors but for sub-clinical cushing 's syndrome we used an updated set of diagnosis criteria serum cortisol ≥1.8 μg/dl after a positive response to a 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test if the patient has a low morning acth level 10 pg/ml and a loss of the diurnal serum cortisol rhythm results of the 61 patients none 0 had malignant tumors 8 13.1 had pheochromocytoma and 15 24.6 had primary aldosteronism when diagnosed by our revised criteria 13 21.3 had cortisol-secreting adenomas cushing 's syndrome and sub-clinical cushing 's syndrome and 25 41.0 had non-functional tumors compared with the non-functional tumor group the primary aldosteronism group and the cortisol-secreting adenoma group were significantly younger and had significantly lower rates of hypokalemia whereas the pheochromocytoma group had significantly larger tumors and a significantly lower body mass index conclusion our study found a larger percentage of functional tumors among adrenal incidentalomas than past reports partly because we used a lower serum cortisol level after a dexamethasone suppression test to diagnose sub-clinical cushing 's syndrome and because all of the patients were hospitalized and could therefore receive more detailed examinations young patients with hypokalemia or lean patients with large adrenal tumors warrant particularly careful investigation a rare case of an acth/crh

co-secreting midgut net both high-dose dexamethasone testing and bipss suggested cushing 's disease however the clinical presentation with a rather rapid onset of cushingoid features hyperpigmentation and hypokalemia led to the consideration of ectopic acth/crh-secretion and prompted a further workup computed tomography ct of the abdomen revealed a cecal mass which was identified as a predominantly crh-secreting neuroendocrine tumor to the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of an acth/crh co-secreting tumor of the cecum presenting with biochemical features suggestive of cushing 's disease the discrimination between a cushing 's disease and ectopic cushing 's syndrome is challenging and has many caveats.ectopic acth/crh co-secreting tumors are very rare.dynamic tests as well as bipss may be compatible with cushing 's disease in ectopic crh-secretion.high levels of crh may induce hyperplasia of the corticotroph cells in the pituitary this could be the cause of a preserved pituitary response to dexamethasone and crh.clinical features of acth-dependent hypercortisolism with rapid development of cushing 's syndrome hyperpigmentation high circulating levels of

syndrome such as hypophosphatemia hypokalemia hypocalcemia and hypoalbuminemia of the total 35 celiac disease patients 5 median age 6.5 range 2.2-10 years 3 boys were identified as having refeeding syndrome all 5 children were severely malnourished body mass index 14 kg/m and all of them had anemia hypophosphatemia hypokalemia hypoalbuminemia and hypocalcemia meaning that they had the perfect setting for developing refeeding syndrome at the same time their clinical features fulfilled the criteria for celiac crisis except that their symptoms have worsened after the introduction of a gluten-free diet nevertheless instead of using steroids they were managed as refeeding syndrome in terms of correction of electrolytes and gradual feeding and that led to a successful outcome in all

acidosis although the glomerular filtration rate gfr is usually preserved and hypertension and overt proteinuria are absent it has to be considered that patients with drta also suffer from chronic kidney disease ckd with an increased risk for adverse pregnancy-related outcomes typical complications of drta include severe hypokalemia leading to cardiac arrhythmias and paralysis nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis several physiologic changes occur in normal pregnancy including alterations in acid-base and electrolyte homeostasis as well as in gfr however data on pregnancy in women with inherited drta are scarce we report the course of pregnancy in three women with hereditary drta complications observed were severe metabolic acidosis profound hypokalemia aggravated by hyperemesis gravidarum recurrent urinary tract infection uti and ureteric obstruction leading to renal failure however the outcome of all five pregnancies 1 pregnancy each for mothers n. 1 and 2 3 pregnancies for mother n. 3 was excellent due to timely interventions our findings highlight the importance of close nephrologic monitoring of women with inherited drta during pregnancy in addition to routine assessment of creatinine and proteinuria caregivers should especially focus on acid-base status plasma potassium and urinary tract infections patients should be screened for renal obstruction in the case of typical symptoms uti or renal failure furthermore genetic identification of the underlying mutation may a support early nephrologic referral during pregnancy and a better management of the

hypoaldosteronism it is caused by deficiency of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase which results in a defect of the peripheral metabolism of cortisol to cortisone as a consequence the serum cortisol half-life t½ is prolonged acth is suppressed and serum cortisol concentration is normal the hormonal diagnosis of the disorder is made by the increased ratio of urine-free cortisol to cortisone in patients with ame this ratio is 5-18 while in normal individuals it is 0.5 these studies suggest that an abnormality in cortisol action or metabolism results in cortisol behaving as a potent mineralocorticoid and causing the syndrome of ame we report three siblings two female and one male with the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess who presented with hypertension hypokalemia low renin and low aldosterone levels the finding of abnormally high ratios of 24-h urine-free cortisol to cortisone in our three patients case 1 8.4 case 2 25 and case 3 7.5 confirmed the diagnosis of apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome in these children they were treated with oral potassium supplements the addition of spironolactone resulted in a decrease in blood pressure rise in serum

k+ in human ventricle an illustrated review pubmed trenor beatriz cardona karen romero lucia gomez juan f saiz javier rajamani sridharan belardinelli luiz giles wayne 2018-05-01 potassium levels in the plasma k o are regulated precisely under physiological conditions however increases from approx 4.5 to 8.0mm can occur as a consequence of e.g. endurance exercise ischemic insult or kidney failure this hyperkalemic modulation of ventricular electrophysiology has been studied extensively hypokalemia is also common it can occur in response to diuretic therapy following renal dialysis or during recovery from endurance exercise in the human ventricle clinical hypokalemia e.g. k o levels of approx 3.0mm can cause marked changes in both the resting potential and the action potential waveform and these may promote arrhythmias here we provide essential background information concerning the main k -sensitive ion channel mechanisms that act in concert to produce prominent short-term ventricular electrophysiological changes and illustrate these by implementing recent mathematical models of the human ventricular action potential even small changes ~1mm in k o result in significant alterations in two different k currents i k1 and herg these changes can markedly alter in resting membrane potential and/or action potential waveform in human ventricle specifically a reduction in net outward transmembrane k currents repolarization reserve and an increased substrate input resistance contribute to electrophysiological instability during the plateau of the action potential and may promote pro-arrhythmic early after-depolarizations eads translational settings where these insights apply include optimal diuretic therapy and the interpretation of data from phase ii and iii trials

potassium homeostasis can cause either hyperkalemia or hypokalemia and result in serious consequences although the consequences of acute and chronic hyperkalemia and treatment of these conditions in ckd have been widely appreciated by nephrologists more recent information has focused attention on the consequences of chronic hypokalemia several recent studies have documented a u-shaped relationship between the serum k and higher mortality in several clinical studies the causes of dyskalemias are placed into the unique perspective of patients with ckd and its evolution with progression of ckd to later stages and focuses on the pathophysiology of these disorders emphasis is placed on the high mortality associated with both low and high levels of potassium that are unique to patients with ckd recent information regarding sensors of changes in the serum k that evoke changes in nacl transport in the dct1 and subsequent efferent responses by aldosterone-responsive cells in the dct2 and cortical collecting duct to adjust k secretion by the renal outer medullary potassium channel is reviewed in detail these sensing mechanisms can be interrupted by drugs such as the calcineurin inhibitors to cause both hypertension and hyperkalemia in kidney transplant patients or can be inherited as familial hypertensive hyperkalemia the role and pathogenesis of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in causing hyperkalemia is a common stop point for cessation of these important drugs but and newer agents to lower the serum k that might allow continuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy are examined finally the importance of emphasis on potassium-containing foods such as fresh produce and fruit in the diets of patients with early-stage ckd is examined as an under-appreciated area requiring more emphasis by nephrologists caring for these patients and may be unique a clinical

differentiating between cushing s disease and ectopic cushing s syndrome may be particularly difficult if predominant ectopic crh secretion leads to pituitary corticotroph hyperplasia that may mimic cushing s disease during dynamic testing with both dexamethasone and crh as well as bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling bipss we present the case of a 24-year-old man diagnosed with acth-dependent cushing s syndrome caused by an acth/crh co-secreting midgut net both high-dose dexamethasone testing and bipss suggested cushing s disease however the clinical presentation with a rather rapid onset of cushingoid features hyperpigmentation and hypokalemia led to the consideration of ectopic acth/crh-secretion and prompted a further workup computed tomography ct of the abdomen revealed a cecal mass which was identified as a predominantly crh-secreting neuroendocrine tumor to the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of an acth/crh co-secreting tumor of the cecum presenting with biochemical features suggestive of cushing s disease learning points the discrimination between a cushing s disease and ectopic cushing s syndrome is challenging and has many caveats ectopic acth/crh co-secreting tumors are very rare dynamic tests as well as bipss may be compatible with cushing s disease in ectopic crh-secretion high levels of crh may induce hyperplasia of the corticotroph cells in the pituitary this could be the cause of a preserved pituitary response to dexamethasone and crh clinical features of acth-dependent hypercortisolism with rapid development of cushing s syndrome hyperpigmentation high circulating levels of cortisol with associated hypokalemia peripheral edema and proximal myopathy should be a warning flag of ectopic cushing s syndrome

mechanism of polyuria in potassium depletion pubmed central berl tomas linas stuart l. aisenbrey gary a. anderson robert j 1977-01-01 the association of potassium k depletion with polyuria and a concentrating defect is established but the extent to which these defects could be secondary to an effect of low k on water intake has not been systematically investigated to determine whether hypokalemia has a primary effect to increase thirst and whether any resultant polyuria and polydipsia contribute to the concentrating defect we studied three groups of rats kept in metabolic cages for 15 days the groups were set up as follows group 1 normal diets and ad lib fluids n 12 group 2 k-deficient diet on ad lib fluids n 12 and group 3 k-deficient diet and fluid intake matched to group 1 n 14 daily urine flow and urinary osmolality of groups 1 and 3 were not significantly different throughout the study in contrast as of day 6 group 2 rats consistently had a higher fluid intake p 0.0025 higher urine flow p 0.001 and lower urinary osmolality p 0.001 than the other two groups these alterations in fluid intake and urine flow preceded a defect in maximal concentrating ability on day 7 maximal urinary osmolality was 2,599±138 msmol/kg in rats on k-deficient intake and 2,567±142 msmol/kg in controls to determine whether this primary polydipsia is itself responsible for the development of the concentrating defect the three groups of rats were dehydrated on day 15 despite different levels of fluid intake maximal urinary osmolality was impaired equally in groups 2 and 3 1,703 and 1,511 msmol/kg respectively as compared to rats in group 1 2,414 msmol/kg p 0.001 we therefore conclude that k depletion stimulates thirst and the resultant increase in water intake is largely responsible for the observed polyuria after 15 days of a k-deficient diet the impaired maximal urinary concentration in hypokalemia however was not related to increased water intake since fluid restriction did not abolish the renal concentrating defect pmid:893666 periodic paralysis and encephalopathy as initial manifestations of graves disease case report and review of the literature

sequencing wes was performed on the child and parents which identified causal variation of the proband 's early-onset disease the proband 's hypertension was resistant to treatment requiring a multiple drug regimen including amiloride spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide we suspected a monogenic form of hypertension because of the persistent hypokalemia with low plasma levels of renin and aldosterone to address this we focused on rare functional variants and indels and performed gene-based tests incorporating linkage scores and allele frequency and filtered on deleterious functional

bartter syndrome severe rare orphan kidney disease a step towards therapy through pharmacogenetic and epidemiological studies pubmed conte elena imbrici paola sahbani dalila liantonio antonella conte diana 2018-05-01 bartter syndromes bs types 1-5 are rare salt-losing tubulopathies presenting with overlapping clinical phenotypes including marked salt wasting and hypokalemia leading to polyuria polydipsia volume contraction muscle weakness and growth retardation these diseases are due to an impairment of sodium potassium chloride reabsorption caused by mutations in genes encoding for ion channel or transporters expressed in specific nephron tubule segments particularly bs type 3 is a clinically heterogeneous form caused by mutations in clcnkb gene which encodes the clc-kb chloride channel involved in nacl reabsorption in the renal tubule specific therapy for bs is lacking and the only pharmacotherapy up today available is purely symptomatic and characterized by limiting side effects the improvement of our understanding of the phenotype/genotype correlation and of the precise pathogenic mechanisms associated with bs type 3 as well as the pharmacological characterization of clc-k chloride channels are fundamental to design therapies tailored upon patients mutation this mini review focused on recent studies representing relevant forward steps in the field as well as

clinical acid-base problem solving pubmed whittier william l rutecki gregory w 2004-03-01 acid-base problem solving has been an integral part of medical practice in recent generations diseases discovered in the last 30-plus years for example bartter syndrome and gitelman syndrome d-lactic acidosis and bulimia nervosa can be diagnosed according to characteristic acid-base findings accuracy in acid-base problem solving is a direct result of a reproducible systematic approach to arterial ph partial pressure of carbon dioxide bicarbonate concentration and electrolytes the 'rules of five is one tool that enables clinicians to determine the cause of simple and complex disorders even triple acid-base disturbances with consistency in addition other electrolyte abnormalities that accompany acid-base disorders such as hypokalemia can be incorporated into algorithms that complement the rules and contribute to efficient problem solving in a wide variety of diseases recently urine electrolytes have also assisted clinicians in further characterizing select disturbances acid-base patterns in many ways can serve as a 'common diagnostic pathway shared by all subspecialties in medicine from infectious disease eg lactic acidemia with highly active antiviral therapy therapy through endocrinology eg conn 's syndrome high urine chloride alkalemia to the interface between primary care and psychiatry eg bulimia nervosa with multiple potential acid-base disturbances acid-base problem solving is the key to unlocking otherwise unrelated diagnoses inasmuch as the rules are clinical tools they are applied throughout this monograph to diverse pathologic conditions typical in contemporary practice electrical storm in patients with an implanted defibrillator a matter of definition pubmed israel carsten w barold s serge 2007-10-01 the term electrical storm es indicates a state of cardiac electrical instability manifested by several episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmias vts within a short time in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd es is best defined as 3 appropriate vt detections in 24 h treated by antitachycardia pacing shock or eventually untreated but sustained in a vt monitoring zone the number of shocks and inappropriate detections are irrelevant for the definition es occurs in approximately 25 of icd patients within 3 years with typically 5-55 individual vts within one storm potential triggers can be found in approximately 66 of patients and include new/worsened heart failure changes in antiarrhythmic medication context with other illness psychological stress diarrhea and hypokalemia in most patients es consists of monomorphic vt indicating the presence of reentry while ventricular fibrillation indicating acute ischemia is rare es seems to have a low immediate mortality 1 but frequently 50-80 leads to hospitalization long-term prognostic implications of es are unclear the key intervention in es is reduction of the elevated sympathetic tone by beta blockers and frequently benzodiazepines amiodarone i.v has also been successful and azimilide seems promising while class i antiarrhythmic drugs are usually unsuccessful substrate mapping and vt ablation may be useful in treatment and prevention of es prevention of es requires icd programming systematically avoiding unnecessary shocks

normal reduced or increased in cirrhosis the mechanism of departures from normal is not known other renal functional changes in cirrhosis include avid sodium reabsorption impaired concentrating and diluting abilities and partial renal tubular acidosis fluid and electrolyte disorders are common sodium retention with edema and ascites should generally be treated conservatively because they tend to disappear as the liver heals and because forced diuresis has hazards the indications for diuretics are 1 incipient or overt atelectasis 2 abdominal distress and 3 possibility of skin breakdown hyponatremia is common and its mechanism and treatment must be assessed in each patient hypokalemia occurs and requires treatment respiratory alkalosis and renal tubular acidosis seldom need therapy the hepatorenal syndrome is defined as functional renal failure in the absence of other known causes of renal functional impairment the prognosis is terrible and therapy is unsatisfactory the best approach is not to equate the occurrence of renal failure in cirrhosis with the hepatorenal syndrome rather the physician should first explore all treatable causes of renal failure eg dehydration

locations in the kidney rapid regulation of ut-a1 results from the combination of phosphorylation and membrane accumulation phosphorylation of ut-a1 has been linked to vasopressin and hyperosmolality although through different kinases other acute influences on urea transporter activity are ubiquitination and glycosylation both of which influence the membrane association of the urea transporter again through different mechanisms long-term regulation of urea transport is most closely associated with the environment that the kidney experiences low-protein diets may influence the amount of urea

pmid:27314329 nephrogenic diabetes insipidus pubmed velásquez-jones luis medeiros-domingo mara the anti-diuretic hormone arginine-vasopressin avp is released from the pituitary and regulates water reabsorption in the principal cells of the kidney collecting duct binding of avp to the arginine-vasopressin receptor type-2 in the basolateral membrane leads to translocation of aquaporin-2 water channels to the apical membrane of the principal cells of the collecting duct inducing water permeability of the membrane this results in water reabsorption in the collecting duct of the nephron

telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide treatment pubmed cakir mehtap 2010-12-01 the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas has crucial importance in maintaining blood pressure thus blockade of raas is an effective antihypertensive treatment choice the final step in raas stimulation is aldosterone secretion by angiotensin ii which leads to increased renal tubular sodium absorption and potassium secretion angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs allow blockade of raas by blocking binding of angiotensin ii to the at 1 receptors there are several fixed-dose combinations of arbs with hydrochlorothiazide in the market providing antihypertensive therapies with complimentary mechanisms of action with such combinations while arb inhibits the vasoconstricting action and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin ii hydrochlorothiazide affects the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption and directly increases excretion of sodium and chloride in the distal tubule and promotes water excretion also hypokalemia which may be triggered by increased urinary potassium loss induced by hydrochlorothiazide is opposed by arb use and hence arb/hydrochlorothiazide combination is known to be safe in terms of potassium imbalance in this case report significant hyperkalemia and hyponatremia related to telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide use in a diabetic patient has been presented clinical analysis of hyperkalemia after esophagectomy pubmed central chen qiang zhang wei-guo chen shu-chang 2017-01-01 abstract rationale the occurrence of hyperkalemia after esophagectomy is clinically rare patients who underwent esophagectomy often have a serum potassium level due to perioperative reduced intake fluids loss consumption and other reasons these patients often require the artificial administration of potassium rapid fluid loss and physiological consumption lead to the deficiency of potassium even hypokalemia patients often require the addition of a large amount of potassium after operation the occurrence of hyperkalemia after esophagectomy is never been reported patient concerns the patient presented with continuous tachycardia palpitations chest tightness progressive nausea irritability progressive myasthenia gravis diagnoses hyperkalemia sepsis acidosis diabetes postoperative esophageal cancer interventions prompt anti-infection treatment and the management of blood sugar hemodialysis was performed to correct sthe acidosis and electrolyte disorder outcomes all symptoms were alleviated lessons therefore there is a need to regularly test electrolytes especially in patients with diabetes as well as better blood glucose control attention should be paid to the potential of infection and to avoiding

diabetic ketoacidosis dka or nonketotic hyperglycemia nkh occurring in patients with preserved renal function is the absence of osmotic diuresis in dh which eliminates the need for large fluid and solute including potassium replacement we analyzed published reports of serum potassium k abnormalities and their treatment in dh hyperkalemia was often present at presentation of dh with higher frequency and severity than in hyperglycemic syndromes in patients with preserved renal function the frequency and severity of hyperkalemia were higher in dh episodes with dka than those with nkh in both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis for dka the frequency and severity of hyperkalemia were similar in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis for nkh hyperkalemia was more severe and frequent in hemodialysis than in peritoneal dialysis insulin infusion corrected the hyperkalemia of dh in most cases additional measures for the management of hyperkalemia or modest potassium infusions for hypokalemia were needed in a few dh episodes the predictors of the decrease in serum k during treatment of dh with insulin included the starting serum k level the decreases in serum values of glucose

are often complex and represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the physician usually these disorders do not develop in compensated cirrhotic patients but with the onset of the classic complications of cirrhosis such as ascites renal failure spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and variceal bleeding multiple electrolyte and acid-base disturbances emerge hyponatremia parallels ascites formation and is a well-known trigger of hepatic encephalopathy its management in this particular population poses a risky challenge due to the high susceptibility of cirrhotic patients to osmotic demyelination hypokalemia is common in the setting of cirrhosis multiple potassium wasting mechanisms both inherent to the disease and resulting from its management make these patients particularly susceptible to potassium depletion even in the setting of normokalemia acid-base disturbances range from classical respiratory alkalosis to high anion gap metabolic acidosis almost comprising the full

here we demonstrate that kcnj10 is a main contributor to the basolateral k conductance in the early distal convoluted tubule dct1 and determines the expression of the apical na-cl cotransporter ncc in the dct immunostaining demonstrated kcnj10 and kcnj16 were expressed in the basolateral membrane of dct and patch-clamp studies detected a 40-ps k channel in the basolateral membrane of the dct1 of p8/p10 wild-type kcnj10 +/+ mice wt this 40-ps k channel is absent in homozygous kcnj10 -/- knockout mice the disruption of kcnj10 almost completely eliminated the basolateral k conductance and decreased the negativity of the cell membrane potential in dct1 moreover the lack of kcnj10 decreased the basolateral cl conductance inhibited the expression of ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase and diminished the apical ncc expression in dct we conclude that kcnj10 plays a dominant role in determining the basolateral k conductance and membrane potential of dct1 and that the

activity is fundamental for defining blood pressure levels decreased ncc activity is associated with salt-remediable arterial hypotension with hypokalemia gitelman disease while increased activity results in salt-sensitive arterial hypertension with hyperkalemia pseudohypoaldosteronism type ii phaii the discovery of four different genes causing phaii revealed a complex multiprotein system that regulates the activity of ncc two genes encode for with-no-lysine k kinases wnk1 and wnk4 while two encode for kelch-like 3 klhl3 and cullin 3 cul3 proteins that form a ring type e3 ubiquitin ligase complex extensive research has shown that wnk1 and wnk4 are the targets for the klhl3-cul3 complex and that wnks modulate the activity of ncc by means of intermediary ste20-type kinases known as spak or osr1 the understanding of the effect of wnks on ncc is a complex issue but recent evidence discussed in this review suggests that we could be reaching the end of the dark ages regarding this matter

candidate region in 1q31-32 suggests genetic heterogeneity scitech connect sillen a. wadelius c. gustabson k.h 1994-09-01 familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis hokpp is an autosomal dominant disease with attacks of paralysis of varying severity the attacks occur at intervals of days to years in otherwise healthy people combined with hypokalemia during attacks the paralysis attacks are precipitated by a number of different factors like carbohydrate-rich meals cold exercise and mental stress recently linkage for hokpp was shown for chromosome 1q31-32 and the disease was mapped between d1s413 and d1s249 the gene for the calcium channel alfa1-subunit cacnl 1a3 maps to this interval and in two families no recombination was found between a polymorphism in the cacnl 1a3more » gene and the disease this gene is therefore considered to be a candidate for hokpp the analysis of a large danish family excludes linkage to this region and to the cacnl 1a3 gene in each direction from d1s413 18.8 cm could be excluded and for d1s249 14.9 cm the present study clearly excludes the possibility that the gene causing hokpp in a large danish family is located in the region 1q31-32 this result shows that hokpp is a heterogenous disease with only one mapped gene so far. « less novel molecular variants of the na-cl cotransporter gene are responsible for gitelman syndrome scitech

« less risperidone prolongs cardiac repolarization by blocking the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current pubmed drolet benoit yang tao daleau pascal roden dan m turgeon jacques 2003-06-01 cases of qt prolongation and sudden death have been reported with risperidone a neuroleptic agent increasingly prescribed worldwide although hypokalemia was present in some of these events we hypothesized that risperidone may have unsuspected electrophysiologic effects predisposing patients to proarrhythmia in six isolated guinea pig hearts risperidone elicited prolongation of cardiac

useful but there is no definite evidence that sodium bicarbonate administration to patients with acute metabolic acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis lactic acidosis septic shock intraoperative metabolic acidosis or cardiac arrest is beneficial regarding clinical outcomes or mortality rate patients with advanced chronic kidney disease usually show metabolic acidosis due to increased unmeasured anions and hyperchloremia it has been suggested that metabolic acidosis might have a negative impact on progression of kidney dysfunction and that sodium bicarbonate administration might attenuate this effect but further evaluation is required to validate such a renoprotective strategy sodium bicarbonate is the predominant buffer used in dialysis fluids and patients on maintenance dialysis are subjected to a load of sodium bicarbonate during the sessions suffering a transient metabolic alkalosis of variable severity side effects associated with sodium bicarbonate therapy

a type of hypertension with an underlying potentially correctable cause a secondary etiology may be suggested by symptoms e.g. flushing and sweating suggestive of pheochromocytoma examina- tion findings e.g. a renal bruit suggestive of renal artery stenosis or laboratory abnormalities e.g. hypokalemia suggestive of aldosteronism secondary hypertension also should be considered in patients with resistant hyper- tension and early or late onset of hypertension the prevalence of secondary hypertension and the most common etiologies vary by age group approximately 5 to 10 percent of adults with hypertension have a secondary cause in young adults particu- larly women renal artery stenosis caused by fibromuscular dyspla- sia is one of the most common secondary etiologies fibromuscular dysplasia can be detected by abdominal magnetic resonance imag- ing or computed tomography these same imaging modalities can be used to detect atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis a major cause of secondary hypertension in older adults in middle-aged adults aldosteronism is the most common secondary cause of hyperten- sion and the recommended initial diagnostic test is an aldosterone/ renin ratio up to 85 percent of children with hypertension have an identifiable cause most often renal parenchymal disease therefore all children with confirmed hypertension should have an evaluation for an underlying etiology that includes renal ultrasonography adrenal mass causing secondary hypertension pubmed robinson darlene y 2015-11-01 most hypertensive patients have essential primary hypertension only 5 to 10 have a secondary cause two clinical characteristics suggestive of secondary hypertension are early onset 30 years of age and severe hypertension 180/110 mm hg when faced with these findings clinicians should consider a secondary cause of hypertension a 22-year-old woman being evaluated for asthma exacerbation in the emergency department was noted to have severe persistent hypertension additional evaluation revealed severe hypokalemia metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia the patient was admitted to the hospital for blood pressure management electrolyte replacement and further evaluation of presumed hyperaldosteronism diagnostic imaging revealed a large adrenal mass surgical resection was performed leading to a diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism caused by adrenal carcinoma why should an emergency physician be aware of this secondary hypertension is far less common than essential hypertension however considering the large volume of patients seen in emergency

2012-01-01 eating disorders are usually associated with an increased risk of premature death with a wide range of rates and causes of mortality sudden death has been defined as the abrupt and unexpected occurrence of fatality for which no satisfactory explanation of the cause can be ascertained in many cases of sudden death autopsies do not clarify the main cause cardiovascular complications are usually involved in these deaths the purpose of this review was to report an update of the existing literature data on the main findings with respect to sudden death in eating disorders by means of a search conducted in pubmed the most relevant conclusion of this review seems to be that the main causes of sudden death in eating disorders are those related to cardiovascular complications the predictive value of the increased qt interval dispersion as a marker of sudden acute ventricular arrhythmia and death has been demonstrated eating disorder patients with severe cardiovascular symptoms should be hospitalized in general with respect to sudden death in eating disorders some findings eg long-term eating disorders chronic hypokalemia chronically low plasma albumin and qt intervals 600 milliseconds must be taken into account and it must be highlighted that during refeeding the adverse effects of hypophosphatemia include cardiac failure monitoring vital

of electrolyte disturbance in cancer development pubmed nriagu jerome darroudi firouz shomar basem 2016-10-01 this review contends that healthy water in terms of electrolyte balance is as important as pure water in promoting public health it considers the growing use of desalination demineralization technologies in drinking water treatment which often results in tap water with very low concentrations of sodium potassium magnesium and calcium ingestion of such water can lead to electrolyte abnormalities marked by hyponatremia hypokalemia hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which are among the most common and recognizable features in cancer patients the causal relationships between exposure to demineralized water and malignancies are poorly understood this review highlights some of the epidemiological and in vivo evidence that link dysregulated electrolyte metabolism with carcinogenesis and the development of cancer hallmarks it discusses how ingestion of demineralized water can have a procarcinogenic effect through mediating some of the critical pathways and processes in the cancer microenvironment such as angiogenesis genomic instability resistance to programmed cell death sustained proliferative signaling cell immortalization and tumorigenic inflammation evidence that hypoosmotic stress-response processes can upregulate a number of potential oncogenes is well supported by a number studies in view of the rising production and consumption of demineralized water in most parts of the world there is a strong need for further research on the biological importance and protean roles of electrolyte abnormalities in promoting antagonizing or otherwise enabling the development of cancer the countries of the gulf cooperative council gcc where most people

pubmed central gong yongfeng wang jinzhi yang jing gonzales ernie perez ronaldo hou jianghui 2015-01-01 a rare mendelian syndrome—pseudohypoaldosteronism type ii pha-ii —features hypertension hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis genetic linkage studies and exome sequencing have identified four genes—with no lysine kinase 1 wnk1 wnk4 kelch-like 3 klhl3 and cullin 3 cul3 —mutations of which all caused pha-ii phenotypes the previous hypothesis was that the klhl3–cul3 ubiquitin complex acted on the wnk4–wnk1 kinase complex to regulate na+/cl− cotransporter ncc mediated salt reabsorption in the distal tubules of the kidney here we report the identification of claudin-8 as a previously unidentified physiologic target for klhl3 and provide an alternative explanation for the collecting duct s role in pha-ii using a tissue-specific ko approach we have found that deletion of claudin-8 in the collecting duct of mouse kidney caused hypotension hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis an exact mirror image of pha-ii mechanistically the phenotypes in claudin-8 ko animals were caused by disruption of the claudin-8 interaction with claudin-4 the paracellular chloride channel and delocalization of claudin-4 from the tight junction in mouse collecting duct cells knockdown of klhl3 profoundly increased the paracellular chloride permeability mechanistically klhl3 was directly bound to claudin-8 and this binding led to the ubiquitination and degradation of claudin-8 the dominant pha-ii mutation in klhl3 impaired claudin-8 binding ubiquitination and degradation these findings have attested to the concept that the paracellular pathway is physiologically regulated through the ubiquitination pathway and its deregulation may lead to diseases of electrolyte and blood pressure imbalances

exon 16 not documented in other family members during the follow-up a progressive increase of urinary metanephrines and catecholamines was recorded our evaluation confirmed the presence of severe hypertension 220/140 mmhg and a severe increase of urinary catecholamines and metanephrines due to the presence of hypokalemia other causes of hypertension were researched leading to the discovery of hyperreninemia 236 μui/ml with mild hyperaldosteronism and a mild increase of the renal artery resistance at ultrasound an abdominal mri showed multiple adrenal masses and a right kidney nodular lesion of about 2 cm the patient underwent bilateral adrenalectomy and right nephrectomy and histology confirmed the presence of bilateral pheochromocytoma and right reninoma the post-surgery laboratory evaluation showed a rapid reduction of the urinary metanephrines while plasma renin level remained low in spite of the bilateral adrenalectomy without any mineralocorticoid supplementation to further investigate these unusual feature we performed genetic testing for the ace gene which revealed the presence of ace i/d polymorphism this unique report describes the association between two

in which presenting symptoms are consistent with cushing syndrome cs we report a new case in which cs triggers the suspicion of an scc of the prostate and a review of the published cases of scc of the prostate presenting with cs the origin of these neoplasms is still unclear it may be suspected when laboratory features appear in patients diagnosed with prostatic adenocarcinoma which becomes resistant to specific therapy scc usually occurs after the 6th decade patients suffering scc of the prostate presenting with cs usually present symptoms such as hypertension hyperglycemia alkalosis or hypokalemia cushingoid phenotype is less frequent cortisol and acth levels are often high prostatic-specific antigen levels are usually normal ct scan is the preferred imaging test to localize the lesion but its performance may be improved by adding other tests such as fdg-pet scan all patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis lymph nodes liver and bone are the most frequent metastases sites surgery and ketokonazole are the preferred treatments for cs the prognosis is very poor 2- and 5-year survival rates are 27.5 and 14.3 respectively key messages when a patient presents with ectopic cushing syndrome but lungs are normal an atypical localization should be suspected we should suspect a prostatic origin if cushing syndrome is accompanied by obstructive inferior urinary tract symptoms or in the setting of a prostatic adenocarcinoma with rapid clinical and radiological progression with relatively low psa levels although no imaging test is preferred to localize these tumors fdg-pet-tc can be very useful hormone marker scintigraphy e.g somatostatin could be used too as cushing syndrome is a paraneoplastic phenomenon treatment of the underlying disease may

control her disease and she was prescribed mifepristone which was titrated to a maximal dosage of 1200 mg daily with subsequent symptom improvement mifepristone ru486 is a high-affinity nonselective antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor there is limited literature on its use as an off-label medication to treat refractory cushing disease over her 8-year treatment with mifepristone her therapy was complicated by hypertension and hypokalemia requiring spironolactone and potassium chloride she received a 2-month drug holiday every 4 to 6 months to allow for withdrawal menstrual bleeding with medroxyprogesterone acetate urinary cortisol serum cortisol and corticotropin levels remained elevated during mifepristone drug holidays while on mifepristone her signs and symptoms of cushing disease resolved repeated magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated stable appearance of the residual pituitary mass bilateral adrenalectomy was performed and mifepristone was discontinued after 95 months of medical therapy we describe the longest duration of mifepristone therapy thus reported for the treatment of refractory cushing disease mifepristone effectively controlled all signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism menstruating women who take the drug on a long-term basis should receive periodic drug holidays to allow for menses the lack of reliable serum biomarkers to monitor the success of

mutations pubmed central al shibli amar narchi hassib 2015-01-01 bartter and gitelman syndromes bs and gs are inherited disorders resulting in defects in renal tubular handling of sodium potassium and chloride previously considered as genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneous diseases recent evidence suggests that they constitute a spectrum of disease caused by different genetic mutations with the molecular defects of chloride reabsorption originating at different sites of the nephron in each condition although they share some characteristic metabolic abnormalities such as hypokalemia metabolic alkalosis hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus with hyperreninemia hyperaldosteronism the clinical and laboratory manifestations may not always allow distinction between them diuretics tests measuring the changes in urinary fractional excretion of chloride from baseline after administration of either hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide show very little change 2.3 in the fractional excretion of chloride from baseline in gs when compared with bs except when bs is associated with kcnj1 mutations where a good response to both diuretics exists the diuretic test is not recommended for infants or young children with suspected bs because of a higher risk of volume depletion in such children clinical symptoms and biochemical markers of gs and classic form of bs type iii may overlap and thus genetic analysis may specify the real cause of symptoms however although genetic analysis is available its use remains limited because of limited availability large gene dimensions lack of hot-spot mutations heavy workup time and costs involved furthermore considerable overlap exists between the different genotypes and phenotypes although bs and gs usually have distinct presentations and are associated with specific gene mutations there remains considerable overlap between their phenotypes and genotypes thus they are better described as a spectrum of clinical manifestations caused by

electrolyte disturbance in cancer development scitech connect nriagu jerome e-mail jnriagu umich.edu this review contends that healthy water in terms of electrolyte balance is as important as pure water in promoting public health it considers the growing use of desalination demineralization technologies in drinking water treatment which often results in tap water with very low concentrations of sodium potassium magnesium and calcium ingestion of such water can lead to electrolyte abnormalities marked by hyponatremia hypokalemia hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which are among the most common and recognizable features in cancer patients the causal relationships between exposure to demineralized water and malignancies are poorly understood this review highlights some of the epidemiological and inmore » vivo evidence that link dysregulated electrolyte metabolism with carcinogenesis and the development of cancer hallmarks it discusses how ingestion of demineralized water can have a procarcinogenic effect through mediating some of the critical pathways and processes in the cancer microenvironment such as angiogenesis genomic instability resistance to programmed cell death sustained proliferative signaling cell immortalization and tumorigenic inflammation evidence that hypoosmotic stress-response processes can upregulate a number of potential oncogenes is well supported by a number studies in view of the rising production and consumption of demineralized water in most parts of the world there is a strong need for further research on the biological importance and protean roles of electrolyte abnormalities in promoting antagonizing or otherwise enabling the development of cancer the countries of the gulf cooperative council gcc where most people consume

thyrotoxic hypokalemic paralysis is the hallmark of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis tpp tpp is a potentially deadly complication of hyperthyroidism that occurs because of rapid and dramatic intracellular shift of potassium this transference results in severe hypokalemia and clinically manifests itself as muscle weakness or paralysis this condition predominantly affects males of asian descent and its presentation can range from mild to severe as seen in our case we present the case of a 15-year-old asian-american male who presented to a tertiary-care pediatric emergency department complaining of generalized weakness and flaccid paralysis of his lower extremities the differential for such a complaint is extremely broad and the symptoms can result from etiologies arising from the cerebral cortex the spinal cord peripheral nerves the neuromuscular junction or even the muscles themselves our patient was found to have an extremely low serum potassium concentration as well as an electrocardiogram that revealed a prolonged qt interval and right bundle branch block the etiology of these abnormalities and the patient 's symptoms was found to be undiagnosed and uncontrolled hyperthyroidism from grave 's disease which resulted in this dramatic presentation of thyrotoxic hypokalemic paralysis why should an emergency physician be aware of this this entity is common in asia but still somewhat rare in the united states and other western countries our case illustrates that careful history taking and a focused diagnostic evaluation in conjunction with having an awareness of this disease can help expedite diagnosis and management as well as avoid unnecessary and potential harmful testing in the emergency department setting copyright © 2016 elsevier inc. all rights

chronic kidney disease ckd hotspots largely due to flooding and agricultural overlaps acute leptospirosis induces multiple organ dysfunction including acute kidney injury and may predispose to ckd and end-stage renal disease if not treated timely asymptomatic infection may carry the bacteria in the kidney and ckd progresses insidiously histologic finding of leptospirosis renal disease includes tubulointerstitial nephritis interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy proximal tubule dysfunction and hypokalemia are observed in adult male workers with leptospirosis a characteristic similarity to ckd unknown etiology ckdu ckdu is a form of ckd that is not attributable to traditional risk factors clustering in agricultural communities affecting young male farmers kidney pathology shows a chronic tubulointerstitial disease ckdu is being reported as an endemic nephropathy across the globe recent surveys suggest that asymptomatic leptospira renal colonization is an overlooked risk for renal fibrosis and ckdu population with anti-leptospira seropositivity is associated with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate in endemic regions and carrier may progress to ckd leptospirosis has been considered as a risk factor for ckdu in sri lanka and in mesoamerican area sugarcane workers in nicaragua showed increased anti-leptospira seropositivity and higher urinary biomarkers for kidney injury emerging evidence with signs of infection were reported in these endemic population indicating that leptospira exposure could play a role in ckdu as a cause of primary kidney disease or

hypokalemia moreover because thiazide diuretics can increase the incidence of new-onset diabetes especially when combined with beta blockers caution is advised in using these drugs above all in patients who are at high risk for developing diabetes in whom thiazide diuretics should be used at the lowest active dose and possibly in combination with drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system finally the current debate on whether thiazide diuretics are the first-choice drug for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension as stated in the seventh joint national committee report or are included in the major classes of antihypertensive agents that are suitable for initiation and maintenance of therapy as reported in the european society of hypertension-european society of cardiology guidelines derives from different interpretations of controlled clinical trial data on drug class comparison and of cost-benefit analyses however considering that the benefit of antihypertensive drugs seems to be due principally to bp lowering per se without definitive evidence of the superiority of a particular drug class and that there is no cost anti-rhodotorula activity of mycophenolic acid enhanced in the presence of polyene antibiotic nystatin pubmed kinoshita h wongsuntornpoj s ihara f nihira t 2017-02-01 rhodotorula species are opportunistic pathogens which cause not only systemic fungaemia but also other localized infections despite serious side effects such as nephrotoxicity and hypokalemia amphotericin b a polyene antifungal has been commonly prescribed for rhodotorula infection because rhodotorula species are resistant against a candin family of antifungal agents in this study novel active compounds against rhodotorula species were screened from the extracts of entomopathogenic fungi based on the synergistic effect of polyene nystatin nys which causes efficient targeting of compounds due to increased permeability through the fungal cell membrane around 37 of culture extracts from 31 entomopathogenic fungal strains showed anti-rhodotorula activity in the synergistic bioassay system suggesting that the coexistence assay with nys enhanced the discovery of anti-rhodotorula compounds judging from various physicochemical data the active component from strain hf763 was identified as an immunosuppressant drug mycophenolic acid mpa the minimum inhibitory concentration of mpa against three pathogenic rhodotorula strains was determined focusing on the synergistic effect with nys the results revealed that the values decreased by at least 87 in the presence of nys indicating that mpa showed a synergistic effect with nys this study aimed to screen active compounds against rhodotorula species that are resistant to a candin family of antifungal agents from entomopathogenic fungi assuming that most of the latent antifungal compounds do not exert their activity due to their inability to penetrate the membrane we took advantage of polyene nystatin in the screening to increase permeability through the fungal cell membrane the result of the screening revealed hidden antifungal activity of mycophenolic acid demonstrating that the method

anigilaje emmanuel ademola 2018-01-01 the survival of a child with severe volume depletion at the emergency department depends on the competency of the first responder to recognize and promptly treat hypovolemic shock although the basic principles on fluid and electrolytes therapy have been investigated for decades the topic remains a challenge as consensus on clinical management protocol is difficult to reach and more adverse events are reported from fluid administration than for any other drug while the old principles proposed by holliday and segar and finberg have stood the test of time recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have highlighted the risk of hyponatraemia and hyponatraemic encephalopathy in some children treated with hypotonic fluids in the midst of conflicting literature on fluid and electrolytes therapy it would appear that isotonic fluids are best suitable for the correction of hypotonic isonatraemic and hypernatraemic dehydration although oral rehydration therapy is adequate to correct mild to moderate isonatraemic dehydration parenteral fluid therapy is safer for the child with severe dehydration and those with changes in serum sodium the article reviews the pathophysiology of water and sodium metabolism and it uses the clinical case examples to illustrate the bed-side approach to the management of three different types of dehydration using a pre-mixed isotonic fluid solution with 20 or 40 mmol/l of potassium chloride added depending on the absence or presence of hypokalemia respectively when 3 sodium chloride is unavailable to treat hyponatraemic encephalopathy 0.9 sodium chloride becomes inevitable albeit a closer monitoring of serum sodium is required the importance of a keen and regular clinical and laboratory monitoring

months after initial diagnosis differences between disease and survival groups were evaluated for significance overall more female cats and middle-aged cats were affected presenting complaints of vomiting anorexia weakness and weight loss were common physical assessment of most cats showed obvious hepatomegaly jaundice dehydration and a weight loss or 25 of usual body weight neurobehavioral signs indicative of hepatic encephalopathy other than ptyalism and depression were rare clinicopathologic features are characterized by hyperbilirubinemia and increased activities of serum alt ast and alp with only small if any increase in gamma gt activity clinical features distinguishing cats with hepatic lipidosis from those with other serious cholestatic disorders include absence of hyperglobulinemia and low gamma gt activity relative to alp activity although coagulation tests were abnormal in 45 of cats tested n 44 few cats showed clinical bleeding tendencies most cats received prophylactic vitamin k1 therapy forty two cats received aggressive nutritional and supportive care and of these 55 survived cats with idiopathic disease were significantly younger had significantly

refeeding management of anorexia nervosa inpatients an evidence-based protocol pubmed hofer michael pozzi antonio joray maya ott rebecca hähni florence leuenberger michéle von känel roland stanga zeno 2014-05-01 anorexia nervosa is associated with several serious medical complications related to malnutrition severe weight loss and low levels of micronutrients the refeeding phase of these high-risk patients bears a further threat to health and potentially fatal complications the objective of this study was to examine complications due to refeeding of patients with anorexia nervosa as well as their mortality rate after the implementation of guidelines from the european society of clinical nutrition and metabolism we analyzed retrospective observational data of a consecutive unselected anorexia nervosa cohort during a 5-y period the sample consisted of 65 inpatients 14 were admitted more than once within the study period resulting in 86 analyzed cases minor complications associated with refeeding during the first 10 d replenishing phase were recorded in nine cases 10.5 four with transient pretibial edemas and three with organ dysfunction in two cases a severe hypokalemia occurred during the observational phase of 30 d 16 minor complications occurred in 14 cases 16.3 six infectious and 10 non-infectious complications occurred none of the patients with anorexia nervosa died within a follow-up period of 3 mo our data demonstrate that the seriousness and rate of complications during the replenishment phase in this high-risk population can be kept to a minimum the findings indicate that evidence-based refeeding regimens such as our guidelines are able to reduce complications and prevent mortality despite anorexia nervosa our sample were affected by serious

of severe hyponatraemia in hyperemesis gravidarum pubmed central 2014-01-01 background osmotic demyelination syndrome ods may be observed as a result of a rapid change in serum osmolarity such as that induced by an overly rapid correction of serum sodium levels in hyponatraemic patients case presentation we describe the case of a 21-year-old woman who was hospitalized at week 10 of gestation because of severe hyperemesis at admission the patient appeared restless and confused and severe hyponatraemia serum sodium 107 mmol/l and hypokalemia serum potassium 1.1 mmol/l were detected active and simultaneous correction of these imbalances led to an overly rapid increase of serum sodium levels 17 mmol/l in the first 24 hours isotonic saline solution was stopped and replaced by 5 dextrose solution infusion however the neurological alterations worsened and the radiological features were consistent with the diagnosis of extra-pontine ods steroids were administered intravenously with progressive improvement of biochemical and clinical abnormalities at the time of discharge 20 days later the patient was able to walk and eat autonomously with only minimal external support conclusions this report illustrates an unusual case of ods occurred after an excessive rate of correction of hyponatraemia obtained with isotonic saline infusion hypokaliemia and its active correction very likely played a crucial role in facilitating the onset of ods this interesting aspect will be explained in detail in the article a more cautious and thoughtful correction of electrolyte alterations would have probably prevented the onset of ods in this patient physicians should be aware of the possibly fatal consequences that an exceedingly rapid change of serum osmolarity may have and should strictly follow the known safety measures in order to prevent it to occur pmid:24725751 evidence for an increased rate of cardiovascular events in patients with primary aldosteronism pubmed

aldosterone-producing adenoma apa and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia during a three-year period the diagnosis of pa was made in 124 of 5,500 patients referred for comprehensive evaluation and management adenomas were diagnosed in 65 patients and idiopathic hyperaldosteronism in 59 patients during the same period clinical characteristics and cardiovascular events of this group were compared with those of 465 patients with essential hypertension eht randomly matched for age gender and systolic and diastolic blood pressure a history of stroke was found in 12.9 of patients with pa and 3.4

findings he had massive bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and underwent left adrenalectomy kcnj5 was sequenced and secretion of aldosterone and cortisol were observed both in vivo and in vitro results a heterozygous germline p.glu145gln mutation of kcnj5 was identified armc5 prkar1a pde8b pde11a and prkaca genes and β-catenin p53 immunoactivity were normal in the adrenal cyp11b2 was highly expressed whereas mrna expression of cyp11b1 cyp17a1 and star was relatively low in the hyperplastic adrenal compared with normal adrenal cortex and other adrenal diseases in the primary cell culture of the resected hyperplastic adrenal verapamil and nifedipine two calcium channel blockers markedly inhibited the secretion of both aldosterone and cortisol and the mrna expression of cyp11b1 cyp11b2 cyp17a1 and star conclusions we presented the first fh-iii patient who had both severe pa and cushing 's syndrome hypersecretion of cortisol might be ascribed to overly large size of the hyperplastic adrenal because cyp11b1 expression was relatively low in his adrenal like aldosterone synthesis and secretion of cortisol in the mutant adrenal may be mediated by voltage-gated ca2+ channels pmid:27403928 a

one of the largest series described by comparing with other published populations and considering that 80 of our patients presented the p.ala204thr spanish founder mutation presumably associated with a common phenotype we aimed to test the hypothesis that allelic differences could explain the wide phenotypic variability observed in patients with type iii bs methods clinical data were retrieved from the referral centers the exon regions and flanking intronic sequences of the clcnkb gene were screened for mutations by polymerase chain reaction pcr followed by direct sanger sequencing presence of gross deletions or duplications in the region was checked for by mlpa and qmpsf analyses results polyuria polydipsia and dehydration were the main common symptoms metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia of renal origin were detected in all patients at diagnosis calciuria levels were variable hypercalciuria was detected in 31 of patients while 23 had hypocalciuria nephrocalcinosis was diagnosed in 20 of the cohort two novel clcnkb mutations were identified a small homozygous deletion c.753delg in one patient and a small deletion c.1026delc in another the latter was present in

the effect of chronic antihypertensive medication on confirmatory testing results to allow the results to be interpreted the reproducibility of confirmatory testing was also evaluated design and methods the study enrolled 114 individuals with suspected pa who underwent two confirmatory tests the patients were divided into two groups in group a both tests were performed on the guidelines-recommended therapy i.e not interfering with the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system in group b the first test was performed on chronic therapy with the exclusion of thiazides loop diuretics and aldosterone antagonists and the second test was performed on guidelines-recommended therapy saline infusion preceded by oral sodium loading was used to suppress aldosterone secretion results agreement in the interpretation of the two confirmatory tests was observed in 84 and 66 of patients in groups a and b respectively for all 20 individuals in group a who ever had end-test serum aldosterone levels ≥240 pmol/l aldosterone was concordantly nonsuppressible during the other test similarly for all 16 individuals in group b who had end-test serum aldosterone levels ≥240 pmol/l on modified chronic therapy aldosterone remained nonsuppressible with guidelines-recommended therapy conclusion confirmatory testing performed while the patient is on chronic therapy without diuretics and aldosterone antagonists can confirm the diagnosis of pa provided serum aldosterone remains markedly elevated at the end of saline infusion pmid:22253400 sodium polystyrene sulfonate for the

especially those with underlying chronic kidney disease but evidence-based guidelines for its treatment are lacking sodium polystyrene sulfonate sps a cation exchange resin first approved by the fda for the treatment of hyperkalemia in 1958 is frequently used alone or in conjunction with other medical therapies to lower serum potassium recently the safety and efficacy of sps have come into question based on multiple reported cases of bowel necrosis associated with sps administration the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the use of sps for the treatment of hyperkalemia at a large tertiary community teaching hospital to determine its effectiveness and the incidence of related adverse side effects a retrospective chart review was performed on all adult inpatients receiving single-dose sps at a 466-bed tertiary community teaching hospital over a 3-year period 501 patients received sps for the treatment of hyperkalemia during their index hospital stay serum potassium levels decreased by 0.93 meq/l on average at first recheck after sps administration with or without additional medical treatments our study identified 10 cases of hypernatremia greater than 145 meq/l 31 cases of hypokalemia less than 3.5 meq/l and 2 cases of bowel necrosis related to the administration of sps our results suggest a serum potassium reduction of less than 1 meq/l after administration of sps for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia additionally this study offers some evidence that the use of sps may be associated with harm we further note the need for standardized guidelines for the

adults with lower serum potassium levels and lower dietary potassium intake are at higher risk for incident diabetes independent of diuretic use methods we analyzed data from 12,209 participants from the atherosclerosis risk in communities aric study an on-going prospective cohort study beginning in 1986 with 9 years of in-person follow-up and 17 years of telephone follow-up using multivariate cox proportional hazard models we estimated the relative hazard rh of incident diabetes associated with baseline serum potassium levels results during 9 years of in-person follow-up 1475 participants developed incident diabetes in multivariate analyses we found an inverse association between serum potassium and risk of incident diabetes compared to those with a high-normal serum potassium 5.0-5.5 meq/l adults with serum potassium levels of 4.0 4.0- 4.5 and 4.5- 5.0 meq/l had adjusted relative hazards rh 95 ci of incident diabetes of 1.64 1.29-2.08 1.64 1.34-2.01 and 1.39 1.14-1.71 respectively an increased risk persisted during an additional 8 years of telephone follow-up based on self-report with rhs of 1.2-1.3 for those with a serum potassium less than 5.0 meq/l dietary potassium intake was significantly associated with risk of incident diabetes in unadjusted models but not in multivariate models conclusions serum potassium is an independent predictor of incident diabetes in this

humans and animals including those associated with polyuria e.g urinary tract obstruction hypokalemia inflammation and lithium toxicity and dilutional hyponatremia e.g siadh normal regulation of aqp2 by vasopressin involves two independent regulatory mechanisms 1 short-term regulation of aqp2 trafficking to and from the apical plasma membrane and 2 long term regulation of the total abundance of the aqp2 protein in the cells most water balance disorders are the result of dysregulation of processes that regulate the total abundance of aqp2 in collecting duct cells in general the level of aqp2 in a collecting duct cell is determined by a balance between production via translation of aqp2 mrna and removal via degradation and/or secretion into the urine in exosomes aqp2 abundance increases in response to vasopressin chiefly due to increased translation subsequent to increases in aqp2 mrna vasopressin-mediated regulation aqp2 gene transcription is poorly understood although several transcription factor binding elements in the 5 flanking region of the aqp2 gene have been identified and candidate transcription factors corresponding to these element have been discovered in proteomics studies here we review progress in this area and discuss elements of vasopressin signaling in the collecting duct that may impinge on regulation of aqp2 in health and in the context of

cotransporter ncc in distal convoluted tubule dct plays important roles in renal nacl reabsorption the current hypothesis for the mechanism of regulation of ncc focuses on wnk4 and intracellular cl concentration cl i wnk kinases bind cl and cl binding decreases the catalytic activity it is believed that hypokalemia under low k intake decreases cl i to activate wnk4 which thereby phosphorylates and stimulates ncc through activation of spak however increased ncc activity and apical nacl entry would mitigate the fall in cl i whether cl i in dct under low-k diet is sufficiently low to activate wnk4 is unknown furthermore increased luminal nacl delivery also stimulates ncc and causes upregulation of the transporter unlike low k intake increased luminal nacl delivery would tend to increase cl i thus we investigated the role of wnk4 and cl i in regulating ncc we generated wnk4-knockout mice and examined regulation of ncc by low k intake and by increased luminal nacl delivery in knockout ko and wild-type mice wnk4-ko mice have marked reduction in the abundance phosphorylation and functional activity of ncc vs. wild type low k intake increases ncc phosphorylation and functional activity in wild-type mice but not in wnk4-ko mice increased luminal nacl delivery similarly upregulates ncc which contrary to low k intake is not abolished in wnk4-ko mice the results reveal that modulation of wnk4 activity by cl i is not the sole mechanism for regulating ncc increased luminal nacl delivery upregulates ncc via yet unknown mechanism s that may override inhibition of wnk4 by high cl i

zhong-xiuzi lin dao-hong mccormick james a yang chao-ling wang wen-hui ellison david h 2018-04-01 kir4.1 in the distal convoluted tubule plays a key role in sensing plasma potassium and in modulating the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter ncc here we tested whether dietary potassium intake modulates kir4.1 and whether this is essential for mediating the effect of potassium diet on ncc high potassium intake inhibited the basolateral 40 ps potassium channel a kir4.1/5.1 heterotetramer in the distal convoluted tubule decreased basolateral potassium conductance and depolarized the distal convoluted tubule membrane in kcnj10flox/flox mice herein referred to as control mice in contrast low potassium intake activated kir4.1 increased potassium currents and hyperpolarized the distal convoluted tubule membrane these effects of dietary potassium intake on the basolateral potassium conductance and membrane potential in the distal convoluted tubule were completely absent in inducible kidney-specific kir4.1 knockout mice furthermore high potassium intake decreased whereas low potassium intake increased the abundance of ncc expression only in the control but not in kidney-specific kir4.1 knockout mice renal clearance studies demonstrated that low potassium augmented while high potassium diminished hydrochlorothiazide-induced natriuresis in control mice disruption of kir4.1 significantly increased basal urinary sodium excretion but it abolished the natriuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazide finally hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis in kidney-specific kir4.1 knockout mice were exacerbated by potassium restriction and only partially corrected by a high-potassium diet thus kir4.1 plays an essential role in mediating the effect of

developing hypertension as demonstrated in former studies using global and brain-specific hsd11b2 knockout rodents to re-examine the importance of renal dysfunction on developing hypertension we generated kidney-specific hsd11b2 knockout mice the knockout mice exhibited systemic hypertension which was abolished by reducing salt intake suggesting its salt-dependency in addition we detected an increase in renal membrane expressions of cleaved epithelial sodium channel-α and t53-phosphorylated na -cl cotransporter in the knockout mice acute intraperitoneal administration of amiloride-induced natriuresis and increased urinary sodium/potassium ratio more in the knockout mice compared with those in the wild-type control mice chronic administration of amiloride and high-kcl diet significantly decreased mean blood pressure in the knockout mice which was accompanied with the correction of hypokalemia and the resultant decrease in na -cl cotransporter phosphorylation accordingly a na -cl cotransporter blocker hydrochlorothiazide significantly decreased mean blood pressure in the knockout mice chronic administration of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone significantly decreased mean blood pressure of the knockout mice along with downregulation of cleaved epithelial sodium channel-α and phosphorylated na -cl cotransporter expression in the knockout kidney our data suggest that kidney-specific deficiency of 11β-hsd2 leads to salt-dependent hypertension which is attributed to mineralocorticoid receptor-epithelial sodium channel-na -cl cotransporter activation in

47-year-old male with a history of heart failure with new york heart association class iii-iv symptoms presented to our institution with ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia storm torsade de pointes secondary to a combination of dofetilide and hypokalemia was determined to be the etiology upon stabilization the patient was initiated on dronedarone 400 mg orally twice daily by the electrophysiology service for atrial fibrillation the patient had a questionable history of amiodarone intolerance by hospital day 9 day 4 of dronedarone therapy the patient demonstrated a clinical picture consistent with acute renal and hepatic failure possibly due to worsening heart failure dronedarone was discontinued on hospital day 10 he was subsequently transferred to an outside hospital where he required milrinone therapy for cardiogenic shock laboratory markers of renal and hepatic function improved over the remainder of his hospitalization and he was discharged on hospital day 20 dronedarone is a newly approved antiarrhythmic agent with multichannel blocking properties similar to amiodarone use of the naranjo probability scale determined that this patient 's worsening heart failure leading to acute renal and hepatic failure was possibly caused by dronedarone the implication from the andromeda trial as well as our experience in this case is that dronedarone should be used cautiously in patients with heart failure and avoided in patients specifically outlined in the product labeling this case report to our knowledge represents the first published postmarketing

biochemical and hematological characteristics disease prevalence and prognosis of dogs presenting with neutrophil cytoplasmic toxicity pubmed aroch itamar klement eyal segev gilad 2005-01-01 neutrophil cytoplasmic toxicity is manifested as an abnormality in cell size or the cytoplasmic content upon examination of romanowsky-stained blood smears and is traditionally associated with infection and inflammation the purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the association of such changes with clinical and clinicopathologic characteristics diseases and prognoses in dogs dogs with neutrophil toxicity n 248 were compared with negative controls n 248 statistical analyses included chi-square tests independent t-tests nonparametric mann-whitney tests the chi-square trend

tool to reduce patient hazards pubmed ofek fanny magnezi racheli kurzweil yaffa gazit inbal berkovitch sofia tal orna 2016-01-01 intravenous potassium chloride iv kcl solutions are widely used in hospitals for treatment of hypokalemia as ampoules of concentrated kcl must be diluted before use critical incidents have been associated with its preparation and administration currently we have introduced ready-to-use diluted kcl infusion solutions to minimize the use of high-alert concentrated kcl since this process may be associated with considerable risks we embraced a proactive hazard analysis as a tool to implement a change in high-alert drug usage in a hospital setting failure mode and effect analysis fmea is a systematic tool to analyze and identify risks in system operations we used fmea to examine the hazards associated with the implementation of the ready-to-use solutions a multidisciplinary team analyzed the risks by identifying failure modes conducting a hazard analysis and calculating the criticality index ci for each failure mode a 1-day survey was performed as an evaluation step after a trial run period of approximately 4 months six major possible risks were identified the most severe risks were prioritized and specific recommendations were formulated out of 28 patients receiving iv kcl on the day of the survey 22 received the ready-to-use solutions and 6 received the concentrated solutions as instructed only 1 patient received inappropriate ready-to-use kcl using the fmea tool in our study has proven once again that by creating a gradient of severity of potential vulnerable elements we are able to proactively promote safer and more efficient processes in health care systems this article presents a utilization of this method for implementing a change in hospital policy regarding the routine use of iv kcl hematological biochemical and histopathological impacts of barium chloride and barium carbonate accumulation in soft tissues of male sprague-dawley rats pubmed mohammed amany tharwat ismail hager tarek h 2017-12-01 the present study was designed to investigate the hematotoxicity sero-biochemical and histological changes due to the accumulation of bacl 2 and baco 3 the most important barium salts in our daily lives in different soft tissues including the liver kidney heart and spleen of adult rats after an oral exposure for 30 consecutive days and to explain the different mechanisms by which this metal can exert these impacts for this purpose adult male rats were divided into three main groups of 15 animals each group i serving as controls group ii receiving bacl 2 orally in a dose of 179 mg barium/kg b.wt and group iii receiving baco 3 orally in a dose of 418 mg barium/kg b.wt for 30 consecutive days obviously normocytic normochromic anemia was evident in both barium groups serum biochemical analysis revealed significant declines in glutathione peroxidase catalase superoxide dismutase and urea with significant elevations in malondialdehyde lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels hyperphosphatemia hypokalemia hypocalcemia and hypochloremia were also evident in both barium groups besides residual analysis of both barium salts in different body organs revealed significantly abundant barium residues in the liver spleen heart and kidney respectively in both barium salts groups moreover splenic tissue showed hemosiderosis peritubular congestion and necrotic glomeruli with intratubular hemorrhage sever subepicardial congestion with intramuscular edema was evident in the heart in conclusion bacl 2 and baco 3 were able to deliver mortalities antioxidant enzymes exhaustion and a sort of normocytic normochromic anemia as well as marked disturbances in cardiac hepatic and renal functions due to the accumulation of these two salts in the soft tissues therefore these results demonstrate the unrecognized toxicity of those two barium salts due to their accumulation in various

rationale glycyrrhizin is the main active component of licorice licorice and glycyrrhizin induced hypertension has been widely reported yet licorice and glycyrrhizin induced hypertensive crisis has been rarely known patient concerns the case of this report was a 47-year-old woman who took 225 mg of glycyrrhizin daily for 3 years due to primary biliary cholangitis she was found to have a dramatically elevated blood pressure of about 230/110 mmhg without a history of hypertension and was referred to the emergency department diagnoses hypokalemia hypertensive retinopathy and nephropathy were found during the following work-up since no other risk factors of hypertension were identified she was suspected to have glycyrrhizin induced pseudo-hyperaldosteronism interventions glycyrrhizin was discontinued intravenous sodium nitroprusside was used during the first few days nifedipine and irbesartan were taken after discharge and the dosage was reduced gradually under supervision outcomes she stopped all the anti-hypertensive drugs 6 months since glycyrrhizin was stopped her blood pressure was about 110/60 mmhg after repetitive measurement her serum potassium and urine albumin/creatinine ratio were also normalized lessons licorice and glycyrrhizin induced hypertension due to pseudo-hyperaldosteronism has been widely reported yet only 3 cases reported that excessive consumption of licorice could lead to hypertensive emergencies this is the first case that glycyrrhizin induced hypertensive crisis with target organ impairment by presenting this case we remind

late 1980s in japan and the bupleuri radix related adverse drug reaction adr reports in china after careful review comparison analysis and evaluation we think the interstitial pneumonitis drug induced liver injury dili and other severe adverse drug envents ades including death happened in japan is probably results from multiple factors including combinatory use of xchde with interferon kampo usage under modern medicine theory guidance and use of xchd on the basis of disease diagnosis instead of traditional chinese syndrome complex differentiation there are less ade case reports related to xchd preparation in china compared to japan mostly manifest with hypersensitivity responses of skin and perfuse perspiration the symptoms of radix bupleuri injection related ades mainly manifest hypersensitivity-like response 2 cases of intravenous infusion instead of intramuscular injection developed hypokalemia and renal failure one case died from severe hypersensitivity shock in chinese literatures there is no report of the interstitial pneumonitis and dili associated with xchdg in japan so far there is no voluntary monitoring data and large sample clinical research data available the author elaborated the classification of reevaluation and clarified re-evaluation upon events included the reaction to the suspected safety and efficacy events based on the current status of the clinical research on the radix bupleuri preparations the author points out that post-marketing re-evaluation upon suspected event is not only a necessity of continuous evaluation of the safety efficacy of drugs it is also a necessity for providing objective clinical research data to share with the international and domestic drug administrations in the risk-benefit evaluation it is also the

maintenance of blood pressure is still accomplished in only a minority of hypertensives long-term trials employing a combination of drugs i.e. diuretics vasodilators and reserpine and subsequently beta-blockers almost without fail have not shown that treatment with these agents significantly reduces heart disease mortality and sudden death this has been attributed perhaps without basis to an
