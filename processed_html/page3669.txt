Cranston, RI Bachelor of Arts in History with a minor in Irish Studies from Fordham University. As a former student ambassador, I love working with families and students while they go through this exciting process. I love FSC s mission of engaged learning and am excited to share it with prospective students! A lunch downtown in one of our awesome independently owned restaurants and then reading a good book out in the sunshine! I m a history buff, so I love walking around campus under the Esplanades they are awesome historical Wright structures that really contribute to the unique look of Florida Southern. Black and Brew and Frescos are cool places to grab a great and nutritious lunch! I love reading especially books about interesting periods in history. I m also an amateur genealogist and enjoy traveling. Now that I m a Floridian, I ve made it my mission to spend as much time outdoors as I possibly can look for me at the beach or Disney!
