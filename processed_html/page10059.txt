The board Tuesday night voted 7-0 to follow Superintendent Stephen Murley’s recommendation that there be no changes in elementary school and junior high attendance zones in the 2013-14 school year. One exception may be sending children from the Lake Ridge neighborhood in southern Iowa City to Hills Elementary School instead of Twain Elementary, where they go now. Redistricting, as the process is known, was  proposed by Murley’s administration in early March  to ease overcrowding at Wood Elementary in Iowa City and North Central Junior High in North Liberty. To do that, several other schools would have had their boundaries changed. But the superintendent said Tuesday that reaction from the public caused him to recommend the board pull back. Murley said several themes arose at forums and through other feedback: Murley said the planning process will require the school board to either reaffirm the 2010 vote to eventually build a third comprehensive high school or take the steps to allow West High and City High to handle increasing enrollment. A district committee studying a new high school is expected to submit its report soon, with the school board likely discussing it in June. Murley said the district has identified five available temporary facilities to help ease overcrowding now at Wood, Penn and Lemme elementary schools.In the Lake Ridge mobile home park neighborhood, Murley said many parents have expressed an interest in being in the Hills Elementary attendance zone. Administrators want more time to talk with parents before making a recommendation, he said.
