Japan Tourist Attraction Pass? - Japan Forum - TripAdvisor I was wondering if  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-31001040', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Japan  has a pass one can buy that will give free or discounted admission to tourist attractions around the country? For example, the British heritage pass allows for free entry to over 480 UK heritage properties. I am looking for something comparable in Japan. I have found the  Tokyo  Grutt Museum Pass, Welcome Cards, and the  Kansai  Grutt Museum Pass for different regions of Japan but these cards are geared toward museums. I will spending most of my time at shrines, castles, and temples. Any ideas? Thanks for the help! It is good to note that the vast majority of Shrines and Temple grounds are free to enter. Yes there are some that do require a few hundred yen to enter inside, however I don ' t think it ' s warranted enough to have a entire nationwide pass for. I agree with tokyosubway. You won ' t be going to museums so the passes you mentioned won ' t be helpful. You only need to pay a small fee to enter some of the more major temples, shrines and castles. The huge savings for tourists is the  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-31003743', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Japan  Rail Pass so you can ride around the country using that and will save a lot of money. Okay thanks. I figured I would be spending about 250 for all the sites. I just wanted to make sure I was not missing out on a discount card. 250 US dollars?? 2 Day Unlimited pass in  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-31005649', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Osaka -Y2700 includes subway for 2 days and free admission to a number of places including  Osaka Castle , observation towers, a few  cruises , etc. (and yes, some museums) www.pia-kansai.ne.jp/osp/en/03_kukan.php http://www.pia-kansai.ne.jp/osp/en/05_a.php Yes, 250 usd. That is what I calculated I would spend to see all the sights on my list. thanks mapleg I will look into that pass. Wish every city had a pass like that. -:- Message from TripAdvisor staff -:- This topic has been closed to new posts due to inactivity.
