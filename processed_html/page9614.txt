Syllabus  &  Statutes   5th IOAA - Poland 2011 5th International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics The  International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics , or IOAA,  is an annual event in which high school students from around the world compete against each other, solving theoretical, analytical and observational problems in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics. The  5 th  IOAA   was held in Poland from  25th August to 3rd September 2011 , in and around the cities of  Katowice ,  Chorzów  and  Kraków . Despite  being relatively young compared to the other recognized International  Science Olympiads (the first was held in 2007), the high standards of  the Olympiad and the work it does to promote astronomy education,  particularly in regions with emerging astronomy programmes, have gained  the support of  the President and Commission 46 of  International  Astronomical Union and of national governments of participating  countries. The organisation and statues of the IOAA are based on those  of the long-running International Physics Olympiad.   Each IOAA  is organised under the auspices of the Ministry of Education of the  host country and lasts for ten days. Participating countries each send  one team of up to five students (still attending or having just finished  high school) and two adult team leaders, who approve the problems and  translate them into the native languages of the students. Accomodation  and participation costs during the ten days are covered by the  organisers for the seven team members. Teams pay for travel to the host  country, and for any extra persons ('observers') or accomodation beyond  this period.   Come and visit the IOAA page on  Facebook !
