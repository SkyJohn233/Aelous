Drum Kits From Junk With A Korg Electribe ES-1 Sampler | Synthtopia Sunday Synth Jam : This video, via  once upon a synth , captures a sampling synth jam, featuring an old Korg Electribe ES-1 and a bunch of household junk. I sample random objects I found around the house into the Korg ES-1 sampler and attempt to make some lo-fi techno. Objets include a coke can, a book, a banana, a kleenex box, a camera, a lighter, etc. This is a fun way to create your own lo-fi drum kits and end up with unique and interesting sounds that you can layer in with real drum hits to add a bit of flavor. Technical Details: This video captures a polyrhythmic synth jam, featuring Squarp Pyramid, Novation Circuit, Moog Sub 37, PreenFM2, Rhodes, Minifooger Delay, and Korg KP3+.

This is the kind of things I d like to do when I m an adult Reply Am i see this right, there is a tiny person dancing in the display screen?  Reply Love my Korg ES-1 Reply I really need to use my ES-1 more. Iâ€™ve hardly used it in years.   Reply Korg ES-1 actually goes for fair prices nowadays compares to ESX-1, but I think you are better off with the new Electribe Sampler 2 Reply This machine is all you need. Super demo! Reply Damn, that s a well made  &  used sample bank! Pretty inspirational stuff, the old Electribes are incredibly intuitive machines. Wish that kind of workflow was added to more new synths  &  grooveboxes. Reply Name* E-Mail* Website Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. Publish
