wota in translation » morning musume 20th anniversary official book interviews niigaki risa niigaki risa october 20 1988 — kanagawa 2001/08/26 2012/05/18 niigaki some time ago i was doing a shoot for a tv program where they had pictures from the times of our respective debuts lined up and i realized how the members in them all looked different depending on the era i don t just mean our makeup and our hairstyles but the whole feel of the pictures themselves 20 years it really is a piece of history i was a member of the group for half of that 10 years the beginning was so incredibly difficult for me but i think if i had to choose it was the latter half of my time as a member that left the bigger impression on me this was when we were the seniors when our seniors had all left and it was up to just me and ai-chan to take responsibility of morning musume that was the era of my morning musume life that to me felt the most profound — you joined the group in 2001 the☆peace was a hit and the group was smack in the middle of its golden era niigaki i loved morning musume my first impression of them was that it was this group of older girls singing really cool mature songs and then when the 4th generation joined i came to like them even more since they were around the same age as me that s when i first started going to their concerts too you couldn t apply to their auditions until you were in junior high school so i just waited patiently until that day and i let my parents know i wanted to apply — were they supportive of you wanting to do so niigaki no this was right around the time of my midterm exams so initially i just gave up when they told me to stop dreaming and focus on my studies but then i begged them one more time just before the deadline and my application made it in just in time at the auditions i went into this conference room type place where they called us by our numbers one-by-one there even were some auditionees there who had come from overseas i was shocked by just how many people there were i was later told that there had apparently been over 25,000 applicants — despite there being so many rivals all around you were you still confident that you would pass the audition niigaki the only thing that got me in was my love of the group i was no good at either singing or dancing so it s not that i was confident at all it was just i love morning musume i want in that s what i conveyed to them during the interview when they asked me what i would say if they wanted me to have a solo debut instead i just answered i want to join morning musume baptism by fire — the atmosphere at such a large-scale audition must have been quite menacing niigaki i actually expected worse but it really wasn t. everyone got along pretty well in fact it was to the point that when we were in the bus headed to the training camp we were talking to each other so happily that the staff had to tell us to be quiet plus a lot of us were so carefree if there was something one of us couldn t do we d all help each other out it wasn t like a group of rivals trying to outdo one another instead everyone felt like they were their own biggest enemy — were you friendly with the other three from your generation since the very beginning niigaki rather than friendly it was more we wanted to do our best together we were excited to be accepted into the group but then it became super intense starting with our very first day as members it was just very physically demanding and none of us could do anything properly at first i very quickly learned that it was because the group was always going through all this extremely demanding training that they were able to shine so brightly on stage we had a strong emotional attachment to every single song of ours and even all our choreographies had meanings literally down to the degree to which we d have to point our fingertips or something we were immediately taught that there was zero compromise when it gave to the group s performances — wasn t the difference in skill between you and your seniors overwhelming did you not feel like just running away niigaki for the first month or so the four of us were constantly doing basic training so we didn t even realize it at first but when we finally started our activities together the difference between us and the rest of the members was so immense that i was just shocked the biggest thing was how fast they were at learning our seniors could master all sorts of thing in an instant while the four of us would be seriously struggling both their speed and the quality of their learning it was all completely beyond my expectations i felt this huge pressure to do better because otherwise no one was ever going to acknowledge us and not just with the dancing but the singing as well it was so much work for us it wasn t easy — amidst all that on mr. moonlight ~ai no big band~ the first song you took part in you got to sing that opening line ai wo kudasai niigaki that made me happy the four of us went in to record the song and tsunku♂ was there to listen to us sing it one-by-one it felt like a test of some sort ultimately it was my version of the line that was used my voice had been selected to be the very first sound on my debut single a cd of my beloved morning musume it really did feel like a dream — you got the part on the cd but i ve heard it was even more difficult for you during tv recordings and such niigaki the four of us in the 5th generation would take turns in singing the line at our tv and concert performances standing there all by yourself at the very beginning of the song it was quite a lot of pressure i was always nervous about when it would be my turn next hiro 2 13k subscribers subscribe 01年モーニング娘。11月mr

making mistakes niigaki that s why i was so afraid of tv shoots at the time and i was nervous before concerts too the four of us would often be in the dressing room practicing just the ai wo kudasaiiiii ♪ part we were always having trouble with it lots of times we d cause trouble for everyone because they d have to stop filming because of us thinking back i m glad that phrase was at the beginning of the song i can only imagine how strained the atmosphere would ve been if the group had been repeatedly told to redo it after having made it to the very end of the song — in all honesty would bad takes like that result in the mood within the group becoming hostile niigaki no it was okay our seniors were so kind to us they d teach us their tricks try doing it like this maybe that d help you do it of course when we were being just hopeless they would obviously get angry or give us some words of caution but they were always quick to forgive our seniors really were so kind — despite your seniors being so welcoming the 5th generation was thought of as being somehow unmotivated weren t you niigaki for me the person i was the most scared of was our dance instructor natsu mayumi dancing was so difficult to me i just couldn t keep up at all she d have to stop the lessons countless of times because of me being told to your face that you re the only one who isn t able to do it properly would make me that much more stressed about it and that would then make things go from bad to worse mentally i knew what i had to do but my body just wasn t able to keep up — it must have been a burden on an unexperienced 12-year-old suddenly being given all these tasks to accomplish niigaki no i think it might actually be the opposite maybe i was able to endure it all because i was a 12-year-old all i could do at the time was to throw caution to the wind and give it my all i had no time to be thinking about anything besides that i was able to get over so many things simply by thinking i have to do this and not be a nuisance to anyone else — according to takahashi there were times when everyone in the 5th generation was feeling so down you came this close to just running away from the group niigaki oh yeah with those three absolutely laughs the other three were all so negative there were many times when i just thought if this goes on we re done for one time when we left the rehearsal room and we were walking towards the bathroom there was this window on the way i don t remember which one of us said it but someone uttered that they wanted to escape through that window i don t know if they really meant it or not but that s how cornered they felt — so you personally didn t feel that it was quite that serious for you niigaki i was still living at home and attending the same school as before so my environment hadn t changed all that much despite me joining morning musume but as for the other three they all had to move in from outside of tokyo they lost their old schools all their friends and then on top of that they found themselves in this all-new difficult situation i really felt so bad for them for a long while there as for me though i did feel like quitting near the very beginning once i decided that i was going to do my best no matter what i never felt down like that again — it must have been especially difficult for you what with the misunderstanding that surfaced right after you had joined the group niigaki prior to joining morning musume i had passed a certain audition and i got to appear on a tv commercial i wasn t a part of any agency i had done it as a private individual yet people mistook it as me having been able to join the group all because of some sort of a connection so they started bashing me all of a sudden it felt like i was starting in the group from a losing position people at our concerts would be cheering on the other three when they were doing their self-introductions yet they would start booing during mine they would hold up signs that said hurtful things about me — even though you had finally found yourself in this place of your dreams it must have been painful and to think that you had been just an average girl only a short time prior to that it must have been so disheartening for you niigaki that s how much everyone was paying attention to this place that everyone yearned for i was quickly made aware of the fact that i was going to have to work so much harder than i thought if i wanted anyone to acknowledge me with that said there were times when i just couldn t take it anymore times when it was so painful i wanted to quit but there were some fans cheering on even someone like me so i managed to change my mind and keep trying my best for the sake of those fans — i would imagine that it isn t easy to get over trauma like that niigaki after some years had passed people were no longer saying things like that about me but deep down i still felt worried about it it was only when i got to show myself graduate after having spent 10 years in the group and everyone was cheering for me that i attained this peace of mind i ve finally been accepted as part of morning musume — did your generation-mates know about all this niigaki no i never told anyone that i wanted to quit so i m sure they didn t know but while i never discussed this with the other three it was because they were there for me that i was able to overcome it they may not have known about the state i was in but just having these friends doing their best by my side was enough encouragement for me the bonds with junjun and linlin — your looks too would go on to change during those 10 years in the beginning you were known for your prominent eyebrows and your center-split twin tails niigaki to this day i continue to resent the office for that hairstyle laughs that mother of ultra hair i was told to have that hairstyle by the office folks and even now in hindsight it s not the least bit cute at the time i just did as i was told without questioning anything okay got it still though that was just terrible laughs back then they were constantly telling us to have personality and not having the same hairstyle as someone else was one of the first things you would do to make yourself stand out that s why my hair ended up like that — it feels like it d be a huge deal if a new member now had hair like that niigaki i know right laughs at the time it was important for us to have a memorable silhouette and looks that were eye-catching even at a glance so we couldn t even have the same bangs as any other member when i wanted to get bangs for myself i had to get permission from our manager and it took time for my request to go through well i just hope that hairstyle helped even one person memorize who i was — compared to the other three in 5th generation i felt like you especially had rather memorable looks niigaki to be honest i hated having that hairstyle when i was already 15 or 16 years old when i finally got permission i cut my hair down almost to my shoulders and i got bangs there s a lyric in the song joshi kashimashi monogatari about how i was now happy to have bangs even tsunku♂ must have noticed laughs but really getting to finally cut my hair was such a relief — things like that would never escape tsunku♂ niigaki he really was like a father to us he would always worry about our health whenever we met him he would always ask us how are you doing if there s anything bothering you you can tell me any time he would tell us that even from the very beginning at our auditions but although he would usually never get angry at us about anything there was one exception he was very strict when it came to rhythm and singing in key — tsunku♂ is all about that 16th note rhythm 16-beat isn t he niigaki he would be constantly telling us don t just sing it all flat like that you have to put the 16-beat in there i was always immersing myself in the 16-beat in the beginning i would be singing while keeping the beat with my hands to remain mindful of the rhythm i must ve done that thousands of times with dancing too we would always start by learning the rhythm of the song we d do things like walk down the hallway to the beat of the song trying to soak our bodies in the rhythm it was so difficult at first and i didn t really even understand why we were doing it but before i d noticed it it had been drilled into me and once it had it actually made performing fun for me — what was an especially difficult choreography for you niigaki sexy boy ~soyokaze ni

your browser — that s so unexpected niigaki the side step may look simple on first glance but none of us could do it at first tsunku♂ had a very tsunku♂-like way of wanting us to feel the rhythm in that song it wasn t the usual one-two-three-four but like one-two one-two tsunku♂ came in during those dance rehearsals and we all formed one long row with him in the middle and we spent three hours learning just that one step together around those days tsunku♂ would always help us learn everything no matter how busy he was — that sounds like a valuable experience as well as an all-around great memory niigaki still in the 10 years i spent in the group it wasn t that often that we received hands-on training by tsunku♂ like that but that just goes to show how particular he was about the dance in that song thanks to his special training we did learn how to do it properly even now it s a tradition that when new members join the group the older members will teach them how to do that step — one day out of nowhere people started praising the group and calling it the platinum era how was that for you niigaki i joined morning musume when the group was in this period of widespread popularity and i wanted to be able to show the brilliance of that world to my juniors too but this was a time when things weren t going so great for the group the thing was though that even though we weren t appearing in the media very much we would still be performing overseas and everything about our concerts was in good order so i personally felt fulfilled at the time me and ai-chan would always be talking about how this was a time when we just needed to focus on doing what we did best and not letting down anyone who came to see us making the people who came to our concerts enjoy themselves that was our number one objective and we were all constantly aiming to become better dancers and just improving our skills to the fullest extent — so this was actually a rather positive period in time for you niigaki yes this might be surprising to people but that time period was just so much fun the songs we were releasing were all so great and since the average age of our members was relatively high we could have mature conversations together when there are kids in the group you always have to tell them to properly greet others or stand straight in line or whatever things that have nothing to do with performance and technique but this was a time when there was none of that and there was no discord between the members it was just a very stable environment there was a strong sense of unity between us and we all felt very ambitious about our activities — you were very assertive as a subleader you would be giving advice to your juniors even more than your leader ai-chan you seemed very eager to lead niigaki that s true that s something me and ai-chan would bump heads over i was the type who would always point out faults when i saw them whereas ai-chan was such a kind person that she couldn t easily approach others about things like that but i felt that there were times when the leader had to get angry and tell it like it is and that s something we would talk about time and time again we were both thinking about our juniors equally as much it was just that we had different ways of showing it — funnily enough apparently takahashi is now able to point out her juniors faults to them niigaki right it must be so annoying for them to have to take that laughs she could ve told them while she was still in the group and to think that we d get into these fights about it gaki-san tell them you tell them laughs as for me i stopped telling people off like that after i graduated so it really is like we both became the opposite of how we used to be — i hear that the things you most fought about had to do with junjun and linlin niigaki it really was difficult with them in the beginning junjun couldn t speak japanese at all and although we had an interpreter we were still worried if all the nuances of what we were trying to say to her were being conveyed linlin could speak the language but not the honorific language she would be speaking all casually even with the higher-ups so we d have to teach her the very basics also they d decide to take breaks at times when we were still in the midst of rehearsal we really had to start at zero with them telling them how they were never going to catch up to us at that pace — you had to work that out all by yourselves niigaki back when we joined the group our manager at the time happened to be the instructive type but as we became the seniors it changed into the members having to teach everything to each other but since we also had our own selves to worry about time management would be a big problem junjun and linlin had left the country they had been born and raised in and even though i m sure even just living here must have been difficult for them their work had to have been even more so they had to work many many times harder than the rest of us but little by little the two came to understand the group and ultimately they came to love being in morning musume they both got over this big obstacle and it was something that wasn t just about the language barrier either — i suppose the lesson here is take on your problems head-on and eventually it will bear results niigaki as you perform live you re singing and shedding sweat on the same stage it gives you this feeling of togetherness it was quite literally music transcending national borders i m sure it was difficult for them even just to be singing in japanese but our bonds had become strong to the point that they could overcome even something like that had our activities at the time been focused mainly on tv appearances we may not have developed bonds like that you only get one one shot on tv so you need that sort of instantaneous power but instead we kept steadily performing concerts and spending time every day just disciplining ourselves i think it worked out great in the end — that was an important period in morning musume s 20-year history niigaki the early days of the group were just dazzling but as time went on we got appear in the media less and less still we were carrying the weight of this big reputation on our shoulders and the members all felt that we wanted to carry it with pride through our activities and now the current members of the group have accepted that idea and adopted it for themselves to me that makes it feel like we re being rewarded for all the hard work we put in for the group that is why i now feel so grateful towards the current members the 9th generation a breath of fresh air — you were the final 5th generation member to graduate you stayed with the group up until the 10th generation s joining of the group niigaki when the 9th and 10th generation members joined the group it was this feeling of this this is it the members had been older up until then so the mood in the dressing room would always be relaxed but when the 9th generation joined it immediately became noisy again like one time we had these inflated balloons at the photo shoot and the new members would start playing around with them so i d have to raise my voice and go no stop running around but it was actually fun it immediately brightened up the atmosphere within the group me and ai-chan too would be talking about how that was what morning musume was all about we felt very thankful to the new members for having joined the group — so rather than thinking of it as a sign of trouble you actually welcomed them with open arms niigaki it was exactly like with junjun and linlin we had to teach them everything from the very basics like how to greet people properly and stuff and we had to go back to the basics again in our dance lessons too that was all fun the songs became totally different too something like maji desu ka ska suddenly we were singing songs where we we d be doing like line dancing together to think that just a short while earlier we had been this super cool group and now it was this i really liked that huge difference and i was able to accept and enjoy it right away it truly was a breath of fresh air being blown into the group the new members causing such a complete change in our music and just the atmosphere in general it was to the point where i had a hard time believing it was actually the same group that change felt so fresh to me — and then there was ikuta erina who would always be fearlessly approaching you niigaki that surprised me never before had i been told quite to that extent by any of my juniors that they loved me laughs personally i also loved abe natsumi for example but we were members of the same group and she was my senior so that made me exercise some self-control and the biggest thing was just that aura she had it made it impossible for me to get too close but none of that mattered to ikuta she d come up to me and be all niigaki-saaaaan ♡ i was going like what is this girl so that was something new as well ikuta even took part in the bus tour commemorating my graduation she got on the same bus as all the fans took a picture with me she did the same things as all the other fans then during the event she got so emotional she started crying and she was just weeping when i was waving her and the fans goodbye it was like what s wrong with you we re going to see each other tomorrow we ll be standing on stage together in no time laughs being able to be assertive like that towards one s seniors it kind of feels like the sign of a new era i m actually a little envious of her — how do you feel about the current members of the group niigaki i think they re so cool whenever i go see them in concert i notice their formation dancing getting more and more technical i have the same reaction as all the fans whaaat i can t believe my eyes laughs still as the group has a 20-year history behind it i m sure there are people who will compare the current lineup to their seniors that s something that we too would always be struggling with — how does one deal with thoughts like that niigaki you just believe in yourself and you keep going sure the past is important as well but the best thing they can do is have confidence in themselves it s not like we re going to say anything bad about them even if they do we ll all just think wow that s great they re really working hard — that s what the platinum era members did and they ended up getting the recognition they deserved niigaki you can have a past reputation and still do your best in the now sometimes you don t produce results right away it might take time until you get acknowledged but it will still be an important part of the group s history so i hope that they don t feel shy about the group but that they all believe in themselves as they do their best — it feels like the key point in the group having managed to go on for 20 years is the members ability to take their suffering and their conflicts think about what it is that they are supposed to be doing and convert those feelings into confidence and pride niigaki i definitely feel that way and it s also in the power of our songs it s girls of all ages and various personalities brought together by the appeal of the songs and the group itself and they re continuing to make history i think the group is where it is today because for 20 years its members have continued to believe in themselves and be proud of what they are doing i believe the fans who have continued to support the group do so because they too can sympathize with that certain morning musume spirit they can sense in the group the fans have proper manners and they always give the group such warm support they really do feel like our family — it feels like all its members tend to realize only once they ve left how large and grand of an existence the group actually is niigaki i got into morning musume because i truly loved them i want to try and be someone who can continue to help the group in any way i can turning adversity into opportunity — has your morning musume past ever been a hindrance in your current field of work niigaki when i walk on to the set as an actress i ve had people think you re just an idol what can you do for 10 years i seriously worked for my dear life and it s something i m proud to have done so people brushing it off with a simple you re just an idol is really really frustrating just because of the word idol they put you in this category that says you know nothing about anything that you re completely hopeless at everything i d always be screaming at those people in my head morning musume isn t like that — but on the flip side you ve also had people reconsider their opinion of you once they ve gotten to see you at work right niigaki yes surprisingly as i keep at it i ve had many people acknowledge me or no i shouldn t say surprisingly as i said morning musume aren t just some good-for-nothings laughs anyway even if someone does think that way of me it s morning musume that gave me the guts to be able to withstand adversity like that even the fact that i m now able to get on stage all by myself is all thanks to the mental strength that i gained from having spent those 10 years as a member of morning musume — could you have been a member of any other group niigaki morning musume was an environment where i had all these amazing seniors as well as juniors so i was able to see myself from all kinds of different angles i learned so much there i can t imagine having been a member of any other group — lastly what is morning musume to you niigaki morning musume is my asset it s the place where i spent almost the entirety of my teen years all that pain and happiness and all the other emotions i experienced were created by morning musume and had i not lived through those things i m sure i wouldn t be who i am today now i get to do my current work and sometimes i ll meet with the other members and we ll share our memories i m pretty sure if it wasn t for morning musume my life would have been entirely without meaning — starting from a point of adversity like you did i can see how you might especially feel that way niigaki i was so shy and quiet when i was little but i found something i wanted to do and in those 10 years i became stronger in so many ways it enabled me to grow up mentally too doing something for 10 years straight is no easy task but there are certain things you can only discover if you don t quit midway and you decide to see something through to the end morning musume is what taught me that and that s why i love them my song nanchatte renai niigaki a lot of the songs from this period were mature love songs and i adore them all this song especially is so chic with its worldview our monotone outfits and adult-like makeup and all we often sang this song when we went overseas too gaki-san reading all of that made my heart swell with joy remember what is it about morning musume and hello project that brought me to them niigaki risa always had my respect and now i respect her and everyone else involved behind the scenes even more this was a truly great read and thanks for the translation keep up the good work henkka really good interview gaki-san went through a lot in the group and it made her a stronger person seeing how she overcame her more recent problems thanks for the translation can t wait for people to get over this soon to be cat lady i ve always really liked niigaki i find her twin tails really cute d these types of interviews are really fun to read and also very informative thank you for translating this she summed up exactly what i love about the platinum era so perfectly platinum era-loss i just realized a weird coincidence gaki s ex-husband was one of the ultraman s and the hair style they made gaki-chan wear was mother of ultra hair asami s eyes and tiny voice made me think she s negative haha mind you i like konkon young risa s former hairstyle was goofy but i like her bangs and eyebrows like many others i hope there s a video how junjun and linlin decide to take breaks in the midst of rehearsal but i doubt it because the office probably wouldn t like it haha eripon is my oshi so i loved that part as usual i definitely agree with the fans can sympathize with that certain morning musume spirit their music conveys it and they are proud overall what a kind woman and i love her husky voice risa is a true morning musume it was only when i got to show myself graduate after having spent 10 years in the group and everyone was cheering for me that i attained this peace of mind i ve finally been accepted as part of morning musume. that part really give me the shivers sooo tragic and romantic that words breaks my heart for good and bad such a good read gaki s words really make me appreciate morning musume and how many of its members still love and appreciate the group your email address will not be published comment name email website
