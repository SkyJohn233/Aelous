posting a lowly comment anyway if someone is really low and crooked then i guess they ca n't be stopped congratulations yoon eun hye for winning 2nd place indeed you 're a designer avidfan nov 13 2015 10:44 am i 'd love to see you together w/ hyun bin plssssss consider a movie w/ him pls directorssss and writersssss plsssssssssssssssssssssssss make it haapppennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn binhye couple in an action good movie or drama huhuhu ..i super ship them together tel nov 13 2015 9:23 am reposting my comment it 's my way of supporting my forever idol yoon eun hye i 'm glad the muse dress 2 is over and she 's the 2nd placer in regard to the mob mentality about her plagiarizing pls watch the episodes so that you 'll understand how she came up w/ each design.yoon eun hye has talent in designing ever since she 's a high-school-er if you research on her background and the s0-called plagiarized designs are not exactly the same for it to be really plagiarized.i myself love fashion and i 've encountered a lot of design which are very similar but had n't been reported to be plagiarized because they were n't worn on a tv show featuring designs who knows there might have been but designers did n't give shits on it as they know the essence of fashion she also clearly explained why how they came up w/ he design and did not just copy them here 's a designer 's idea about fashion fashion is the emergence of fashion trends trends exist because fashion can t be copyrighted fashion design is utilitarian and anything considered utilitarian like cars clothing and food can t be copyrighted ex canned goods a lot are alike but they 're made of diff ingredients varied rolled rice almost the same but w/ diff taste and ingredients etc..this is the same as dresses designed by designers the logic is this everyday things are important in the society that if someone were to hold power over them we d likely all be walking around naked eating raw and getting around on horseback many vehicles are alike fashion is an everyday need and that makes it a creative free-for-all if you love fashion then be open minded and understand how it works as well and jeeeez yoon eun hye has brains she 's not someone who will put herself and the show in a difficult situation especially that she joined the show only bec it 's her interest designing not for money hoping this simple explanation cleared those questioning thoughts about what happened in muse dress 2 yoon eun hye partner painstakingly think and correlate each designs they made according to the theme of the episode they did not just get the coat and thought of hmm.. we 'll copy this but let 's redesign and restyle the ruffles.anyways enough of this i 'm so glad that it 's over and she 's in the 2nd place.let 's spread love and support to all k stars after all we all love their dramas.fighting yoon eun hye you 're one of the greatest so heads up but keep your feet on the ground xoxo fans nov 08 2015 5:43 am i knew korean drama first because of her yeh her acting is so excellent i do n't know what the real is happened i have read a lot of articles i think the vice president also must looking for the proof not only heard by one side the designer or the another the designer was wrong also because his announcement on media sosial without confirmation to the actress or agency with hard effort i know yeh has so many talent she is able to draw design also if yeh was wrong why the designer did n't bring it to the law fans nov 02 2015 7:17 am i like your all drama you r so talented k-star nov 02 2015 6:15 am i was mesmarized by your performance in coffee prince you are the best of all 3 3 saranghae unniee gee oct 25 2015 1:52 pm i would suggest to yoon eun hye to just ignore haters comments and remind yourself that you are probably 100 times happier and more successful with more money than people who waste their time tearing others down online haters are indication that you ve made it to an extent you are a bright smart talented gifted and beautiful person do n't let other people tear you down you are dearly loved and respected all over the world.i am proud to be your fan may god bless yoon eun hye gee oct 25 2015 12:55 pm he who conceals hatred has lying lips and he who spreads slander is a fool proverbs 10:18 tel oct 24 2015 7:57 pm i love you unnie and support you no matter what we 've been yoon eun hye deprived on dramas already hoping to watch you soon w/ good write-ups and perfect leading man 'be waiting for after love .fighting you 're doing great and congratulations for winning another design on the show..you 're beautiful inside and out that 's why you 're at what you are right now i 've come to know k dramas because of you in princess hours thanks to you take care and god bless more you endeavors fighting tel oct 24 2015 7:45 pm to the haters.. watch the reports/episode and compare the so-called plagiarized white coat w/c i also did before you comment here.yoon eun hye have a talent in designing ever since she 's a high-schooler if you research on her background and the coats are not exactly the same for it to be copied/plagiarized.i myself love fashion and i 've encountered a lot of design which are very similar but had n't been reported to be plagiarized because they were n't worn on a well known tv show featuring designs or who knows there could have been but designers did n't give shits on it as they know the essence of fashion.she also already explained how she came up w/ the design and did not just copy the white coat and to clarify or help those who does n't really know about fashion to enlighten you guys fashion is the emergence of fashion trends trends exist because fashion can t be copyrighted fashion design is utilitarian and anything considered utilitarian like cars clothing and food can t be copyrighted ex century tuna and corned beef appearance are almost the same but thy 're not another ex different types of rolled rice prepared by different cook this is the same as dresses designed by designers the logic is these everyday things are important in the society that if someone were to hold power over them we d likely all be walking around naked eating raw and getting around on horseback.fashion is an everyday need and that makes it a creative free-for-all a plagiarists buffet if you will hoping this explanation cleared those questioning thoughts regarding the issue yoon eun hye did not plagiarize she clearly explained how she/they came up w/ the design they did not just get the 'white coat and thought of hmm.. we 'll do this but let 's redesign the shape and ruffles.okay if you love fashion then be open minded and understand how it works as well fighting unnie and let 's spread love and support to all k stars after

perhaps i just want to see you acting on screen i miss you so much we have been yeh deprived for soooo long i love you and i wish you all the best libra girl oct 13 2015 6:45 am the way she responded to her latest scandal is very rude do not use the name of yoon eun hye dear the accusation is not for him to use your name but to tell the world that you plagiarized his design the design that he spent effort time brain cells talent also even the head designer of princess hours has enough evidence that you plagiarized her designs too what a shame you should at least apologize not because you are famous you can make everyone bow to you probably one of the rudest actress in the history of korea please stay humble and do not let the success rise too much on your head if an ordinary person is accused of plagiarism maybe everyone is scrutinizing him/her but because you are famous and has many fans you have the guts to stay proud even though it is very obvious that you did wrong i used to like you what a shame miss singapore oct 03 2015 9:36 pm with all the evidences against her even the head designer of princess hours accused yoon eun hye of stealing her work sad how the designer of the white dress is the only one bullied ny yoon eun hye fans it seems yoon eun hye is really guilty of plagiarism as much as you guys want to say that it is ok to plagiarize in fashion just to defend yoon eun hye imagine how the designers whose designs stolen by yoon eun hye feel right now they put effort in designing dress and shoes only to be stolen by others and worse the design was praised but the credit is not to them i do n't have something against yoon eun hye but we must look at the other side of things i also experienced to my ideas stolen so i can relate to what those designers are feeling right now hry sep 29 2015 10:10 am i know and love eun hye in marry him if you dare i was impressed by your character na mirae i love the storyline it´s so different from other kdramas keep working well eonnie reverdrama sep 26 2015 3:47 pm she is loved cause she is so natural cute she has the face that we have to love she is attrative face cause she is not the perfection that why she a value sure .i love her in marry him if you dare i felt the lead actor and she make something like passionate love cause the storyline is very good director are good and it seems that love is reincarnated endless love i hope that we can see her again and again yehchaego sep 18 2015 6:51 am i do n't know if you 'll ever read this but i just want to say that i have been your fan ever since goong and regardless of whatever is going on right now with your life i will still continue to support you fighting do n't let the haters win and i know i 'm not the only one who will say this we love you grace2yoon sep 13 2015 7:41 pm in her fascinating ted talk johanna blakley points out that the side effect of plagiarism in fashion is the emergence of fashion trends trends exist because fashion can t be copyrighted fashion design is utilitarian and anything considered utilitarian like cars clothing and food can t be copyrighted the logic goes that these everyday things are so important in our society that if someone were to hold power over them we d likely all be walking around naked eating raw and getting around on horseback fashion is so fundamental to our daily lives and that also makes it a creative free-for-all a plagiarists buffet if you will grace2yoon sep 13 2015 7:39 pm coco chanel once said that copying is the ransom of success. and we hate to be the one s to remind you but fashion is all about copying there is no such thing as an original style those things called trends basically mean we re all going to be dressing the same forever and even fashion photographers seem to run out of original ideas sora sep 12 2015 6:42 am did you hear about her copying other designer 's works and claiming them as her own what hilarious story at least admit that they were references or for inspiration rather than copying off the whole thing taking someone else 's work and claiming that they are yours are none other than stealing or robbery hope she learns her lesson

2015 5:11 pm yoon eun hye is a great and excellent actress all she needs is a good script and an awesome chemistry between the two leads i loved her chemistry with all her leading men in all her dramas the chemistry was so natural believable and hot from what i saw she was very good in the kissing scenes with the other leading guys i also know what you mean about her crying i can t get through any of her crying scenes without crying with her she has this ability to just suck you in and when she cries i cry along with her niru jan 08 2015 4:22 am i really like her she 's awesome i first saw her in coffee prince and i 'm in love with the movie she and gong yoo are perfect together yehfan jan 06 2015 7:48 pm when it comes to guests on running man there has never been a person more requested for than yoon eun-hye if you watched enough running man you would have realized that the name yoon eun-hye appears more often than most of the guests who 've already been on the show the running man members themselves especially yoo jae-suk occasionally drops eun-hye 's name during episodes and the re-enactment of the classic of course game is almost always referenced.if you do n't know why eun-hye is the most requested for guest you 'll have to go back to the days of sbs 's x-man when she and kim jong-kook were the variety world 's power couple they were like the monday couple of x-man the situation has escalated to a point that should eun-hye appear in a future episode the running man ratings for that week will undoubtedly go through the roof.but ratings aside here are 4 more reasons why yoon eun-hye should appear on running man yehfan jan 04 2015 11:14 am yoon eun hye s go ah jung in lie to me is so relatable – she s that hard working girl next door who doesn t seem to have the time or care to get married and who s secure enough of herself that she knows exactly who she is she will not get jerked around by some chaebol – she sees him as a person rather than a status since she holds on to her morals i enjoyed her spunk in paying back kang ji hwan s hyun ki joon and then going on to prank the other guests because the opportunity was there and it would be oh-so-hilarious i loved her in the bathroom scene when she rushes to pee in the suite she s a natural at these kinds of roles – the spunky girl not rich spoiled girl dscorpion dec 13 2014 9:08 am yeh down-to-earth beautiful heart of gold multi-talented you 're simply admirable wishing you for more success and good health always lou dec 12 2014 2:00 pm please make another kdrama for gong yoo and

time korean actress keep your head up high choose the right god 's blessings to you for all that you do you are a special lady **** unique**** jen nov 06 2014 5:51 am hope you accept the role together with park shi hoo.. after love vania oct 24 2014 9:46 pm yoon eun hye forever with u fighting mark oct 15 2014 3:34 pm i 'd been watching lots of korean movies but my first kdrama series was lie to me i just completely fell in love with yeh as much as i 've watched many many many other kdramas since i have yet to find anyone close to how much i just adore her i think the reason is the more i know about her the more i 'm just in total admiration she 's beautiful extremely down-to-earth heart of gold multi-talented act sing artist travel to very poor areas giving her time and money to those in need etc so yeah i watch other kdramas but i 'm always looking forward to seeing yeh in her next project by far my favorite actress amy oct 12 2014 7:16 am 11 k-drama gender-benders ranked by realness gender bending is an incredibly popular k-drama some of these dramas are more convincing than others in terms of how believable the act is here are our rankings of who sold their boyish features best:1 coffee princebelievability score 20/20yoon eun hye is the clear winner when it comes to selling her androgyny she captures both the looks and mannerisms of a boy and she sells her performance sandii oct 09 2014 7:51 pm i think that yoon eun hye 's versatile look and down to earth personality helps with creating amazing chemistry with her male co-star what i appreciate from her is that she tends to re-create herself emotionally and physically with each project that she does i do n't see any other k-actress who looks different in each project/drama/modelling as she does with a simple change in the hair department and i think it contributes to matching with her male co-star. -you 're right about yeh always having chemistry with all of her co-stars i think that 's one of her appeal that makes people keep watching her dramas no matter how high or low the rating is no matter how ridiculous the plot is she always invest herself into the character she portray in coffee prince she cut her hair learn the way of man 's talk walk in vineyard man she tanned her skin in my fair lady she colored her hair and in lie to me she was n't afraid to cut her hair when the drama progressed to immersed herself into her character and i believe she wo n't be afraid to portray a retarded or a killer character if it 's needed i think yeh good qualities beside her talent is that she does n't hold back she does n't think of her image when it 's come to acting that 's make her a good actress in my book kim oct 08 2014 8:20 pm k-dramas are always toying with our emotions in one episode we might go from rolling on the floor laughing to sobbing uncontrollably but for the k-drama actors creating these scenes mastering the tears is n't always so easy some actors are too stoic only showing a single tear that kind of looks like someone put eye drops in two minutes before filming at the other end of the spectrum are those who go too far wailing like a sack full of dying cats even the most talented k-drama actors struggle with emotional scenes from time to time but there are some who just happen to be natural criers here are 12 of the most convincing k-drama criers—the ones who can pull tears from us every time much like her kissing eun hye wrote the book on k-drama crying in every drama every time she makes it feel real oh ha na oct 01 2014 3:39 pm happy anniversary let god make you more and more beautiful movie for us yours fan mitch g. oct 01 2014 2:46 pm very beautiful good actress myba sep 30 2014 4:53 pm yeh is a woman with so much talent just has not had the opportunity to explore it in all ranges even she has a lot to explore she is unlimitedly full of talent that i do not doubt for a moment in their abilities to perform any type of paper and that special thing she has done really unique in its field so i 'll be patient for your next project yehfan sep 30 2014 4:13 pm comment from a yeh fan what i 've gathered from the past eight years of watching korean dramas is that while the players both male and female are nearly always extraordinarily talented and fun to watch the time constraints and week to week writing and shooting schedules are often the source of weakness in the scripts and character development as time is measured and ever moving while deadlines are constantly to be met it is the writers and directors who are ultimately responsible for how a drama moves and comes out in the end even for an obvious talent like yoon eun hye not knowing the behind the scenes realities can often confuse the viewer we like her we will continue to like her and the more that one learns about her background and personality the more smitten with her one is likely to become we root for her and we have sometimes felt let down by various works that have seen her qualities and abilities under and misused all actors and actresses have suffered the slings and arrows of poor production and vacuous script writing this is not a new thing the one control as far as a performer 's input goes is their own effort and ability and not once can any informed viewer say that this area has been in any way lacking on any project throughout the career of yoon eun hye the production may fail her but she will never fail the production not to worry though as she will get plenty more chances because she will be around for a long long time suzy sep 27 2014 8:38 am yoon eun hye is without a doubt my favorite korean actress she was the main star of the korean drama i ever saw and she was so impressive that i was compelled to watch all of the dramas starring her up to now i am still have not been disappointed with all her work she has played everything from a gawky princess to a tomboy and in every role she played them perfectly and so realistically i can recommend every single one of her dramas ganee sep 24 2014 5:43 pm when journalists asked yoo seung ho about who s the actress that he most enjoyed working together he replied that yoon eun hye-noona is very easy going person he really enjoys working with her the most mj sep 24 2014 10:42 am you are one of the very few actresses who has made a huge impact on me .i 've been watching korean dramas more than 140 for a while now and the roles you played on coffee prince princess hours vineyard man keeps coming back to my mind quite often.your screen presence is amazing and thank you for those wonderful characters a fan from india jen nguyen sep 14 2014 9:45 pm i feel sorry for the one who is jealous with yoon eun hye you know the more you are be angrier and hater you will be sad and not have a happy life just think about life is too short so we need to forget all issues forgive mistake of others and enjoy this life hope you can understand more about the value of life jen ng sep 14 2014 9:40 pm i feel sorry for the one who is jealous with yoon eun hye you know what the more you are be the hater and angrier you will be sad and not have the happy life just think about the life is too short so we

castro aug 30 2014 2:53 am there 's many reason why i really like yoon eun hye and maybe one of the reason is she have a good heart and that 's really important i loveeeeeee youuuuuuuuu and i promise i 'll be your 1 fan no natter what happen yeah aug 21 2014 4:46 pm comments from a yeh fan goong 2006 shin chae gyung main role playful childish princessit was funny and made me lol numerous times it also had me getting angry at the characters and falling in love with them that s how i know it was awesome yoon eun hye was beautiful as always but shin chae gyung childish acting sometimes got to my nerves though the drama is your typical modern day cinderella story yoon eun hye s acting and portrayal of a pure innocent teenage high school student which she got her life upside down by the arranged marriage with the crowned prince made the whole show a pleasure to watch the ost the clothes the scenery was all like a new world for me.the vineyard man 2006 lee ji hyeon main role striving sweet city girlji-hyun an extraordinary girl who will show the world her great achievements someday left home to work in a small village it 's surprisingly entertaining because it creates a fun environment from start to finish the high dose of humour helps a lot as does the strong chemistry between the actors the characters are nicely developed fun stuff that 's worth seeking out eun hye is extremely gorgeous she s both believable and admirable in her role and loved her marvelous acting about how she learns to releases her inner beauty and her arrogance added humour in the drama in a sweet warm way.the 1st shop of coffee prince 2007 go eun chan main role tomboyish but adorablecoffee prince is one of those drama you can t do other than loving and re=watching all the time my chan a 24-year-old tomboy is the head of her household when her family was entangled into more debts she seeks employment at coffee prince which only hires handsome guys and disguises herself as a boy to get the job eun chan is very mature and logical and tries to keep an optimistic personality she s very lovable character making her almost impossible for people to hate she bonds with her male co-workers in my opinion no girl has been able to act as a guy better than eun-hye she didn t only cut her hair but also adapted the mannerisms of a male she did such good job that sometimes i forgot that she was actually female moreover her chemistry with gong yoo was indescribable they portrayed a love between a man and a woman so realistically the writers actors did a wonderful job with their characters and their acting was superb.take care of the young lady 2009 kang hye na main role spoiled bratty but good heartedhye na is a horrible spoiled brat but has a definite innocent child-like aura to her that makes it forgiving life is easy for her and she gets what she wants although she was at first self-centered she matured throughout the whole drama not just at the end so that s the best thing that happened is the character development yoon eun hye as usual impressed me with her magnificent acting she really can pull off any role and i really loved how the main leads truly fell in love and their relationship.lie to me 2011 gong ah jung main role workaholic and strong-willed eun hyeah jung gets entangled in a web of lies when she mistakenly lies that she s married to hyun ki joon a hotel manager ah jung considers herself a servant of the people she has plenty of energy and has a tomboyish charm eun hye makes for a very convincing every day woman you have to appreciate that kind of freedom you just can t help kind of relate to her kang ji hwan and yoon looked fabulous together with a lot of humour potential in the pairing their combination does n't just look like it should work but explode with fireworks they had amazing senses and for me the coca cola kissing scene was the best.missing you 2012 lee soo yeon main role feared but still cheerful romantic eun hyeseeing yeh previous drama we see that most her drama are on the rom-com side but this one is a melodrama so prepare your tissues it was beyond words i was amazed stunned by her great acting and impersonates her character as if she was real she proved that she 's a talented actress that can pull off such a complex sad agonist character like su yeon i praise her for that it was n't all tragedy though she had great chemistry between both yoo seung ho and park yoochun they had intense passionate kisses and good chemistry together that progressively developed throughout the drama and made their characters much more rich as well as their interactions she seriously never disappointed me i hope she keeps improving like that in the future her acting was flawless she strongly portrayed her role and it was worth the tears.marry him if you dare 2013 na mi rae main role – ordinary lady wants to reach her dreammi rae is a bright and lovable 32-year-old with a frizzly crimped hair who spends her days scraping her job but one day her future self appears in front of her to persuade her to believe in herself and reach for her dream it s really entertaining i really love eun hye s acting she just always surprises me in her superb acting and her attraction for kim shin feels so real mimiya aug 17 2014 9:37 am yehfan i agree w/ u on these reasons to love her 3 she is ****convincing as a boy**** .. 5 she 's a ****good kisser**** .. 6 good chemistry w/ her male leads .. 7 her ****classy style**** .. 9 she is a natural .. 10 we want to befriend her characters quirky awkwardly endearing i disagree about 2 imo it is the opposite not much natural beauty .. she is photogenic and needs the makeup to make her look stunning as a model but she is pretty cute and has a nice body to sum it all up she has ***** charm charisma and talent ***** and i love her quirky awkwardly endearing ways yehfan aug 14 2014 5:28 pm here are 10 reasons yoon eun hye has won our love in every drama she 's ever done.1 she can rock a bad haircut…many korean dramas feature awkward female characters in serious need of a makeover but no one goes all out quite like yoon eun hye this woman seems to have no boundaries when it comes to painful styling choices and we love her for it remember the bowl cut from coffee prince 2 she s stunningly beautiful…if you only knew yoon eun hye from her acting you might assume that she wasn t much to look at take a look at her modeling though and suddenly you realize how much effort it must have taken to make her look frumpy she has a natural beauty that shines through in her photo shoots what i like the most about her is that she has had little or no plastic surgery her teeth she leaves a bit crooked her nose is her nose maybe a little lip plumping but she is captivating.3 but can also make us believe she is a boy…there are a lot of cross-dressing dramas out there and 99.99999 of the time it s absurd to believe that anyone would mistake these women for men a bowl cut isn t a replacement for an adam s apple and it s a testament to yoon eun hye s versatility as an actress that she was able to pull of go eun chan so convincingly i love yoon eun hye i 've seen every one of her shows on dramafever and even some movies that are n't on the website she is an amazing actress and so inspiring one of the few actresses that i simply ca n't wait to show up on the screen i 'm excited to watch her new drama i know she will do soo well yeh fighting 4 she is a good person in real life…yoon eun hye has been consistent in her charity work sometimes it can be easy to assume that celebs only give as a publicity stunt but yoon eun hye has a pretty consistent track record that proves otherwise she has been working with orphanages since her teenage years who doesn t want to support talent like that my favourite yoon eun hye character is yoon eun hye as seen in road of hope a truly beautiful person who also happens to be a gifted actress especially in romantic comedies and a great fashion model when i look at yoon eun hye i just feel really good you could totally feel that she 's a good person who you wan na root for she treats everyone well from her staff to the people who works behind the scenes and they have attested to her good nature.5.she knows how to kiss…thank you yoon eun hye many kdrama leading ladies hold perfectly still and let the men do all of the work but that has never been yoon eun hye s style she understands that kissing is a passionate two-way street one of the major reasons i love yoon eun hye is for her kissing ability she 's one of the very few korean actresses i 've seen that could make a kiss look passionate.6.she creates chemistry with her male leads…this goes beyond just kissing she builds strong chemistry through all of her interactions with male leads whether it s arguing or laughing or bantering this consistent spark makes her eventual kissing scenes even more believable.7.her classy style…sometimes celebrity styling can go overboard but yoon eun hye is consistently edgy and sophisticated i want to become her best friend and then raid her closet yoon eun hye has the it factor she has that natural charm and confidence that translate well onscreen there are so many other actresses who are far prettier but yeh possesses that it factor that far outshines pretty .8.her crying face…her crying face gives me a crying face i just can t resist those sobs and it 's true i get teary whenever she cries on screen she 's that good also ca n't help but smile when she laughs and get tingly when she kisses fill-in-the-blank hot actor costar.9.she is a natural …whether she is acting or modeling there is a sense of ease about yoon eun hye that is disarming have n't watched a yoon eun hye drama i have n't liked she 's an amazing actress i liked all her dramas very much she 's such a lovely and expressive actress.10.we want to befriend her characters…yoon eun hye is known for her quirky awkwardly endearing characters we would love to hang out with these people in real life just the best she can literally give justice to the role she portrays whatever is thrown on her for me she can go to a corner act a role that can make the audience laugh then move to another part of the stage and make the audience cry she is that awesome love her to the end.wow those are my reasons too those are just

happy that yeh will be in the movie chronicles of a blood merchant although she is not the main female lead i think her role as ha jung woo 's character 's first love seems interesting this will be a good experience/opportunity for her to work with good movie veterans and learn more about her craft they also say that yeh is doing the movie for free as a friend to actor/director ha jung woo yeh really is a kind and generous friend i also like that in the group picture of the entire cast/crew for the movie yeh sat at the corner instead of beside ha jung woo and ha ji won although yeh is also an a-lister like the 2 hjw 's yeh knows her place and so gives the center stage to the main leads of the movie such is her humility gracie may 25 2014 8:21 am any korean drama without yoon eun hye

understanding and appreciation for yoon eun hye just when i thought i couldn t love this young lady any more than i already do she just gave me more reasons to love her even more her inner self glows with that imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit a caring heart that seeks the good of others above her own she is a big star but her greatness is built deep on a foundation of humility and meekness that is evident not only in her words but more so in her actions she is so selfless making no effort to glorify herself with her own words but generously gives praise to others many women

most-watched asian celebrities of her generation yeh finds herself thrown into the arena of public scrutiny every time she makes an appearance but while critics have been generally kind not everyone sees her with the same set of approving eyes all too often people judge celebrities based on their appearance how nicely they are dressed if the hairstyle goes with the dress what or who they are wearing and if they look good in pictures even us ordinary mortals fall into the trap of measuring ourselves against those standards but isn t this all just external beyond the flawless makeup expensive clothes hairstyle fancy nails designer shoes jewelry and accessories there is a kind of beauty that can not be bought by money manufactured or re-engineered by science contrary to popular notion looking good actually begins from the inside not from the outside outward beauty may appeal to the eyes for a time but it s what s inside that attracts and connects to people s emotional intellectual physical and spiritual levels in my life i have seen quite a few women who have that kind of imperishable beauty among celebrities yeh is definitely in my books and it s easy to see why yeh s beauty glows from within and unless people take time to look beyond skin deep they will miss the true vision of a beauty that s unfading the kind of beauty that the latest technology fashion cosmetics precious stones or medical surgery ca n't produce yeh s inner beauty emanates from an attitude of humility kindness and quietness of spirit it flows from a heart that understands and gratefully accepts who god made her to be and stays true to her calling because of these inner qualities no matter which way critics thumbs may go in my eyes yeh will always be one who walks in true beauty. yehfan may 10 2014 3:37 pm some fan comments on yeh yeh walks in beauty but not everyone sees it nor appreciates it as one of the most-watched asian celebrities of her generation yeh finds

depicts who yoon eun hye really is to all her fans who respect and admire her from all over the world after watching her dramas/movies on tv and online i just want to share it here each and every yeh s drama has been very significant be it commercially successful or not because in her every drama she was able to show to people her personal traits which are truly commendable and worth emulating 1 goong – her strong willed and determination – though her capabilities as an actress has been questioned even before the drama start airing wherein petition for her to be removed as the main character has been made it never stop her in taking the role for she believes that turning down the role will only prove her detractors wrong since she never gave up and determined to succeed everything now is history chae-kyeong is undeniably has become one of the most loveable and known character in the k-drama history 2 vineyard man – her hardwork and professionalism – i have been reading over and over again how the pd of this drama has praised her during the filming even in scorching heat under the sun she never heard her complain which i think is so rare for an actress like her even her senior co-stars predicted that she will go a long way in the industry because of her work ethics and warm personality and their prediction turns out to be right 3 coffee prince – her passion – for me her believable portrayal of go eun chan cemented her status as an a-list actress wherein praises for her acting is beyond words she has since begun became the point of reference for every cross-dressing character too bad yeh has set the bar too high wherein i have never seen any actress who had acted as a cross-dresser any way closer to yeh as go eun chan 4 my fair lady – her humility – criticism about her pronunciations/enunciations has become the hot topic during the airing of this drama and she too acknowledge it the mere fact that an a-list actress like her is so vocal about her limitations and shortcomings made me adore her more for she just proves that no matter how great she is as perceived by other she can never be perfect for having those limitations and shortcomings because she is just a human like us after all 5 lie to me – her loyalty – her detractors may say that flop may be the first word that they may remember whenever lie to me will be heard but for me loyalty will comes first in my mind whenever i will be reminded of this drama yeh s track record may have been tarnished because of this drama but the fact remain that yeh has decided to take the lead on this drama after two years of waiting because of the promise that she had made with the production s ceo who may face great financial loss due to an unforeseen incident related to now been shelves love song drama which is a rare gem in the entertainment industry although honestly i don t want this to repeat again in the future 6 missing you – her flexibility as an actress and generosity – her portrayal of lee seo yeon in a dark melodrama genre has silenced her detractors who believes that she can only pull-off rom-com dramas she may not been able to have an acting award for this however no acting controversies has been cast against her it is because she really aced it generosity would be an understatement to coin the term when she together with her male co-lead in the drama gave an all-expense overseas trip to all the drama s production staff and crew i think they are the first and only actress and actor who done it so far lastly in her world when everything is just make-believe she continually proves that humane entertainer like still do exist who will always be an exemption to the k-world rules grace may 10 2014 10:15 am i think yeh is my favorite actress is because when i see her on screen for anything where it be cf drama game shows etc my eyes follow i think this girl has something that makes me want to know her there 's no barrier between her and the audience melyn may 10 2014 8:35 am yeh congrats to your new cafe but please come back to the small screen we missed you grace us with a new drama soon.. rivanaraja may 10 2014 7:57 am yoon eun hye is always the best

feb 19 2012 5:48 am funny and down-to-earth portrayals of hard-working everyday people that 's what has attracted me to this tremendous actress what range in lie to me from comedy to bathos the sizzling chemistry in coffee prince sorry the illegible subtitles and high school setting stopped me from watching princess hours many blessings from puerto rico ebbyba feb 17 2012 11:03 am yoon eun hye just lov u so much ..hope for great life n career always fighting girl elmer feb 13 2012 7:45 am i 'm a guy ..yet i 'm sooo freakingly obssesed with a korean actress.. what will i do i even have dreams of her being my girlfriend i 'm doomed.. this all started when i watched her in my fair lady/ take care of agasshi..i guess her role in that drama amuses me..high tempered brat who would do anything impulsively..but because yoon eun hye was a certified cutie she was able to give a different light to kang hye na 's character after that as long as i 'm not busy i would find time to watch and follow her in everything drama -old and latest- interviews etc.. as long as she 's in it even in her character as a tomboy makes me want my girlfriend to be dynamic and charming as go eun chan i even laughed like crazy in her two dramas goong/ princess hours and the vineyard man i 've just watched it lately though right now i watching her lie to me ..i 'm not yet done but the guy there was sure lucky to have kissed my dream-girl plenty of times huh .. -.^ ..jealousy jealousy but well .the guy she would end up with.. in real life would be half lucky and half doomed for sure -lucky to win her heart.. yet doomed to carry out the burden of having a very popular girlfriend -chased by men.. good for you dude p .she really have the ability to make all the character she portray stands out and lives a mark she is the only korean actress that captures my deepest interest if only i 'll be given a chance to be with her..i would really steal a kiss from her gorgeous lips and stare like forever in her calm innocent expressive eyes.the more i see her in her dramas shows and interviews i realize that she really has a very adorable personality coz you can read it through the way she talks stare act smile or even her gestures or habits..all these sums up to one reason..yoon eun hye 's aura is very captivating .what will i do now ..it 's already too late for me to stop loving her sigh /3 but anyway happy valentines my dear yoon eun hye agasshi bebs feb 12 2012 3:01 am shes a natural fateme feb 11 2012 7:00 am i love yoon eun hye and every single drama that she played on i
