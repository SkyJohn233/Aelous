integrin α5 suppresses the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor and its cellular signaling of cell proliferation via n-glycosylation skip to main page content background the functions of integrin α5 on cell proliferation and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear results loss of n -glycosylation on α5 increased the phosphorylation and internalization of egfr and abolished its inhibitory effects on cell proliferation conclusion integrin α5 regulates egfr-mediated signaling through n -glycosylation significance n -glycosylation plays important roles in the cross-talk between integrins and growth factor receptors integrin α5β1-mediated cell adhesion regulates a multitude of cellular responses including cell proliferation survival and cross-talk between different cellular signaling pathways integrin α5β1 is known to convey permissive signals enabling anchorage-dependent receptor tyrosine kinase signaling however the effects of integrin α5β1 on cell proliferation are controversial and the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation between integrin α5β1 and receptor tyrosine kinase remain largely unclear here we show that integrin α5 functions as a negative regulator of epidermal growth factor receptor egfr signaling through its n -glycosylation expression of wt integrin α5 suppresses the egfr phosphorylation and internalization upon egf stimulation however expression of the n -glycosylation mutant integrin α5 s3–5 which contains fewer n -glycans reversed the suppression of the egfr-mediated signaling and cell proliferation in a mechanistic manner wt but not s3–5 integrin α5 forms a complex with egfr and glycolipids in the low density lipid rafts and the complex formation is disrupted upon egf stimulation suggesting that the n -glycosylation of integrin α5 suppresses the egfr activation through promotion of the integrin α5-glycolipids-egfr complex formation furthermore consistent restoration of those n -glycans on the calf-1,2 domain of integrin α5 reinstated the inhibitory effects as well as the complex formation with egfr taken together these data are the first to demonstrate that egfr activation can be regulated by the n -glycosylation of integrin α5 which is a novel molecular paradigm for the cross-talk between integrins and growth factor receptors epidermal growth factor receptor egfr 2 a member of the erbb receptor tyrosine kinase family converts extracellular cues into intracellular effectors to trigger appropriate cellular responses 1 – 3 which play a key role in normal epithelial developmental biology and in tumor metastasis 4 a dysregulation of egfr signaling including receptor overexpression and/or activation is a common feature in tumorigenesis 5 due to this aberrant activity in the pathology of cancer egfr has emerged as an attractive candidate for anticancer therapy 6 which prompted us to examine the underlying molecular mechanisms for egfr activation egfr activation forms a complex signaling network with several regulators including related cytoplasmic proteins micrornas tyrosine kinase inhibitors and other coupled receptors 7 – 9 however studies that address these direct or indirect regulations of egfr have focused mainly on the inner membrane particularly the cytoplasmic kinase domain of egfr the underlying mechanisms of the outer membrane remain unknown current insight into this regulation derives largely from studies around egfr-related microdomains so-called lipid rafts 10 – 13 which are thought to act as platforms for egfr signaling 14 15 these molecules are localized in the microdomains of the cell membrane and are usually rich in cholesterol glycosphingolipids and glycoproteins 15 – 17 several studies have associated glycosphingolipids including gangliosides gm1 gm3 and gd3 with the regulation of egfr signaling 18 – 20 in addition to glycosphingolipids some glycoproteins that are located in the egfr-related lipid rafts play important roles in the regulation of egfr signaling 12 13 21 – 23 these limited results highlight the possibility that glycosylation might act as a linker in lipid rafts for the regulation of egfr however little is known about how glycosylation controls regulation therefore elucidation of the underlying mechanisms involved in the glycosylation-mediated regulation of egfr is very important for a complete view of the biological functions of egfr integrins are important members of the egfr lipid raft-related glycoproteins as mentioned above and are major carriers of n -glycans which are thought to play crucial roles in many biological functions in response to cell adhesion integrins not only directly initiate certain cytoplasmic signals for cell spreading but also indirectly modulate the transmission of egfr signaling which is referred to as cross-talk 24 – 30 the integrins mediate cooperation with egfr mainly through α-cytoplasmic domains 31 which are also restricted to the inner membrane until recently integrin α5β1 a major fibronectin receptor was believed to be a well characterized integrin with n -glycosylation functions in cell adhesion 32 33 however the function of n -glycosylation on cell proliferation and cellular signaling remains unclear in fact there have been several controversial reports about the regulation of egfr-mediated signaling by integrin α5 34 35 to resolve these issues we have examined the relationship between integrin α5 and egfr and found that the expression of integrin α5 negatively regulates egfr-mediated cellular signaling and cell proliferation we used n -glycosylation mutants of integrin α5 to clarify the roles of the n -glycosylation of α5 in egfr-mediated signaling and cross-talk with egfr and found that the regulation was strictly controlled via the n -glycans of integrin α5 particularly the n -glycans on the calf-1,2 domain our results clearly demonstrate the importance of the n -glycans of integrin in the regulation of egfr-mediated cellular signaling and provide new insights into the cross-talk between growth factor receptors and integrins the experiments were performed using the following antibodies mabs

α5 cooperates with egfr to drive cell cycle progression 40 we established a simple cell model to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism for the cooperation between integrin α5 and egfr first human egfr cdna was transfected into the cho-b2 cell line that lacks the α5 subunit in order to establish a stable egfr-overexpressed cho-b2 cell line cho-b2/egfr the cho-b2/egfr cells then were respectively reconstituted with either a gfp-tagged wild-type wt or a n -glycosylation mutant α5 subunit s3–5 which contained only three of the 14 n -glycosylation sites fig 1 a the three sites on the β-propeller domain of integrin α5 are essential for α5β1 heterodimerization cell surface expression and cell adhesion in cho-b2 cells 33 as shown in fig 1 b when analyzed by flow cytometry analysis and biotinylation these cells exhibited almost the same expression levels of egfr and α5β1 on the cell surface and in the whole-cell lysates suggesting that the level of α5 subunits had no effect on the expression of egfr unexpectedly the expression of wt but not s3–5 α5 subunits significantly suppressed cell proliferation compared with those found in control cells with or without overexpression of a gfp tag only fig 1 c the colony formation consistently included colony numbers fig 1 d and sizes data not shown that were clearly decreased in the wt compared with those in the s3–5 and control

exception of sites 3–5 of integrin α5 play an important role in the inhibition of cell growth and tumorigenicity considering the overexpression of egfr in these cells we wondered whether egfr-mediated cellular signaling was modulated by α5 surprisingly under normal culture conditions the phosphorylation levels of egfr and its downstream molecules erk and akt were significantly decreased in wt cells compared with those in other cells fig 2 a furthermore the responses for exogenous egf-induced cell proliferation fig 2 b and cellular signaling fig 2 c were also significantly suppressed in wt cells

c-met or vegfr 41 thus we next investigated the contributions of egfr to cell growth both the phosphorylation levels of egfr and erk were completely blocked in the presence of anti-egfr blocking antibody fig 2 d meanwhile the abilities and differences among cells for cell proliferation were largely cancelled fig 2 e together these results supported our hypothesis that the n -glycosylation-mediated inhibitory effects of α5 on cell growth happen primarily thorough egfr signaling as described above α5 negatively regulated egfr-mediated signaling via n -glycosylation in cho-b2/egfr cells therefore we selected several human cancer cell lines such as hela u-251mg and mda-mb-231 cells which express relatively high levels of endogenous egfr in order to assess whether the phenomenon is common to other mammalian cells to eliminate influences from endogenous α5 that gene was deleted by using a crispr/cas9 knock-out system the knock-out efficiencies were assessed by flow cytometry analysis and western blot in hela u-251mg and mda-mb-231 cells figs 3 a and b and 4 a and b as shown in fig 3 c the ko hela cells exhibited an increased proliferation ability compared with the parent cells indicating that α5 also acts as a proliferation suppressor in hela cells furthermore the α5-ko cells were reconstituted with a gfp tag wt or s3–5 and each cell line showed similar expression levels of egfr figs 3 d and 4 c consistent with the data of cho-b2 cells the expression of wt cells had an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation figs 3 e and 4 d and g and phospho-egfr as

that in other cells fig 3 g almost the same tendencies were observed in the u-251mg and mda-mb-231 cells fig 4 f and i together these results further suggest that integrin α5 is a negative regulator for egfr-mediated signaling through n -glycosylation to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism we further employed cho-b2/egfr cells in subsequent experiments expression of integrin α5 inhibits cell growth and egfr cellular signaling in hela cells a and b the efficiency of the knock-out of the α5 gene using the crisp/cas9 system was assessed by flow cytometry analysis a and wb b the integrin

which ultimately regulate its signal amplification and propagation 42 also integrins are known to regulate the trafficking of some membrane proteins 43 therefore we conducted a biotinylation-based internalization assay fig 5 a and an egf-555-based egfr endocytosis assay fig 5 b in order to determine if the kinetics of egfr internalization are affected by α5 to increase sensitivity for detection primaquine a receptor recycling inhibitor was added to the culture medium to block the recycling of internalized egfr to the cell membrane for the egf-555-based egfr endocytosis assay the cells were stimulated by egf-555 at 10 30 and 50 ng/ml concentrations which are approximately equal to 1 3 and 5 ng/ml egf respectively because the molecular mass of egf-555 ∼63 kda is about 10 times higher than that of egf 6 kda we found that the treatment at 50 ng/ml provided clear signals fig 5 b and this concentration was also used in other cells 18 a lower concentration such as 10 or 30 ng/ml showed no or only marginal endocytosis signals data not shown of particular interest the egfr internalization after egf treatment during the first 10-min duration was greatly retarded in the wt cells compared with that in both the s3–5 and control cells although the levels of the internalized egfr were similar at the 15-min chase point these results clearly indicated that egfr internalization was delayed by α5 via n -glycosylation which might explain why the egfr signaling was inhibited in the wt cells integrin α5 decreases egfr internalization upon egf stimulation in cho-b2 cells a the internalization of egfr was inhibited in wt cells compared with the other cells a biochemical internalization assay of egfr was performed as described under experimental procedures. the internalized egfrs at indicated times were immunoprecipitated by avidin-agarose and then subjected to wb for detection of egfr the cell lysates were used as controls to show similar expression levels of egfr among these cells b the rates of internalized egfr were statistically analyzed right n 3 individual experiments c egfr endocytosis was inhibited in the wt but not s3–5 cells upon egf stimulation shown is a representative image for egfr endocytosis after 50 ng/ml egf-555 treatment at the indicated times the image was merged with egf-555 and to-pro-3 staining d the numbers of internalized egf-555

the n -glycosylation of integrin α5 regulated egfr internalization and activation therefore we wondered how n -glycosylation participates in regulation and whether integrin α5 is associated with egfr through the n -glycosylation of α5 reciprocal immunoprecipitates with anti-gfp-agarose and anti-egfr antibody showed that integrin α5 indeed interacted with egfr fig 6 a which was consistent with previous reports 44 this interaction was significantly decreased in the s3–5 cells by comparison with wt fig 6 a the decreased interactions between s3–5 integrin and egfr were also observed in hela u-251mg and mda-mb-231 cells fig 6 b these results suggest that the n -glycosylation of integrin α5 is required for the interaction between integrin α5 and egfr next we wondered whether this interaction is also modulated by egf stimulation as shown in fig 6 c the interaction was decreased following egf stimulation both in wt and s3–5 cells additionally the interaction was enhanced when those cells were attached to fn-coated dishes but it was decreased upon egf stimulation these results strongly suggested that the interaction of egfr and integrin α5 restricts egfr activation and decreases egfr responsiveness upon egf treatment integrin α5 associates with egfr and regulates egfr localization in lipid rafts a the association of integrin α5 with egfr was decreased in s3–5 cells compared with the wt cells the indicated cho-b2 cell extracts were immunoprecipitated ip with anti-gfp agarose left panels or anti-egfr antibody right panels and then subjected to wb reciprocally followed by anti-egfr and integrin α5 antibodies for detection b the interaction between integrin α5 and egfr was also decreased in the hela u-251mg and mda-mb-231 s3–5 mutant cells the indicated cell extracts were immunoprecipitated as described in a crude cell extracts were also subjected to wb as input using the indicated antibodies bottom panels c the interaction between integrin α5 and egfr was decreased upon egf stimulation the indicated cho-b2 cells were cultured on dishes coated with or without 10 μg/ml fn for 24 h and then stimulated with or without egf at 0.1 ng/ml for 5 min the resultant cell lysates as an input bottom panels were directly blotted with anti-egfr and integrin α5 antibodies or immunoprecipitated with anti-gfp agarose top panels and then blotted with anti-egfr antibody d comparison of localization of egfr and integrin α5 in the lower density lipid rafts in the indicated cho-b2 distributions of integrin α5 and egfr from the indicated cell lysates in the lipid raft fractions were prepared as described under experimental procedures. fraction 1 is the top fraction of the gradient and fraction 12 is the bottom fraction the localization shifts of the integrin α5 and egfr are highlighted with gray dotted lines caveolin-1 cav-1 was used to act as a marker for lipid rafts e the complex of egfr and integrin α5 is mediated by gm1 the indicated cho-b2 cells were pretreated with or without methyl-β-cyclodextrin m- β -cd 10 m m for 1 h. after the treatment cell lysates were incubated with biotinylated cholera toxin b subunit ctb for another 1 h and then immunoprecipitated with avidin-agarose beads the immunoprecipitates were subjected to wb detected with anti-egfr and integrin α5 antibodies top panels the whole cell lysates were also subjected to wb with the indicated antibodies bottom panel as an input given the evidence that egfr localizes in the lipid rafts which results in its signal transduction 10 18 45 we speculated that the n -glycans on integrin α5 might affect the distribution of egfr in the lipid rafts on a cell membrane when using the optiprep density gradient ultracentrifugation method for lipid raft fractions the egfr and integrin α5 from each of the cell lines were basically distributed in the fractions ranging from 4 to 8 in which caveolin-1 a marker for lipid raft could be detected fig 6 d interestingly the distribution of egfr and α5 was shifted from the low-density fractions fractions 4 and 5 in the wt cells to higher density fractions fractions 6–8 in the s3–5 and control cells indicating that the n -glycans on integrin α5 may be a switch that influences egfr and integrin α5 localization on the cell membrane the glycosylation of integrin α5 could affect its translocation into or out of a glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomain 46 thus we tested its association with ganglioside gm1 and egfr in these cells co-immunoprecipitation using biotinylated cholera toxin subunit b which specifically binds ganglioside gm1 showed that the association of egfr and α5 was much higher in the wt cells than it was in either the s3–5 or the control cells fig 6 e these interactions among gm1 egfr and α5 were completely disrupted in the presence of methyl-β-cyclodextrin a cholesterol depletion reagent taken together these results clearly showed that the n -glycosylation of α5 plays a crucial role in its localization and complex formation with other receptors on the cell membrane the data provided above led us to seek the n -glycosylation site s of α5 that was essential for its growth inhibitory effect to address this we focused on the n -glycosylation of the calf domain sites 10–14 fig 7 a which happens in the vicinity of the cell membrane therefore we restored n -glycosylation on the calf domain in the s3–5 mutant cells s3–5,10–14 both of the n -glycosylation-rescued cell lines δ10–14 and s3–5,10–14 exhibited similar expression levels of egfr and α5β1 on the cell surface fig 7 b and abilities for cell spreading on fn fig 7 c compared with those in the s3–5 cells restoration of n -glycosylation on the calf domain in the s3–5 mutant s3–5,10–14 decreased cell proliferation which was similar to that in wt cells fig 7 d furthermore deletion of the n -glycosylation sites on the calf domain δ10–14 of α5 abolished its inhibitory effects on cell growth fig 7 d these results indicated that n -glycosylation on sites 10–14 of α5 plays a crucial role in its inhibitory functions consistently the levels of phospho-egfr phospho-erk and phospho-akt in s3–5,10–14 cells were similar to those in the wt but different from those in s3–5 or δ10–14 cells fig 7 e the attenuated response to egf in wt cells was also observed in s3–5,10–14 but not δ10–14 cells fig 7 f the decreased association with egfr fig 7 g and the aberrant localization of egfr and α5 in lipid rafts fig 7 h in s3–5 cells could be reversed in the s3–5,10–14 cells which was similar to the situation in the wt cells taken together these results clearly showed that the n -glycosylation on the calf-1,2 domain of integrin α5 plays a crucial role in the regulation of egfr-mediated cell signaling which demonstrates a novel regulator for egfr inhibition n -glycosylation on the calf-1,2 domain of integrin α5 mediates its growth-inhibitory function a schematic diagram of potential n -glycosylation mutational integrin α5 subunit wt s3–5 δ10–14 and s3–5,10–14 b the integrin α5 mutant cells express equally α5β1 and egfr levels on cell surface compared with the wt cells the stable rescued cho-b2 cell lines 10–14 and s3–5,10–14 were also established as described under experimental procedures. the expression levels of both α5β1 and egfr on cell surface were analyzed by flow cytometry analysis the igg was used as a control c the α5 mutant cells exhibited comparable abilities for cell spreading as wt ones cells were detached and then replanted on the fn-coated dishes after incubation for 20 min cells were fixed and the images were taken the percentages of the rounded spread and elongated cells were statistically analyzed bottom panel n 9 from triplicate experiments d the s3–5,10–14 but not 10–14 cells exhibit a similar inhibitory ability for cell growth compared with the wt cells the cell growth abilities of wt s3–5,10–14 and s3–5 10–14 were analyzed as described

growth could be down-regulated by integrin α5 and clearly demonstrate how the n -glycosylation of α5 is a key factor for α5 regulation of egfr signaling among 14 potential n -glycosylation sites of α5 sites on the calf domain played a crucial role in the inhibitory effect on egfr-mediated signaling through regulation of the complex formation between egfr and α5 localization in lipid rafts and internalization fig 8 thus the present study outlines the novel underlying mechanism responsible for the inhibition of egfr and also provides new insight into the role of n -glycosylation in the regulation of cellular signaling to maintain cell properties via a cross-talk manner among glycoproteins on the cell surface proposed molecular mechanism for the regulation of egfr cellular signaling by the n -glycosylations of integrin α5 in the integrin α5 with n -glycosylation on its calf domain cells left integrin α5β1 forms a complex with egfr as well as glycosphingolipids in the lipid raft which may restrict the egfr internalization and the related signaling upon egf stimulation resulting in an inhibition of cell proliferation however in the integrin α5-deficient or mutant deletion of n -glycosylation on its calf domain cells right the majority of egfr is located in lipid rafts without integrin α5 leading to a rapid activation and internalization of egfr upon egf stimulation the thick arrow lines indicate a rapid egf response and strong signal transduction whereas the thinner arrow lines indicate that these events are inhibited integrin α5 is thought to play crucial roles in many biological functions but there are several controversial reports concerning the functions of integrin α5 in cancer low expression levels of α5 have been linked to the growth of tumors in gastric colorectal colon and breast cancers 47 whereas the overexpression of integrin α5 inhibited cell growth in several cell lines such as 4t1 ht29 and cho 48 – 52 furthermore integrin α5 has been used to down-regulate the her2 pathway in caco-2 and ht-29 cells 34 however these findings are contradicted by other studies showing that integrin α5 functions as an oncogene and was associated with several instances of tumorigenesis 53 54 as well as promoting egfr activation in some cancer cells 35 44 55 the reasons for the contradictions in the functioning of α5 in cancers remain unclear of course it could be speculated that α5 might differentially affect cellular signaling in different cell types or may exhibit intrinsic limitations in different cell models however based on our observation integrin α5 inhibits cell proliferation through a negative regulation of egfr via n -glycosylation and shows tumor suppressor-like activity coincidently similar to integrin α5 integrin α1 also negatively regulated egfr 26 we believe that the different effects of α5 on cell growth can be ascribed to distinct n -glycosylations which may be altered in different cells and tissues and cancers further investigation is obviously needed to support this hypothesis the n -glycosylation of integrin α5 plays crucial roles in several biological functions including cell adhesion and cell migration however little is known about the functioning of individual n -glycosylation we previously underscored the importance of n -glycans on n -glycosylation potential sites 3–5 of α5 in its assembly of β1 33 although the interaction-mediated cross-talk between α5 and egfr was described previously 41 44 the precise underlying mechanisms of how α5 regulates egfr signaling and the molecular basis for this interaction remain unclear in the present study we find that the n -glycosylation on the calf domain is essential for integrin α5-egfr complex formation and is a key regulator for egfr-mediated signaling most studies have focused on the cytoplasmic domain of integrins for the regulation of cell functions for example caswell et al 56 reported that the rab-coupling protein could mediate the complex formation between integrin α5 and egfr through their cytoplasmic domains to regulate cell migration mattila et al 26 described how integrin α1 negatively regulates egfr-mediated cellular signaling through the activation of a protein tyrosine phosphatase in the cytosol these theories are plausible because any output downstream must happen inside a cell however these explanations are insufficient to clarify the molecular mechanisms in detail in the present study we highlight an input upstream post-translational modification of the extracellular domains of α5 and show its importance in complex formation and cellular signaling similar to integrin α5 we previously showed how the n -glycosylation on integrin β4 regulates its association with egfr and egfr signaling 12 recently paszek et al 22 demonstrated that a bulky glycocalyx in ecm might facilitate integrin clustering and then promote a tumor phenotype by increasing integrin adhesion and signaling those results further support the notion that glycosylation plays an important role in protein-protein interaction 57 it is worth noting that the n -glycans on the calf domain of α5 represent a key switch for the regulation of egfr-mediated signaling previous study of the crystal structure of the ectodomain of integrin α5β1 showed that the n -glycans on α5 particularly those surrounding the rgd-binding pocket play an important role in its binding to fn 58 thus based on molecular modeling we speculate that the n -glycans of a calf domain may not participate in the cell adhesion process but instead a location near the cell membrane suggests that they may be involved in the association with other molecules on the cell surface in fact restoration of all n -glycosylation sites on the calf domain sites 10–14 in an s3–5 mutant completely rescued the complex formation and the capacity for inhibitory effects of egfr-mediated signaling which were observed in wild-type α5-expressing cells in consideration of the fact that the specific conformation of integrin α5β1 is essential for its mediated functions 59 – 61 future studies will require an extensive analysis of the structures of these n -glycosylation mutants as well as that of specific n -glycans on individual sites it is well known that an appropriate lipid raft formation is required for normal egfr signaling transduction 62 63 we demonstrate here that n -glycosylation on integrin α5 serves as a regulator for its association with egfr and gm1 one of the gangliosides in lipid rafts which regulates the egf response in fact other gangliosides such as gm3 and gd3 can also interact with the n -glycans on egfr and regulate egfr signaling indicating the importance of the carbohydrate-to-carbohydrate interaction in cellular signaling 12 18 20 62 63 these results lead us to speculate that the n -glycans on the calf domain may be the most suitable for those interactions among the α5 egfr and gangliosides at a distance of course more evidence is needed to prove this hypothesis although the underlying mechanism for the complex formation that down-regulates egfr internalization upon egf stimulation remains unclear the observation could partly explain why the cell growth was inhibited in the wild-type α5 cells because enhancement of egfr internalization and recycling plays an important role in signal transduction for persistent proliferation and tumor carcinogenesis in cells 42 64 given the existence of the mutations of several integrins and egfr during pathological processes 65 – 67 particularly the n -glycosylation mutation of integrin α3 68 and the apparent irregular expression of integrin α5 in multiple tumors 47 53 54 it is tempting to speculate that the n -glycosylation of integrin α5 may undergo mutations during tumorigenesis integrin α5 modified by different n -glycosylations exhibited different effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenesis suggesting a possibility that the remodeling of n -glycosylation on this integrin may serve as a novel approach to tumor treatment furthermore the present study clearly demonstrates how specific n -glycosylation on integrin α5 functions as a negative regulator for egfr which may provide a new perspective on the cross-talk between growth factor receptors and integrins q. h. performed all of the experiments with the help of
