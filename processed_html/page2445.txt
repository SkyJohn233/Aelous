The Sensational Alex Harvey Band – Tomorrow Belongs to Me Lyrics | Genius Lyrics The sun on the meadow is summery warm The stag in the forest runs free But gathered together we ' ll meet the storm Tomorrow Belongs To Me The branch of the Linden is leafy and green The rage has deserted the sea The world holds a promise that shines unseen Tomorrow Belongs To Me The babe in his cradle is soundly asleep The blossom embraces the bee And love like a valley lies wide and deep Tomorrow Belongs To Me Oh father Oh father Oh show us a sign Your children have waited to see The morning will come when the world is mine Tomorrow Belongs To Me Father Oh father Oh show us a sign Your children have waited to see The morning will come when the world is mine Tomorrow belongs, tomorrow belongs Tomorrow belongs to thee Tomorrow belongs, tomorrow belongs Tomorrow belongs to thee Tomorrow belongs, Tomorrow belongs, Tomorrow belongs to thee The morning will come when the world is thine Tomorrow Belongs To Me
