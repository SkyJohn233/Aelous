Indian Standard ( First Revision )  BIS 2009 Price Group 7 FOREWORD This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council. This standard was first published in 1965. The-present revision has been taken up with a view to keeping abreast with the rapid development in the field of construction technology and concrete design and also to bring further modifications in the light of experience gained while applying the earlier version of this standard and the amendment issued. The design and construction methods in reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete structures for the storage of liquids are influenced by the prevailing construction practices, the physical properties of the materials and the climatic condition. To lay down uniform requirements of structures for the storage of liquids giving due consideration to the above mentioned factors, this standard has been published in four parts, the other parts in the series are: (Part 2) : 2009 Reinforced concrete structures (Part 3) : 1967 Prestressed concrete structures (Part 4) : 1967 Design table While the common methods of design and construction have been covered in this standard, for design of structures of special forms or in unusual circumstances, special literature may be referred to or in such cases special systems of design and construction may be permitted on production of satisfactory evidence regarding their adequacy and safety by analysis or test or by both. In this standard it has been assumed that the design of liquid retaining structures, whether of plain, reinforced or prestressed concrete is entrusted to a qualified engineer and that the execution of the work is carried out under the direction of a qualified and experienced supervisor. The concrete csed in liquid retaining structures should have low permeability, This is important not only for its direct effect on leakage but also hecause it is one of the main factors influencing durability; resistance to leaching, chemical attack, erosion, abrasion and frost damage; and the protection from corrosion of emhedded steel. The standard, therefore, incorporates provisions in design and construction to take care of this aspect. The requirements of IS 456 : 2000  ' Code of practice for plain and reinforced concrete (fourth revision) '  and IS 1343 : 1980  ' Code of practice for prestressed concrete (first revision) ' , in so far as they apply, shall be deemed to form part of this standard except where otherwise laid down in this standard. For a good design and construction of structure, use of dense concrete, adequate concrete cover, good detailing practices, control of cracking, good quality assurance measures in line with IS 456 and good construction practices particularly in relation to construction joints should be ensured. This revision incorporates a number of important modifications and changes, the most important of them being: a) Scope has been clarified further by mentioning exclusion of dams, pipes, pipelines, lined structures and damp-proofing of basements, b) c) Provisions for concrete have been modified in .Iine with IS 456: 2000 with minimum grade o( ' concrete as M20 for plain cement concrete, M30 for reinforced concrete and M40 for prestressed concrete (see also Note 2 under Table I), d) The maximum cement content has been modified from the earlier requirement of 530 kg/rn "  to 400 kg/m ' , e) A dau~e on d.urability It.as been added giving due reference to IS 456 in place of earlier clause on protection against corrosion, f) Indian Standard ( First Revision) 1 SCOPE 2 REFERENCES The standards listed in Annex A contain provisions, which through reference in this text, constitute provisions of this standard. At the time of publication, the editions indicated were valid. All standards are subject to revision and parties to agreements based on this standard are encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying the most recent editions of the standards as given in Annex A. 3 MATERIAI.S 3.1 The requirements for materials shall be governed by IS 456 and IS 1343 for reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete members respectively. with the following additional requirements. 4 EXPOSURE CONDmON For the purpose of this standard, parts of the structure retaining the liquid or enclosing the space above the liquid shall be considered as subject to  ' severe ' condition as per IS 456. In case of members exposed to  ' very severe '  or  ' extreme '  conditions, the relevant provisions of IS 456 shall apply. 5 CONCRETE Provisions given in IS 456 and IS 1343 for concrete shall apply for reinforced concrete and prestressed members respectively subject to the following further requirements: a) The concrete shall conform to Table 1. b) The cement content not including f1yash and ground granulated blast furnace slag in excess of400 kglm) should not beused unless special consideration has been given in design to the increased risk. of cracking due to drying shrinkage in thin sections, or to early thermal cracking and to increased risk ofdamage due to alkali silica reactions. 6 DURABIUTY 6.1 The provisions for durability shall generally be SI Minimum Cement Content kglmJ No. (2) (I) i) Plainconcrete Reinforced concrete iii) Prestressed concrete ii) Mulmum FrecW.ter M1DImwn Gndeol Concrete (3) Cemmt Ratio (4) 250 320 0.50 0.45 M20 M30 360 0.40 M40 (5) NarES 1 Cementcement pn:scribed in this table is irrespective of the padcs of amellt and it is inclusive of addilions menlionedin 5.2 of IS456.

In elevated structures whererestraint issmall, movementjoints may not be required. There are three categories of movementjoints: I) Contraction joint - A movementjoint with a deliberate discontinuity but no initialgap between the concreteon either side of the joint, thejoint being intended to accommodate contraction of the concrete (see Fig. I). A distinction should be made between a complete contraction joint (see Fig. IA) and a partial contraction joint (see Fig. IB). While the complete contraction . joints are not restrainedto movementand are intended to accommodate only contraction of the concrete, the partial contractionjoints provide some restraint but are intended to accommodate some contraction of concrete.
