dead as well as all my grandparents and most of my aunts and uncles i had seen more death than most do in a lifetime i was pregnant multiple times outside of marriage which carries its own shame and embarrassment i had been homeless lived on government assistance and struggled to put food on the table as a single mom i had already parented alone for several years and had no way of knowing that i would go on to parent even more years alone and all of those things shaped me and molded me with fear but the journey i embarked upon a few years back was far worse than i could have even imagined eight years ago i decided to walk away from corporate america and accept this call on my life to minister to single moms nationally i was scared and felt ill-equipped but i did it anyway and the ministry quickly grew before long our ministry was ministering to thousands around the globe but for every success i experienced in ministry there was an even bigger attack personally first my husband lost his job and there was no money then my children were plagued with countless unforeseen surgeries and there was even less money eight surgeries later our family was pressed from every side financially and then there were the difficult teen years where i failed miserably in parenting and the times i secretly wanted to quit ministry altogether because i didn t feel i measured up it was during this difficult time that i actually declined every invitation i received from churches to speak the enemy had accomplished exactly what he wanted he had taken my voice fear had beaten me down and strangled the life from me it was gradual and i usually masked it well but most days i spent my time crying uncontrollably that s what fear does it strangles immobilizes subtracts withers crushes and shatters it grips our soul and snatches every dream what once was the joy of the lord somehow becomes replaced with anger and hopelessness fear encourages us to give up and accept the misery of existence versus the excitement of a god-led pursuit many christians are struggling with fear and allowing it to take our voice and strangle us â€“ secretly and slowly yet our father in heaven paid for us to have an abundant life free from fear and worry and anxiety there are three things that we can do that will allows us to master fear and move into the freedom christ paid for us to have acknowledge what fear is if fear didn t come from the lord then who gave it to us as christians we must understand that fear was given to us by satan as a mere tactic to keep us distracted and off course for the plans the lord has for us we must understand it for what is then realize we have the authority to dispel fear with the power of christ s shed blood for god has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity but of power love and sound mind 1 timothy 1:7 seek god until he takes away our fears keep pursuing freedom from fear even when everything around you seems scary and hopeless and
