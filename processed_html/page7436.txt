This blog is the foundation of everything we do at SweetGeorgia and allows us to share what we're making and learning. Today, our blog is written by a team of contributors, including designers, spinners, knitters, weavers, and more. Inspired by our shared passion and obsessive desire to make and learn, we explore projects, techniques, and ideas around how to bring more colour and craft to our lives. Join our community of SweetGeorgia knitters and spinners, makers and crafters. You'll get weekly inspiration and updates as well as access to our exclusive "Secret Stash" projects and more. Plus, we'll send you a free pattern bundle of eight easy-to-knit accessories patterns. Success! Now check your email to confirm your subscription. There was an error submitting your subscription.
