Is buying gold an option at all? : financialindependence I have a friend that I talk to about FI alot and he &# x27;s the only person that I even look at managing my money and investing and things like that. We were talking the other day about our specific plans to invest and while mine was Vanguard index funds his was real estate and gold. I can see how the real estate would be a good investment, but I cant really see why he would want to buy gold. Could anyone enlighten me? No. I mean, you could do worse, but Gold is a stupid investment. For the period 1928-2013, the average annual compound real return of stocks = 6.3% and gold = 2.0%. However, the price of gold was controlled by the government until the mid-70s when the US finally abandoned the gold standard. For the period 1976-2013, the average returns were stocks = 7.2% and gold = 2.0%. Source So Gold is a great investment if you want to piss away 2/3rds of your potential returns. And I don &# x27;t buy the  " OMG Apocolypse! "  argument either. In the event of that kind of devastation, there are things that would be worth more than gold and infinitely more useful. (Bullets, gasoline, Nuka-Cola Bottle Caps...) What &# x27;s doubly ludicrous, is that many goldbugs who worry about existential threats to the national government actually own paper gold anyway. If their fears were actually realized I doubt they &# x27;d be able to dodge the roving mutant gangs long enough to cash in their gold certificates. I know at least one person who buries gold in their backyard, but again, the whole idea seems silly and I &# x27;m being deliberately sarcastic about it. You want to own something that generates real income. That &# x27;s wealth, not metal in the ground. Don &# x27;t own gold, instead, go buy a mine. (Or better yet, a low-cost diversified index fund that owns such things.) That fallout reference! Pretty much ditto. If you must own gold, own a gold ETF--either a gold mining company fund or a fund that actually purchases bullion. Don &# x27;t bother with coins in an safe deposit box. But mostly, there are just better investments. Sure, diversify a little and have  little  precious metals in your portfolio, but probably not more than 5%. Real estate depends a lot on where you live. In some places, you can buy a property with 20% down and immediately rent it out at a price that completely pays your PITI and then some. That &# x27;s completely aside from appreciation of the property itself. That &# x27;s basically a free house, and I &# x27;ll take that over buying gold any day. Of course, not every region has that dynamic. period 1928-2013,  the average annual compound real return of stocks = 6.3% I &# x27;m being nit picky, CAGR of S & P500 with dividend reinvestment  and  adjustment for inflation = 6.61% source Precious metals are not investments (unless you want to not even beat inflation most years), they are stores of wealth. Wouldn &# x27;t it be true that any store of wealth that doesn &# x27;t beat inflation isn &# x27;t really a store of wealth? I &# x27;m not trying to be pedantic, I just don &# x27;t see how, if your principal is eroding, you &# x27;re really storing wealth. Edit: I get it, I &# x27;m wrong. My thought was more about how we choose to store value. Not all stores of value are created equal. Check out the Permanent Portfolio returns and volatility. Compare that with a 50/50 Stocks and Bonds portfolio. Compare their numbers and graphs. You will be surprised, given the comments on this post. Gold is a hedge against inflation in the ultra long term only. In the last few decades Gold has  not  been a hedge against inflation. Gold is a hedge against the trustworthiness of  fiat currencies. As a tool used to diversify an already well rounded portfolio, gold and other precious metals are an excellent route. That said I can &# x27;t imagine it would be prudent to allocate any more than 10% of your bankroll into it. What does he say when you ask him? It sounds to me--and I &# x27;m just speculating, here, based on the motivations of other gold bugs I &# x27;ve run across--is that he &# x27;s not so much a gold bull as he is a dollar bear. But if you &# x27;re really a dollar bear there are MUCH better ways to short the dollar--the Vanguard internationals, for instance. To answer your question, gold can provide another avenue of diversification.  Say you &# x27;re invested in an already diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, but you want to increase your level of diversification.  Rather than add another stock or bond, adding gold will provide more diversification because it can be thought of as a hedge against stock/bond market risk.  The downside is it isn &# x27;t a productive asset. You could try a  permanent portfolio  which has a large (25%) gold component and has performed relatively well historically (decent returns and low volatility).  But I wouldn &# x27;t recommend buying a bunch of gold thinking that the economic system will fail and gold will save you.

It &# x27;s like saving in cash but more inflation procted (because the supply of gold is pretty constant it appricates in line with an increase in the money supply). I probably wouln &# x27;t do just gold but could def. be a part of an portfolio where instead of holding cash or T-bills you hold gold. Is that a legitimate fear? Who would buy the gold if currency collapses? I imagine things like food and hunting equipment would be more valuable in that situation, and I don &# x27;t think gold would help much. A good food storage would be far more valuable and is useful in a host of other situations as well. If you &# x27;re worried about the US economy collapsing, buy foreign stock, which should be in your portfolio anyway. Even then, the US economy collapsing will probably cause other markets to collapse as well (like we &# x27;ve seen with Greece &# x27;s situation, which is much smaller than the US), and would likely result in widespread war. I really don &# x27;t buy the currency collapse argument. The likelihood of that happening is so remote that it &# x27;s not worth special attention. Have a general disaster plan and enjoy life. I think gold can be a useful hedge, but it comes with a couple large drawbacks: There are high costs to holding it in a  " real "  form--to get physical gold, you &# x27;ll pay more than it &# x27;s worth, and even with gold-holding ETFs, you get a poor tax treatment. Gold doesn &# x27;t have great historic real returns, so you are unlikely to make a lot of money off it. On the other hand, gold has one significant advantage: it &# x27;s decoupled with the price of stocks, bonds, and real estate, so it &# x27;s unlikely to crash at the same time as everything else (and may even increase during that time). I plan to hold 1-3% precious metals in my portfolio. Gold has dive bombed in the last few years. The stock market has  " dive bombed "  in some years. Is that reason enough for you to never invest in it? I am not buying gold but your logic is flawed. https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/success/feel-wealthy/?utm_source=ADA_Optimizely & utm_campaign=horizontalstripbiztest & hpt=ob_blogfooterold This article did better at capturing our collective sentiments than most have. They went through the math of how much you could spend with a 3% SWR on $2.26M, and interviewed several people with different NW &# x27;s and different ways of getting there. To me, the fact that CNN is doing an article like this makes me think we might be a lot more mainstream than before. I would like to see more from them on this, maybe even a recurring segment with different financial tips. Would be cool if they did a long term  " ride along "  with someone on their path to FIRE. Our personal goal to RE is a bit higher than $2M, closer to $4M, but curious what others have to say. I &# x27;ve had the opportunity to see a relative acquire a good chunk of land in a beautiful location, build a fairly sized wood cabin and cultivate the land, collect water and use solar for energy, and I &# x27;ve never seen this relative so fulfilled, in fact he told me  " I &# x27;ve never been this content with life " , I &# x27;ve also had the great chance of experiencing some Homestead life for a few uninterrupted weeks and It changed my outlook on life in a pretty drastic way, akin to taking psychedelics for the first time, i.e experiencing a set of experiences you didn &# x27;t know were even available, they were hidden, and now you know and while the afterglow will dissipate you will never be the same again. This is one of the reasons I &# x27;m interested in FI, anyone else in a similar spot? Here is  Version 4.1 Please read the flow chart entirely before commenting since some redditors have been commenting or PMing of missing items; sometimes it’s just buried deep. Please provide  constructive criticism  where I will evaluate for the next version; if it’s needed. If you provide details on what exactly you’d like changed and provide justification, that can be sufficient to persuade me. I hope I fixed the viewing for mobile users if not, I am sorry. I think it depends on what app or interface you are using. I &# x27;ll be traveling tomorrow so I don &# x27;t know if I have much time to make another iteration, but I am quite happy with this version. I haven &# x27;t received any word from moderators if they wanted to put this in the sidebar or anything, so I &# x27;ll just assume that it &# x27;ll be stored in a post format for people to reference then. I hope you enjoy! Version History ; for those interested. Version 1.3 Version 2.0 Version 3.0 Version 3.1 Version 4.0 Given how close we are to the start of a new decade, I figured it might be fun for some of us to reminisce (and speculate). I bet a lot of us have come a long way. So please leave a comment answering three questions: Where were you (in the context of FIRE) ten years ago -- at the start of 2010? Where are you now -- at the start of 2020? Where do you plan to be in ten years -- at the start of 2030? I &# x27;ll go first in the comments. I ask this because I usually see employed people on this subreddit who want out of the work force, It &# x27;s very rare to see a small business owner who wants out despite dealing with much longer hours and stress. Would a lot of people looking to FIRE be happier self employed rather than doing nothing? 2009: 30 years old, $30k total savings. 2019: 40 years old, $300k invested. Ten years ago I was doing just fine. The deepest trough of the recession had passed, but it was still a pretty unsettling time. I was content to be in grad school, insulated from the outside world, with a steady stipend of $28k from a grant, plus an additional few k a year from doing translation work and academic consulting. I was saving the $4k / year max to my Roth most years and that was it. I was lucky to be in the ivory tower, mainly because I really enjoyed my thinking work, and enjoyed especially the scientific programming aspects of my biology research. I was good at being a graduate student. But I was also lucky because it seemed scary out there, and comfortable in here. Also, I had student loan debt that I could keep deferring while I was technically still a student. It took me a long time to leave the academic world. I bounced around with postdocs for a while, before finally making an intentional decision with my partner to move to put down roots. That was the single biggest factor in my current happiness, and in helping me move out of academic work. 10 years later, we have an old, lovely, expensive house in a neighborhood we would be happy to stay in forever. I have been working as a data scientist for the last three years. The goal of FI has been central in my decision making, helping me focus on maximizing my income now (within reason) to get free of the working world when I want. Knock on wood, I &# x27;ll hit my goal before 55, probably 50. I just crossed the $300k mark for my investments, excluding e-fund / house / other assets. I have no debt other than the mortgage. Lessons learned in the last decade: Leaving academia was the best financial and overall well-being decision I made Patiently sticking to a FI plan has been rewarding, and I thank this community for the inspiration. Edit: I appreciate the interest in how I made the transition to data science. I &# x27;ll make a post over in  r/datascience  sometime soon to explain more. As for others considering making the change from academia: Yes, life is good out here! I don &# x27;t see myself spending more than $40k a year. Obviously this can change depending on where life takes me, and emergencies and such down the line. With this, I would still have a generous savings account strictly for emergencies, so until something huge were to happen, I should still be covered. What I am wondering is if there is anything wrong with using a taxable investment account for the majority of my assets, and withdrawing ~$38,600 a year from that account. I am under the assumption that this would mean I would pay no gains tax as the gains would be considered long-term. If this was this case, would this be more beneficial for retiring early as I wouldn &# x27;t have to take any penalties when withdrawing from a Roth, or having to mess with a conversion ladder? Is this too simple? I feel like there has to be an issue with this method. TL;DR - Have one taxable account with most of my assets, withdraw ~$38,600 a year gains tax-free. Never have to deal with withdraw penalties or Roth conversion ladders. Would this work? Link:  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/14/business/retirement-social-security-recession.html Essentially, many of those issues are addressed head on in this community: proper research, long term planning, and managing expenses ensures we don &# x27;t end up in that predicament.  These factors opens up the doors to fi/re for essentially all income levels. So, I believe I ' m almost there, single, 40, 3.6M that ' s been growing steadily, but I ' m missing something critical here...like what do I actually do once I get to the supposed end where FIRE is near? (i.e. which things do I invest in, how do I actually start drawing down, the specific mechanics of it...) I haven ' t seen anything specifically detailing this stuff out. Sorry if this is clearly posted somewhere I missed... I recently started listening to David Sinclair ' s  ' Lifespan - Why We Age - and Why We Don ' t Have To. '   In the book he discusses what has been learned about the mechanisms of aging, and how we on the brink of emerging technologies and pharmaceuticals that can combat these mechanisms to allow us to live for much longer.  He emphasizes that this increased lifespan will also include a dramatically increased  ' healthspan ' , and envisions that within our lifetime we could see the average lifespan in developed countries increase by over 20 years.  80-90 year-olds could be traveling and hiking trails in full health, with another 20-30 years to look forward to. In the later chapters he discusses how this future, although idealistic on the surface, does harbor some complications when it comes to overpopulation (limited resources) and government.  It would lead to a very quick draw-down of social security funds, as the program was not designed for a population that would live much past mid-sixties.  The traditional age of retirement would be pushed back drastically for people to live comfortably into their new golden years.  People who worked in physically demanding jobs for 30-40+ years would need to continue their back-breaking work into their 70s+ (although in better health) or else learn new marketable skills.  If caught in the middle of their career during this technological breakthrough, they may reconsider their college degree or lack thereof altogether. As with most emerging technologies, the initial onset of age-combating drugs will likely be prohibitively expensive.  For as much as a late-stage capitalism dystopia it may sound like, the wealthy will inevitably be the first to benefit from these technologies, conjuring thoughts of Mr. Burns-like immortals.  Then, even when it becomes mainstream, the wealthy will enjoy all the benefits of their extra years without the worry of money. Being financially independent in a time like this could effectively double the value you get from the 25x+ yearly expenses nest egg, where value is measured as healthy years not working.  Also, having the money available to benefit from these technologies early on could literally buy you time.  In this future, there is a much higher incentive to make financial independence a goal.  It wouldn ' t be surprising if the temperance typically preached in these types of communities becomes a much more embraced virtue in a future of increasing population. Edit- A couple posts seem to think this is impossible for the sole reason that they haven’t seen it before. These drugs are already proven to extend the life of mice, worms, apes, etc. but are not fully tested on humans (and take a while to do so as we tend to live pretty long as it is). Healthy skepticism is great, but I’d encourage those outright disregarding the possibility of life extending technologies to respect what science has given us thus far, and respect that it will continue to provide incredible advancements for us in the future. I ' ve built a New Zealand FI flow chart based on the original hard work by  u/happyasianpanda  here on  r/financialindependence  on the US FI Flowchart. NZ ' s a lot simpler and hopefully I ' ve laid out the steps in roughly the right order. This is Version 0.5 and based on feedback I ' ll look to put out an updated version sometime before Christmas Either add a comment below or PM me around improvements, corrections, missing items etc. This is intended as a general information and not financial advise. Please only give feedback in relation to NZ. Ver 0.5
