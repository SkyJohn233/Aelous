If you on my IG you'll see that as my goal in my bio. I know the struggles of sterotype and all the ups and downs that's in the industry as well as personal real life scenerios. I wanted to create a segment where I get to talk about it all with none other then a GIRL BOSS! In this video I interview Karla Jara aka TheeRealKarlaJ and she shares with us some exclusive information about her life, her new makeup collection  and her future.
