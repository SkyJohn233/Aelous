ajpl i m the only one of my friends who owns any models and haven t really been able to get epic play games together so far so i hadn t previously considered the huge ships to be worth the purchase however i just discovered that the huge ships come with cinematic campaign missions and now i m super intrigued hopefully my group will be too so i m wondering what i would need to own in order to play the cinematic missions from the huge expansions particularly the imperial raider and the corvette does each mission come with a set starfighter complement that you need to own the right models for or is it just build two lists with specific objectives also do we know anything about the missions in the imperial assault carrier i couldn t find anything post a comment – tavernkeep everyone

i don t own the corvette yet but the raider campaign requires a lambda a spare tie advanced as well as enough spare ships for 160pts rebels and 80pts imperial iirc – ajpl s 0 points 1 point 2 points 3 years ago 0 children perfect thanks – deleted 0 points 1 point 2 points 3 years ago 3 children i ve played through the transport campaign twice because it was so much fun and have also played the raider campaign i ve gotten reports that the tantive campaign isn t as good i like the transport campaign a lot the rebels make a small list of limited resources that they have to use for all three missions if a named character dies they re gone the imperials need to plan out which ships they are using for all missions ahead of time there are nice bonuses for winning a mission that makes it feel like it really matters in the next one the raider campaign seems to do a decent job with theme in one mission the imperial goal was to capture rebel ships if they were successful the next mission hput rebel captive on the raider for the next mission which was a really nice touch if they were unsuccessful a completely different mission showed up next – ajpl s 0 points 1 point 2 points 3 years ago 2 children oohh cool the one thing i ve heard about the transport mission is that you need three gr-75s to play it is that true – deleted 0 points 1 point 2 points 3 years ago 1 child no there s a crazy standalone mission in the book with three but it s not part of the campaign – ajpl s 0 points 1 point 2 points 3 years ago 0 children oh good haha i had written that one off completely so that s great
