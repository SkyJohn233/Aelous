Wealth and Financial Independence/Retire Early Hot Hot This sub is for people pursuing financial independence and/or early retirement with a great lifestyle. This is the opposite of the leanFIRE model to get out of work life ASAP. You can achieve financial independence and early retirement without compromising your lifestyle. This requires a larger nest egg than a typical leanFIRE or FIRE goal. On this sub, we choose both  abundance and sustainability . No judgement. Everyone decides for himself/herself what is  " enough "  in life. If you &# x27;re shooting for the stars and OP is shooting for the edge of the universe, just shrug and ask  " Why not? " . Be courteous and positive. So no insults and harassment, including calling out liars or gurus (use the report button instead). Text posts only. You can link to outside resources from within your post. Stick to quality posts  &  discussions, specific to the fatFIRE pursuit and lifestyle. This means NO  " how-to start " ,  " inspiration "  or other basic posts. [Disclaimer: I don &# x27;t think I &# x27;ve discovered something that you all don &# x27;t already know. I &# x27;m looking for someone to tell me what I &# x27;m missing.] Can someone patiently explain (maybe ELI5) to me why everyone wouldn &# x27;t automatically do real estate as their investment? I can understand not investing in Real Estate for the following reasons: > $5mm cash to invest  - If I HAD $5mm to get even 5% reliably, I wouldn &# x27;t bother with the headache of real estate No time -  Not everyone has the luxury to spare a few hours here and there Retiring imminently  - If your house value drops 40% next year, that &# x27;ll hurt if you &# x27;re 65. If you &# x27;re 30, you can wait it out assuming you didn &# x27;t buy into a bubble. You can get a better ROI for your time elsewhere . I &# x27;m a newbie RE investor, a couple years in with a few properties. But, with very little down payment, I can leverage large purchases, and have them paid down by tenants. Yes, its a bit more work than an ETF, but my $15-30k (assuming you can do 5-10% down) can get me a $300k asset under my control that gives me tax write offs, appreciation, rent increases, and loan pay down. Lets say I have $20k of extra headache for any incidentals before it is financially essentially self sufficient (if not cash-flowing).  Yes I am counting my few hours a month of coordinating maintenance and finding new tenants as  &# x27;free labor &# x27; but you can quantify it if you like, and I &# x27;m still missing why you wouldn &# x27;t do this unless you meet one of the aforementioned criteria. As a summary, my ($30k + $20k = ) $50k got me: $300k asset appreciating at 5-10% per year, After 10 years, my asset is worth  $479k (assuming the depressing 4.7% return from Forbes ) $545k (assuming 6% appreciation) , lets just make a huge under-assumption and say I have $479k - (purchase price) $300k =   $179k of value in equity. Tax reduction  by tens of thousands per year with depreciation and interest Cash flow of lets say  $150 per month * 104%  (rent increase estimate) per year When the LTV gets to be  < 50%, I can refinance to draw the cash out tax-free to replay this game multiple times over. All, Any opinions on real estate vs. stocks for young Europeans? I feel swayed by the leverage RE can give me but it is significant, illiquid money in a hot market. Regardless, even with a ~1% cap gain through housing prices this method significantly outperforms the average stock market performance over a 5-7 period (assuming 85-90% leverage vs. 5-7% performance on the stock market). My cashflow can handle vacancy as well as any one-off maintenance costs and have high job stability ( " High Finance "  type job). I &# x27;d outsource all landlord issues to a 3rd party, that &# x27;s common here to do as it gives you a tax benefit. Strongly struggling with the question and if I &# x27;m missing anything. Any opinions / advice? Thanks in advance For those who don’t know, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain offer permanent residence path through investments. About 500k Euro or less. Once you obtain the Visa, you are eligible for their public healthcare and travel all over Schengen area. I start paying attention because I have grown increasingly worried about how expensive healthcare in America is. I’d say 500k Euro is very doable for folks in this sub. Any opinions about this matter? Hey gang, You’re the group I trust most to know the right places to go to ensure my family are safe and comfortable during a 18-24 month relocation abroad. Like the title says I’m moving to Singapore on a company sponsored program. I’m an executive covering about a third of one of our tier 1 P & L’s globally. I’ll still be traveling a fair bit, so my family will need to be comfortable and have a community for support. Can anyone recommend something, particularly an online community my wife can participate in to build some confidence before we take the plunge? Thanks, CD Hi there, happy holidays to all. Has anyone used or recommend a concierge travel service that will facilitate transportation /booking activities / general itinerary while abroad? I’m looking for help with the logistics and especially in countries that are trickier to travel to? It doesn’t have to be super detailed, just some help /general guidance. I know Morgan Stanley and some other investment banks offer this but I’m wondering if there’s something a little more niche that just does travel as opposed to it being part of a full advisory offering. I found a vacation home two hours from my home. Close to where I grew up. Has acreage (5), trees (I love trees) and privacy. House is 20 years old in good shape.   I want to buy it as a vacation property for me.  I am 63 years old, single, no kids.  Here are the facts:  my net worth is 4,000,000.  1.25 million in cd &# x27;s at 2.7 to 3 %, 1 million in  in bonds, 250,000 in stock index fund,  150,000 individual stocks,  500,000 in bond funds, the rest in treasury money markets and cash.  I think it would be a good addition for diversification but I am retired so my portfolio has to sustain my lifestyle. I currently spend around 70,000 a year Any thoughts on whether this is a stupid idea are appreciated. We had spent roughly $60k a year and planned on FIRE once $1.5M was saved in investable assets. I started a side business to expedite our FI date. It &# x27;s been a lot more work that I &# x27;ve anticipated but I finally found the entrepreneurial fulfillment I didn &# x27;t know I was looking for. This is an e-com business and due to the holiday season, for the first time ever I made more money in a month from my side-business than from my 9-5 job. I understand things will slow as the business is seasonal. But this got me thinking...should I just quit now? I found my passion but if I take the leap there is a risk of not hitting our FI number...but if I &# x27;m able to spend my time on passion, maybe that doesn &# x27;t matter anymore? -Questions? I was hoping to find passion in my day-job but it hasn &# x27;t happened yet. I like the people I work with but the work isn &# x27;t clicking with me. Still, its not necessarily hard/stressful work and it seems like a big leap to walk away from a $120k/year fixed income. Still, if I quit, I &# x27;ll have more freedom to live the life I want to live to focus on myself, my family, and my business. But my business is very vulnerable in a recession…it &# x27;s discretionary products I sell. If I leave the $120k/year job, could we live off of my wife &# x27;s income without having to start drawdown? Or what is safe withdrawal rate we have to do to ensure our portfolio still grows over time? Is it worth dropping the high-pay job and put FI in jeopardy? The original goal was to his the 1.5M first (3-5 years on current pay) and THEN run my business basically risk free....But I dread going into the office and attending meetings when I could be doing more fulfilling things with my time. What would you do in my situation? What &# x27;s the risk, what the reward? Curious to hear the community &# x27;s thoughts and opinions. Thanks!
