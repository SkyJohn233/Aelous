tagaytay a quick weekend getaway marxtermind.com marxtermind.com by john marx velasco january 27 2014 tagaytay is always been a favorite destination for a quick weekend getaway by people coming from mega manila aside from its close proximity from the capital region the city is a desired destination because of its cool weather nice attractions and delectable food tagaytay is also an access to several nearby spots like taal lake and various beaches in batangas when in tagaytay you ll never really run out of things and places to try as new sites hotels and restaurants open month by month like last year when we did a side trip coming from an overnight stay in one of the beaches in calatagan batangas and tried the recently opened sky ranch sky ranch is a leisure park developed by sm land commercial property it is beside the taal vista hotel along aguinaldo highway the park is open daily with admission ticket that costs php 50 per person rides like super viking sky jump express train carousel sky eye and other fun attractions are available in the said park each rides costs a corresponding fee we had tried the sky eye for php 150 per person which was said to be the tallest ferris wheel in the country the ride gives an even much higher view of the taal lake and taal volcano the ride was so fun okay put heights and breezy weather into one it was a little bit nerve-racking one of the reasons that people also go to tagaytay is because of the famous dish/soup bulalo bulalo is a filipino stew made from beef shanks and marrow bones it is native to the southern luzon region of the country last year i was able to try two places that serve the famous dish bulalo point and at the tagaytay s market place both are actually good but i have to say that it s the one in the market place that won my taste also another type of dish that is also a favorite from numerous tagaytay restaurants and eateries is the tawilis tawilis is type of fish that is native to batangas since it can only be found at taal lake it can be cooked in so many ways but it s the crispy one that i was able to like the most if you re a person who don t like to spend too much in the accommodation and
