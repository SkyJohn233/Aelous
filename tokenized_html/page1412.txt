wake up rock dinosaurs – kanye west belongs at glastonbury hadley freeman opinion the guardian contact author wed 25 mar 2015 13.48 edt last modified on thu 22 feb 2018 07.04 est t he fortunes of marks spencer whether the us president is friendly to the british prime minister who s headlining at glastonbury these are not actually updated lyrics to my favourite things from the sound of music – rather they are today s sources of english national identity given that england can no longer find validation in team sports the english must seek alternative outlets to ascertain their place in the world outlets that manage to be even more meaningless than whether a bunch of men have kicked a ball into a net what was it england that norma desmond said about the pictures getting smaller what with president obama too busy wooing prince charles for some reason to make his opinion on david cameron known and m s apparently still existing our point of order today is who is headlining at glastonbury this summer it was recently announced that kanye west shall assume that mantle on the saturday night and as you have presumably heard this has made some people absolutely furious as is the way with such things now an online petition has started that now has 130,000 signatures on it even though glastonbury only sells 135,000 tickets i honestly do not know how the western world functioned before the existence of online petitions enabled us all to transmute our personal vague dislike of something kanye west the suspension of jeremy clarkson into something urgently political that requires immediate redressing britain should just scrap the union jack and get a giant white banner with change.org splashed across it to capture the mood of the country this particular petition was started by a young chap who has deemed kanye west an insult to music fans all over the world we he adds possibly using the royal pronoun spend hundreds of pounds to attend glasto and by doing so expect a certain level of entertainment. this level he clarifies in the very angry header to his petition is thus cancel kanye s headline slot and get a rock band. i can only assume that people who get so het up about glastonbury headliners have never actually been there themselves i ve been seven or eight times and i ve only ever seen four headliners one by accident paul mccartney – meh two deliberately stevie wonder – good radiohead – amazing and one allegedly gorillaz – no memory whatsoever of this although there is photographic evidence i was there as clive martin wrote in vice magazine to dismiss glastonbury because of one headliner is like refusing to go to london because you don t like who s playing at the hammersmith apollo.nonetheless people who confuse a general music festival with a music festival that is obliged to reflect my specific taste in music have grumbled about who is playing when at festivals for absolute yonks no documentary of woodstock is complete without reference to the fact that jimi hendrix played at 9am on monday meaning many people had already left and were presumably all tweeting furiously from work about the schedule and bloody hell what was janis joplin doing there and not bob dylan boycottwoodstock but outrage about glastonbury has become something of an annual tradition since 2008 after the infamous – nay historical – controversy over jay-z being booked to headline noel gallagher opined at the time glastonbury has a history of guitar music … i m not having hip-hop at glastonbury it s wrong. the hilariously narcissistic wrongness of gallagher s claim was amusing enough were ub40 the 1983 headliners a guitar band are glastonbury stalwarts the chemical brothers or basement jaxx guitar bands but i was especially intrigued at the time by gallagher s insistence that hip-hop at glastonbury is flat-out wrong an attitude we now see again with the resistance to west no surprise really that glastonbury festival is the whitest place i ve ever been and i ve visited beverly hills to say that a music festival should feature only guitar rock bands which are in the vast main composed of white men as headliners and preclude rap and hip-hop artists who are by and large black is if not an outright racist statement then certainly a race-ish one black headliners are allowed it seems if they have a safe retro appeal stevie wonder or are pure pop beyoncé but god save somerset from any modern black music in the 21st century objections to west at an english music festival feel especially thick-skulled now given his current and very high-profile endorsement of uk grime artists – but coldplay s not grime ergo bad no surprise really that glastonbury festival is the whitest place i ve ever been and i ve visited beverly hills i can count the number of black people i ve ever seen there on one hand – and one of them was stevie wonder it s almost impressive that some people are so determined to maintain this status quo by insisting that the only bands who should headline are those who would feature on a drivetime compilation cd glastonbury doesn t have a history of guitar music it has a history of celebrating the best of modern music so to argue that hip-hop and rap don t have a place there – well good luck with that daddy-o but hey to object to kanye west isn t in itself racist so in the interests of journalistic inquiry i spoke to some of the people who have voiced web-based outrage about what specifically they find so outrageous about one of the biggest music stars on the planet playing at one of the biggest music festivals and here is a summation of my findings 1 he s really arrogant unlike of course that paragon of humility noel we re the biggest thing to come out of england gallagher – or indeed any musician in the world ever who knew that modesty was a requisite for headlining music festivals these days maybe this specific criticism of west should describe him as uppity for clarity s sake 2 he doesn t reflect the spirit of glastonbury unlike of course last year s headliners the famously un-venal and hippie-like rolling stones oh pity the self-appointed guardians of the spirit of glastonbury i love glastonbury but imagine how hard it must be to find an artist who captures the spirit of a festival that now costs £220 a ticket and the most-photographed vip section on earth 3 i just don t like him wahhh so start a music festival in your own garden and invite only people you like look i ve suffered travis coldplay and the sodding verve at glastonbury and i endured but if anyone starts a petition to stop kasabian from existing you know where to find me in the coming year and the results will define the country for a generation these are perilous times over the last three years much of what the guardian holds dear has been threatened – democracy civility truth this us administration is establishing new norms of behaviour anger and cruelty disfigure public discourse and lying is commonplace truth is being chased away but with your help we can continue to put it center stage it will be defining year and we re asking for your help as we prepare for 2020 rampant disinformation partisan news sources and social media s tsunami of fake news is no basis on which to inform the american public in 2020 the need for a robust independent press has never been greater and with your help we can continue to provide fact-based reporting that offers public scrutiny and oversight we are also committed to keeping our journalism open and accessible to everyone and with your help we can keep it that way. america is at a tipping point finely balanced between truth and lies hope and hate civility and nastiness many vital aspects of american public life are in play – the supreme court abortion rights climate policy wealth inequality big tech and much more the stakes could hardly be higher as that choice nears the guardian as it has done for 200 years and with your continued support will continue to argue for the values we hold dear – facts science diversity equality and fairness. – us editor john mulholland on the occasion of its 100th birthday in 1921 the editor of the guardian said perhaps the chief virtue of a newspaper is its independence it should have a soul of its own. that is more true than ever freed from the influence of an owner or shareholders the guardian s robust independence is our unique driving force and guiding principle we also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the guardian in 2019 you provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do we hope to surpass our goal by early january every contribution big or small will help us reach it make a year-end gift from as little as 1 thank you sign in or create

listened to his discography bicycle bicycle bicycle i want to ride my bicycle bicycle bicycle i want to ride my bicycle i want to ride my bike i want to ride my bicycle i want to ride it where i like queen i wan na f k you hard on the sink after that give you somethin to drink step back can t get spunk on the mink bound 2 kanye c mon the tickets cost £225 it s an insult poetry at its finest if anything it s insultingly cheap don t go then she done it with a doctor on a helicopter it s not because kanye is black nor because it s hip-hop it s because he s shit shitness has never prevented previous glastonbury headliners from appearing why s it suddenly an issue now because its niche shit that most of the people that buy tickets don t like he s sold a lot more records recently than some of the other headliners except that hip hop rap r b whatever label you want to put on it is lazy soulless illiterate derivative reactionary bland pap for the radio one generation who probably think the fence collective make sheds ..c mon it s sheeeeeeiiiite trolling for reactions from rap hip hop and r b fams as opposed to glasto stalwart jools holland you mean the butterfly man himself would you pop you one for that there are thousands of acts at thousands of festivals every single year who i wouldn t want to see why do people the majority of whom you d guess won t even be attending glastonbury feel the need to enforce their own tastes/opinions on everyone else this is a pathetic and childish misuse of the petitioning system put the pitchforks away and get a grip of yourselves because it s likely the glastonbury types don t want kanye either whatever a glastonbury type is i m one and i fucking love kanye west well said sean i was with you all the way right up until you dropped the racism bomb if kanye west was white and sang about the shit he sings about hadley would like him about as much as she likes robin thicke if hadley wants to see more black people at glastonbury i would advise to spend less time with the posh white group who decend on the festival from the guardian and get out amongst the masses right up until you dropped the racism bomb unlike of course last year s headliners the famously un-venal and hippie-like rolling stones time really goes slower as you get older that seems like it was at least a year older than that but it must be true because hadley freeman how well i remember her articles on the 1968 moon landings and the wtc attack on 9/12 why would he want to clean the toilets his ego wouln t let him and his talent would not fit him for anything else remember when moral posturing idiots like hadley banged on about how great it was to have jay z at glastonbury because they were white middle class privately educated snobs who were eager to show societ that they were totally with it yah well nobody remembers the performance and those who banged on about it haven t said a word since simply because it was shit well this is de ja vu all over again i was there it was pretty good nothing amazing but then hip hip rarely works well in large open air venue j5 are the only hip hop act i can think of that ive seen really nail it at a large festival https //www.google.fr/search q=rich+hall+kanye+west ie=utf-8 oe=utf-8 gws_rd=cr ei=nagtvehphij1uk_xg5gd enjoy rich halls take on west glastonbury used to be something special now it s just a consumerist hell full of posh twats rozzers and media hacks kanye should be just about right- a classic sleb who s famous for being famous i don t think you can say he s famous for being famous he has output regardless of whether or not you/i/whoever think/s it s any good you can t put him in the same bracket as katie hopkins you keep it real all you want meanwhile the public gets what the public wants hence the festival sells out at £225 a pop kanye west is famous for selling millions of records over a prolonged period of time his wife is famous for being famous £225 i would buy stunk and just watched it on the bbc3 if i can be arsed don t care however i do care enough to comment on the article ok i are less than you care i mean bugger i must care about something then ooh
