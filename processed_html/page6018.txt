Click on your ID - The collections pages will show at the lower part of the page. That's the only way to view your collections. It's an idiotic feature but that's Ebay ---  always shooting itself in the foot. View solution in original post Can't access my Collection either. And when I go to an item there's no collections option anymore. Click on your ID - The collections pages will show at the lower part of the page. That's the only way to view your collections. It's an idiotic feature but that's Ebay ---  always shooting itself in the foot. View solution in original post I’m having some issues there as well - i made a collection and can access it only through its direct link ( http://www.ebay.com/cln/gabzilla79/juicy-charm-world/455705637013 ?) otherwise its as if it doesn’t exist ( https://www.ebay.com/usr/gabzilla79  - notice, “no collections”) Same here. "Add to collection" is missing since ebay updated the UI  I too could not find my Collections for a long time and was seriously frustrated, but I stumbled upon them today! Go to "My Ebay" ... click on "Lists" in the left-hand column (either "All lists" or "Wish list") ... you should see a bright blue box with access to creating a new collection or seeing your old collections.  Good luck! i can't access my collection either... what will i do? If nothing else works it seems like "cln" is an address directive for collections. Try to go directly to the address " http://www.ebay.co.uk/cln/username " If you don't use the ".co.uk" site just substitute with ".com" or whatever. Substitute "username" with your actual username. You will probably have to be logged in first... I noticed I cannot add to my collection any longer.  I used to be able to post a new product, add it to my collection from a link right on the listing.  Now that option is GONE. Why?  Ebay keeps doing **bleep** that makes sellers frustrated and they really don't seem to be giving a **bleep** either.
