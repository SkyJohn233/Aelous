FEEDBACK FROM HAPPY OWNERS: "...WHEN I MET DORA FOR THE FIRST TIME, I FELT I WAS BEING INTRODUCED TO A VERY GIFTED HORSE TRAINER....I COULD TELL BY THE WAY HER HORSES REFLECTED RESPECT  &  LOVE TOWARD HER. I WENT UP TO DORA'S STUD WITH THE HOPE OF BUYING ONE OF HER PRIZED COLTS, ITALIER...IF HE LIKED ME. DORA HAD JUST GREENBROKE HIM A FEW WEEKS PRIOR, AND WHEN I RODE HIM HE WAS SO GENTLE  &  QUIET....NOT ONCE WAS I NERVOUS. NEEDLESS TO SAY, HE IS NOW A HUGE PART OF MY FAMILY.....OUR BLESSED JOURNEY TOGETHER IS BECAUSE OF DORA'S WONDERFUL TRAINING, UNDERTAKEN WITH TRUST, RESPECT, UNDERSTANDING AND LOVE OF HORSES..."
