are within the paper and its supporting information files new polyanionic modifications of polyamide nucleic acid mimics were obtained thymine decamers were synthesized from respective chiral x003b1 and x003b3 -monomers and their enantiomeric purity was assessed here we present the decamer synthesis purification and characterization by maldi-tof mass spectrometry and an investigation of the hybridization properties of the decamers we show that the modified x003b3 s -carboxyethyl-t 10 pna forms a stable triplex with polyadenine dna among the various agents that are capable of antigen- and antisense action 1 artificial biopolymers particularly peptide nucleic acids pnas 2 occupy a special place a structural unit of pnas is the n 2-aminoethyl -glycine aeg fragment with a nucleic heterocyclic base attached via the acetyl linker this structure on the one hand allows an effective recognition of complementary sequences by nucleic bases 3 due to x0201c restrained flexibility x0201d 4 and on the other hand makes aeg -pnas resistant to protease- and nuclease-mediated degradation due to non-natural bonds 5 the properties of aeg -pnas are well studied upon interaction with ss- nucleic acid na targets deoxyribooligonucleotides odns or ribooligonucleotides they form very stable anti-parallel and parallel duplexes 3 and the melting temperatures of the antiparallel duplexes are 10 to 15 x000b0 c higher than those of the parallel duplexes high sequence selectivity has been demonstrated for aeg -pnas bases 3 6 and this selectivity is markedly higher than that found for natural oligonucleotides and their analogues the formation of triplexes between dsdna and aeg -pnas has been described 6 x02013 7 homopyrimidine aeg -pnas are capable of insertion into dsdna with ssdna displacement 7 additionally aeg -pnas are capable of forming g-quadruplexes 8 pnas have already been investigated for more than 20 years and a large number of modifications that increase pna selectivity and affinity for nucleic acid targets or facilitate intracellular pna delivery have been described 9 x02013 11 a number of studies have shown that the x003b1 r configuration 12 x02013 14 x003b2 s 15 and x003b3 s -configurations 16 x02013 23 of the acyclic backbone are beneficial for binding in the latter case accessible chiral agents namely l -amino acids were used as the starting compounds a recent paper 24 describes promising amino- pna derivatives aminomethyl x003b1 and x003b3 -pnas that exhibited high target affinity and selectivity the best results were obtained for x003b3 s -derivatives whereas x003b1 r -derivatives were significantly less efficient and x003b1 -s-derivatives had the lowest efficiency high target affinity has also been reported for oligomers comprising monomers with substituents at both x003b1 and x003b3 positions with coordinated configurations of the chiral centres x003b1 r x003b3 s 25 a number of studies have focused on chiral pnas with guanidine moieties in the side chains 26 good cell membrane permeability has been demonstrated for such pna derivatives and the binding efficiency of the x003b3 s -derivatives 22 27 x02013 28 was superior to that of the x003b1 r -derivatives 28 all of the above-mentioned studies on pna modification have aimed at developing new pna-based molecular tools for fundamental genome studies and broadening the sphere of the practical applications of pnas 29 to solve the problems of self-aggregation and poor solubility two scientific groups have independently proposed phosphono-pnas 30 x02013 32 odn binding affinity and selectivity of phosphono-pnas was inferior to that of aeg -pnas however alternation of phosphono- and aeg monomer units in a pna oligomer resulted in improved binding efficiency 33 further improvements were achieved by the alternation of phosphono monomers and cyclic chiral 1 r 4 rs -hydroxyproline-based monomers 34 thus the incorporation of x0201c stereochemically correct x0201d units generally improved the hybridizing properties of such pnas unlike aeg -pna-synthesis the synthesis of phosphono-pnas is more similar to that of oligonucleotides than to that of peptides 35 the preparation of mixed oligomers with aeg -units is therefore rather complex 36 for various phosphono-pnas derivatives efficient delivery into cells upon complexation with lipofectamine has been demonstrated 37 the same delivery principle has been described for aeg -pnas derivatives with negatively charged peptide tails 38 it has been shown that oligo- l- asp-based fragments conjugated with aeg -pnas are prone to complexation with lipofectamine and the resulting complexes were readily transported into cells 39 a longer the polyasparagine tail is associated with a higher the intracellular delivery efficiency a number of studies have focused on the incorporation of chiral monomers based on dicarboxylic amino acids into aeg -pna oligomers nielsen et al 13 showed that the introduction of thymine x003b1 -monomers based on d -glutamic and l -asparaginic acids into the h-gt x agat x cact x -nh 2 aeg -pna decamer decreased the melting temperatures t m of complexes with native oligonucleotides compared with those of the unmodified pna/dna duplex it has been found that the negatively charged modified decamers demonstrated increased sensitivity to non-complementary nucleosides mismatches in the dna strand x00394 x00422 m perfect duplex x02013 mismatch duplex 20 x000b0 c in a recent study conducted by heemstra et al 40 x003b3 s -carboxymethyl thymine monomers based on l -asp were incorporated into nielsen x02019 s h-gt x agat x cact x -nh 2 aeg -pna decamer 13 the resulting negatively charged pna oligomers formed rather stable complexes with na targets particularly rna at moderate and high salt concentrations additionally aeg -pna with x003b3 s -carboxymethyl thymine monomers exhibited high sensitivity to mismatches in both dna and rna complements 41 in recent years some novel types of negatively charged pnas have been reported the and their charges are represented by n -alkyl-carboxyl groups in the achiral backbone 42 and sulfomethyl groups at the x003b3 -positions 43 x003b3 s -sulfomethyl pnas formed pna 2 dna triplexes and demonstrated good lipofectamine-mediated penetration into skbr3 cells in model experiments it should be noted that all of the previous papers 13 40 42 x02013 43 describe pna oligomers with negatively charged thymine monomers exclusively with at most 3 residues in a chain to summarize the incorporation of negative charges into pna oligomers is required to ensure pna solubility and compatibility with standard cationic lipofection systems whereas for an effective recognition of complementary na sequences the configuration and the positions of chiral centres in the backbone are important it has been shown earlier that more chiral monomers with the x003b3 s configuration is associated with a the higher na binding efficiency 16 23 27 however no previous studies have investigated x003b3 -chiral polyanionic na mimics with a x003b3 s -chiral centre and a negative charge in each structural unit of the oligomer in the present work we outline a synthesis of homothymine polyanionic pnas based on l -glu with chiral centres in the x003b3 s configuration 1 2 and an investigation of their hybridization properties with complementary oligodeoxyriboadenylate d a 10 additionally this work presents the first synthesis of a homothymine polyanionic pna x003b1 -oligomer 3 the synthesis of the starting monomers 4 and 5 fig 1c was performed using previously described methods 44 x02013 45 in which the key pseudopeptide intermediate was obtained via mitsunobu condensation 46 in a recent work we reported the synthesis of monomer 4 via thymine alkylation with a bromoacetoamide precursor 47 an alternative route for the preparation of monomer 5 in which the pseudopeptide intermediate is obtained by reductive n -alkylation was outlined previously 13 the syntheses of some other x003b3 -pna monomers based on dicarboxylic acids and meant for fmoc-protocol oligomerization l -asp 40 and l -glu 48 have also been reported the preparation of a different type of negatively charged x003b3 -pna monomers namely the x003b3 -sulfomethyl pna monomers was described previously 43 the corresponding hydroxymethyl derivatives served as monomer precursors because the stereochemical structure of chiral monomers in pna oligomers impacts pna binding with nucleic acid targets 9 we performed enantiomeric purity tests for the starting monomers 4 and 5 using direct and indirect chromatographic methods the direct approaches for assessing the enantiomeric purity of chiral pna monomers have been described in the literature 48 x02013 49 known indirect approaches include preliminary derivatization of r and s -pnas monomers at the c -termini with subsequent hplc-analysis of the resulting diastereomeric mixtures 12 x02013 13 and derivatization of x003b3 -chiral monomers at the n -termini with mosher reagents 23 x02013 24 27 with subsequent analysis of the diastereomeric mixtures by 19 f-nmr spectroscopy the latter indirect approach was recently used for determining the enantiomeric purity of x003b1 monomers 24 and the purity was shown to be sufficient for subsequent oligomerization thus according to the literature x003b1 and x003b3 monomers do not racemize upon n -terminal derivatization the direct approach used in the present work involves the synthesis of two enantiomers in our case one from l -glu x003b3 s 4a and one from d -glu x003b3 r 4b 44 the selection of the optimal conditions for their separation on a column with a chiral sorbent and the estimation of the enantiomeric purity in a selected system for hplc separation of the 4a/4b mixture a hybrid sorbent silica gel with immobilized eremomycin was chosen this chiral selector has been reported to possess good enantio-selectivity toward modified x003b1 and x003b2 -amino acids and their derivatives 50 x02013 51 the separation of the s and r -monomers 4a and 4b was relatively efficient under the selected conditions fig 2a the target x003b3 s- thymine monomer 4a was analysed in this system fig 2b and its enantiomeric purity was estimated to be x0003e 99 the same method was employed to assess the enantiomeric purity of the x003b1 s -monomer 5b fig 2c and 2d the results of the direct method are shown in fig 2b and 2d peak area calculations indicated that the enantiomeric purity of 5b was x0003e 99 according to the results of the direct tests both the x003b1 and x003b3 monomers have sufficient enantiomeric purity and can be used for solid-phase oligomerization without further purification the significant broadening and asymmetry of the hplc peaks observed upon separation of the enantiomer mixtures 4a/4b and 5a/5b may be due to the existence of each enantiomer in solution as two constrained conformers fig 1c to reliably exclude the presence of substantial enantiomeric impurities we performed additional indirect tests with monomers 4 and 5 for these tests c -terminal diastereomers were obtained the enantiomers 4a/4b and 5a/5b were derivatized with the asymmetric reagent l -ileome 6 s1 scheme in the presence of n -ethyl- n x02019 3-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide edc and 3-hydroxy-1,2,3-benzotriazine-4-on dhbtoh to yield the respective diastereomers 7a/7b and 8a/8b fig 3 the diastereomer structures were confirmed by 1 h- and 13 c-nmr and elemental analysis elution systems for reverse-phase hplc separation of the diastereomer pairs 7a/7b and 8a/8b fig 3a and 3c respectively were selected the enantiomeric purities of the target diastereomers 7a and 8a fig 3b and 3d respectively were estimated under the selected conditions importantly no significant peak broadening was observed although we were unable to find a system for the complete separation of the diastereomers 7a and 7b the system with heptane/isopropanol 88:12 provided the best separation the enantiomeric purity of the target ss -diastereomer 7a in this system was approximately 98 the hplc analysis of 8 a revealed that the portions of the ss and rs -diastereomers were approximately 90.1 and 9.9 respectively which agrees with the results of previous studies 13 the results of the indirect enantiomeric purity test correlate well with those of the direct test only in the case of the x003b3 -monomer 4 but certain racemization may have occurred upon c -terminal derivatization of the x003b1 -monomer 5 to prevent good correlation between the two tests it can be concluded that the direct tests are more accurate and adequate it is known that x003b1 -pna monomers have a tendency to racemize upon activation of the c -terminal carboxyl group 52 in this respect these monomers are not good substrates for oligomerization in the case of x003b3 -monomers on the contrary racemization has never been observed under standard pna synthesis conditions 53 thus according to our data and the data reported by other groups x003b3 -monomers do not exhibit a tendency to racemize in indirect tests upon derivatization at both the n and c -termini and are stereochemically more stable than x003b1 -derivatives the reproducibility of the results of direct and indirect tests for the x003b3 -monomer 4 confirms this conclusion monomer 4 was used for the synthesis of oligomers 1 and 2 monomer 5 was used for the synthesis of oligomer 3 solid-phase oligomerization was performed using a modified version of a previously published boc-protocol for the preparation of aeg -pnas 53 the resin load of 0.1 x02013 0.2 mmol nh 2 -/g the condensation reagent hbtu the boc-cleavage mixture tfa with 5 m -cresol and the mixture used for oligomer cleavage from the polymer support were in accordance with the classical protocol the modifications of the protocol were as follows capping of the amino groups was performed by treatment with ac 2 o instead of rapoport 's reagent 54 3 instead of 5 equivalents of the monomer were used at each condensation step the resin was washed with dmf/dcm instead of py and the coupling time was extended from 10 x02013 15 minutes to 2 hours the thymine oligomer 1 was synthesized on a mbha-resin using the manual device for solid-phase peptide synthesis s2 scheme final deblocking and cleavage of decamer 1 from the polymeric support were performed by the standard x000ab low-high x000bb tfoh method 55 which includes treating the loaded resin with solutions of various trifluoromethanesulfonic acid tfoh contents for 1 hour at 0 x000b0 c the x000ab low x000bb solution a tfa x02212 m -cresol dms tfoh 11:2:6:1 v/v/v/v the x000ab high x000bb solution b tfoh tfa m -cresol 1:8:1 v/v/v the yield of decamer 1 was 0.7 the yield of decamer 2 was too low under such conditions therefore we introduced several changes into the standard protocol a glycine spacer between the resin and the growing pna chain was used in the case of decamer 2 the deblocking and cleavage of decamer 2 from the support were performed by a previously described method 47 the resin was pre-cooled to -30 x000b0 c and then treated with a mixture containing triisopropylsilane tis x02014 tfa tfoh tis 3:1:0.1 v/v/v x02014 for 1 h at 0 x000b0 c. decamer 2 was obtained at a yield of 5.4 the x003b1 -decamer 3 was obtained as a reference oligomer different methods were employed for its deblocking and cleavage resin treatment with x0201c low x0201d and x0201c high x0201d tfoh solutions for 1 h at 0 x000b0 c resulted in complete degradation of the target oligomer according to maldi-ms data decreasing the deblocking and cleavage times from 1 hour to 15 and 20 minutes respectively allowed us to obtain decamer 3 at a yield of 0.2 but incomplete cleavage from the support under such conditions is very likely resin treatment with a mixture containing triethylsilane tes x02014 tfa tfoh tes 3:1:0.1 v/v/v x02014 56 lead to an insignificant increase in the yield of decamer 3 0.9 the maximum yield 2.3 was obtained upon cleavage with the tfa tfoh tis mixture 3:1:0.1 v/v/v 1 hr 0 x000b0 c 47 oligomers 1 2 and 3 were purified by reverse-phase hplc and their structures were confirmed by maldi-ms s1 s2 and s3 figs because the starting x003b3 -monomer 4 is stereochemically more stable its oligomerization results in optically pure products whereas in the case of the x003b1 x02013 monomer 5 partial racemization during the solid-phase synthesis is possible to overcome this general problem of x003b1 -pna derivatives a sub-monomeric approach has been proposed 57 x02013 58 in this approach carboxymethylated derivatives of the heterocycles are condensed with the pseudopeptide derivative immobilized on the solid phase unfortunately this approach is inapplicable in the case of l -glu-based monomers 4 and 5 monomolecular cyclization of the pseudopeptides would primarily occur instead of the acylation of the secondary amino groups in the respective pseudopeptides with the carboxymethylated heterocycles 59 in the early studies on the preparation of x003b1 -oligomers which preceded the emergence of the sub-monomeric approach the enantiomeric purity of the original monomers x003b1 s and x003b1 r was 90 according to the results of c -terminal derivatization tests 13 despite the relatively low purity of the monomers those studies convincingly demonstrated that the configuration of the chiral centres determines the hybridization properties of x003b1 -oligomers to a significant extent thus x003b3 -derivatives are preferable to x003b1 -analogues in terms of the solid-phase synthesis efficiency and the stereochemical stability of the oligomers the hybridization properties of x003b3 and x003b1 -thymine pna decamers 1 and 3 were studied by physicochemical methods natural oligonucleotides that were complementary da 10 and isosequential t 10 to x003b1 and x003b3 pnas were obtained their synthesis purification and maldi-ms analysis were performed as described previously 60 the thermal difference spectra tds from the subtraction of the 15 x000b0 c spectrum from the 90 x000b0 c spectrum cd spectra and uv-melting profiles of the pna/dna complexes fig 4 were compared with those of the isosequential dna duplex dt 10 /da 10 the tds data fig 4a suggested that x003b3 -pna 1 may form either a duplex with increased stability high tds amplitude at 260 nm or a triplex with da 10 but the x003b1 -pna 3 /da 10 complex if present was relatively unstable the tds curve shapes of both x003b3 -pna 1 /da 10 and x003b1 -pna 3 /da 10 were rather similar to that of the dna duplex however the slight bathochromic shift indicates the presence of pna 2 da 10 triplexes 61 the uv-melting data fig 4b also indicate the formation of an extremely stable x003b3 -pna/da 10 complex t m x003b3 -pna/da10 x0003e 80 x000b0 c t m dt10/da10 25 x000b1 1 x000b0 c 62 the melting profile of x003b1 -pna/da 10 bears no resemblance to a sigma curve which may be due to the presence of high-order pna/dna structures their non-cooperative melting or pna self-aggregation decreasing the pna/dna or salt concentration up to 5 fold did not change the shape of the x003b1 -pna/da 10 melting profile therefore it is unlikely that the complex is extremely stable the cd spectra of the single-stranded pnas fig 4c are relatively similar to that of dt 10 in the 244 x02013 300 nm wavelength range with the exception of having a decreased amplitude and presenting a hypochromic shift of a negative band cd spectra of the pna/da 10 complexes fig 4c are substantially different from that of dt 10 /da 10 suggesting large differences in geometry or stoichiometry we prepared a j-plot to clarify the stoichiometry of the x003b3 ce -h- t 10 -gly-nh 2 2 /da 10 complex as shown in fig 5a 5b and 5c according to the j-plot results the pna dna ratio in this extremely stable complex is in the range of 65:35 to 70:30 therefore the complex appears to be a pna dna pna triplex this finding agrees with the shape of the cd spectrum of x003b3 -pna 2 da 10 fig 5d because the negative band at approximately 210 nm is characteristic of triple helices 63 the formation of the x003b3 -pna 2 da 10 triplex agrees with the data presented in the literature analogous pna 2 dna triplexes have been reported for homopyrimidine aeg -pna 6 and homothymine chimeric phosphono-pnas/ aeg -pnas 33 in a recent paper on homopyrimidine decamers containing aeg -monomers and thymine monomers with a sulfomethyl substituent at the x003b3 -position similar triplexes has also been described 43 the relative orientation of the pna strands in such complexes has not been unambiguously demonstrated in dna homopyrimidine 2 homopurine triplexes 64 the homopyrimidine strands are antiparallel we hypothesize that this also is likely the case with our x003b3 -pna 2 da10 triplex considering its remarkable stability a higher stability is characteristic of pna 2 dna triplexes that have the watson x02013 crick pna strand in the antiparallel orientation and the hoogsteen strand in the parallel orientation to the dna strand 65 the sequence-specificity of triplex formation which is the key aspect in the context of antigen action was studied the sensitivity of our x003b3 -pna decamer to mismatches in a target odn s4 fig appears to be at least comparable with the sensitivities of homothymine aeg-pna 6 and homothymine chimeric phosphono-pna 33 although we were unable to estimate the sensitivity of x003b3 -pna accurately because of the extreme stability of the x003b3 -pna 2 da 10 triplex even at relatively low ionic strength its t m was x0003e 80 x000b0 c the stability of our x003b3 ce -t 10 -pnas 2 d a 10 triplex is close to that described for aeg -pnas 6 which suggests that carboxymethyl groups in a fully charged x003b3 -oligomer do not hamper binding with an odn target at the same time these negatively charged groups ensure pna compatibility with the conditions required for targeting genomic dna in culture and potentially in vivo i.e. for pna-mediated genome editing 66 x02013 68 or for gene expression regulation 69 x02013 70 while unmodified aeg -pnas bind dna most efficiently at low salt concentrations 71 the new polyanionic pnas work well at both moderate and low ionic strength this study demonstrates the first synthesis of three l -glu-based polyanionic nucleic acid mimics the steric structures of the new pna oligomers were predetermined using chiral x003b1 and x003b3 -monomers the synthesis and purification of the polyanionic pnas as well as their physicochemical characteristics particularly their hybridization affinities toward complementary dna were described for x003b1 and x003b3 -thymine decamers the results of the hybridization studies suggest that x003b1 ce -t 10 -pnas are not prone to forming stable complexes with dna and that x003b3 ce -t 10 -pnas can form triplexes with high thermodynamic stability similarly to classical aeg -pnas 6 our findings indicate the advantages of x003b3 ce -pnas over x003b1 ce -pnas with respect to complexation with dna efficiency of solid-phase synthesis and stereochemical purity of the oligomers importantly our results also suggest that the preorganization of the pna backbone which is dependent on the positions and configurations of the chiral centres may be more significant for molecular recognition than the presence of charged side residues in conclusion it should be noted that further studies of the negatively charged pnas would require optimization of the solid-phase synthetic protocols for a more detailed analysis of such compounds mixed-sequence
