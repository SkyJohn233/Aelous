ᴅʀᴀɢᴏɴ ʙᴀʟʟ sᴜᴘᴇʀ ʙʀᴏʟʏ wiki anime amino ᴅʀᴀɢᴏɴ ʙᴀʟʟ sᴜᴘᴇʀ ʙʀᴏʟʏ i am pretty sure that dragon ball needs no introduction it is one of the grandfathers of anime i love this franchise because it was probably my first ever anime ever alongside with pokemon and both of these franchises are always going to be extremely close to my heart so it is no surprise that i was super hyped for the dragon ball super broly movie also because broly is one of my favourite characters from dragon ball despite having my expectations quite high which usually is n't good for a movie by the end of it i was satisfied with what i saw •────────✧────────• sᴛᴏʀʏ the movie starts off by showing us the backstory of our four main characters that would later on shape the entire dragon ball franchise they are of course goku vegeta frieza and broly at the very beginning we see frieza reduce the saiyan race that once conquered planets of the universe to slavery now all of them must obey frieza 's commends and find new planets for him to conquer that is when three saiyans were born broly vegeta and goku vegeta is the prince of all saiyans and is born with incredible power and potential so his father the king saw in him the saviour that would destroy frieza 's empire and free the saiyan race however around the same time broly was also born and the power and potential he had far surpassed vegeta 's the king could n't accept that because of his pride so he described broly as a monster that represents danger for his people and he sends broly to an unknown planet with very limited resources broly 's father paragus swears to get his revenge on the king and leaves to protect his child on the unknown planet paragus and broly are stranded due to the spacecraft breaking down they then started living on their own on the planet for decades to come and paragus trained broly to fight like warrior to get his revenge whilst they lived on the unknown planet a few years later on the saiyan 's planet frieza reunites all the saiyans to obliterate them as he senses something in them that was a possible threat which could eventually bring his galactic empire down and boy he was so right however bardock senses that something was not right so he immediately saves his son goku who was very weak when he was born by sending him to another planet earth whilst prince vegeta was saved because he was a spoiled brat that did n't follow the orders to reunite on their planet instead he was having fun with his friends on another planet after finishing the backstory we proceed to the present when just after the end of the tournament of power frieza is revived and he wants to pay earth a visit to make a wish he wants to grow a bit taller whilst heading for earth he comes to know about two saiyans who were found stranded on an unknown planet by two scouts of the frieza force after hearing their backstory from paragus frieza decides to have a little fun by taking them to earth and making broly fight against goku and vegeta when both of them already mastered the super saiyan blue once they reach earth the uninterrupted battle sequence finally starts that lasts till the end of the movie •────────✧────────• characters the entire movie centres around our four main characters as i said before not much screen time is given to other characters though the few minutes bardock had were really amazing for me and also the backstory in general felt a lot more complete than the previous dragon ball movies with broly where they did n't actually give us any explanations behind his rage which made it harder to get attached to broly as a character in this movie on the other hand they tried to fix their mistakes by giving broly a proper tragic sad story by not only making him subjected to the injustice of king vegeta but also by making him the pawn of his father 's disgusting game of revenge by training him to become a warrior against his own will however what really made me empathise with broly is when we get to know about his first friend the very first and the only friend broly ever made was a giant green creature they would fight together and have fun together but his father hated that creature so he blasted it with an energy beam that tore one of its ears off after that day broly never saw his friend again this is how a sweet little boy got turned into a killing machine by his own father usually dragon ball movies never bother to give their characters a backstory since the majority of the audience is already familiar with the characters and are there only for the action yet seeing them put some effort into changing that tradition of theirs really made me feel good goku and vegeta on the other hand were simply goku and vegeta nothing more nothing less though i loved to see a new side to frieza when he revealed that he wants to gather the dragon balls to grow a few inches it really made me laugh •────────✧────────• aɴɪᴍᴀᴛɪᴏɴ aɴᴅ mᴜรɪᴄ it is dragon ball we are talking about so obviously the budget is off the charts the action sequences were incredible never has dragon ball looked so great everything from the fight choreography to the flawless execution the amount of camera movements and the camera angles used definitely made the action lot more immersive also another thing i appreciate a lot is that they put a lot of effort into something as simple as a super saiyan transformation making it seem a lot more epic the music only amplifies the hype and offers what is half an hour of pure action with countless power ups fusion techniques lots of loud shouting and energy blasts and everything that dragon ball is so famous for •────────✧────────• pᴇʀsᴏɴᴀʟ tʜᴏᴜɢʜᴛs for me this movie was a reminder of everything i love about dragon ball and more thanks to this movie i think the character of broly gained the recognition he deserved and became one of my favourite characters of the dragon ball franchise though i wish the movie was a little bit longer since at times the pacing seemed to be a little too fast and towards the end the way they rushed everything to wrap things up i think they had the possibility to do a lot better with the ending other than that i have to say there is n't much that i disliked so taking everything into consideration the story characters animation and music and my personal enjoyment of it i rate this movie a solid 7.5/10 i think every dragon ball fan should definitely check it out they will absolutely love it though i think for non dragon ball fans this is not the movie to watch to enter into the franchise as it requires a basic understanding of saiyans and dragon ball universe •────────✧────────• thanks everyone for reading i hope you enjoy it i would like to thank my friend cili here for
