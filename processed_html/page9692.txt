We present a differential analysis for the Test for Body Image Distortion in Children and Adolescents (BID-CA, German:TEK-KJ) using a large child and adolescents sample, including for the first time male participants. We analyze convergent validity with the Contour Drawing RatingScale (CDRS) as well as differences between children and adolescents fromdifferent type of schools and different BMI percentile groups. The sample sizewas N = 1,654 pupils (873 females and 781 males) with an average age of 13.35years (SD = 0.76). We calculated a substantial convergent validity with the CDRS.Significant differences between children and adolescents from different type ofschools and different BMI percentile groups were detected, with increased values for children and adolescents attending high school and underweight participants. The TEK-KJ seems to be an appropriate additional instrument for detecting thehaptic-perceptive component of body-image distortion. The normative datapresented improves the standardization of this instrument. ><
