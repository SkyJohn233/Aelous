First, it doesn &# x27;t allow spaces (Maybe this is something with Canada &# x27;s plates? I don &# x27;t know.)  Second, it doesn &# x27;t allow for anything other than the Ontario plates.  Should really try to update it with more plates, especially classic plates. PC 1 5 User Rating: 1 out of 5 No choices of states or provinces or anything. Thumbs down!
