foot if you ve been sedentary for over a year check with your doctor before you start a running program while your doctor will most likely support a new exercise habit he or she may offer some advice and precautions also if you ve had an injury if you take medication or if you manage a medical condition ask if there are special guidelines you should follow for example people with diabetes may want to carry a snack 3 ﻿ those who take certain blood pressure medications may need to use methods other than a heart rate watch to monitor intensity wear a pair of running shoes that fit comfortably and are the right type of shoes for your foot and running style visit a specialty running store to get fitted for the best shoes for you while you are there you might want to check out technical gear such as running shorts tops or tights that are made out of lightweight wicking fibers while these garments aren t necessary for running they help you to stay dry and comfortable when you work out take measured steps to keep your body safe and free from injury first also do a warm up before you start running walk or do an easy jog for 5 to 10 minutes before increasing your intensity you might also add warm-up exercises such as dynamic stretches or running drills then make sure you follow running safety advice such as going against traffic when running on roads you should also always remember to carry an id when you head out for a run so that you can be identified quickly in the unlikely event of an accident you can start your running program by combining your runs with intervals of walking for many new runners this is the easiest way to build endurance with less stress on the joints and a manageable intensity level simply start with one minute of running and one minute of walking and then try to increase the running intervals as you become more comfortable make the switch to all running your running workouts might be challenging in the beginning but they shouldn t be so hard that you never want to run again during each workout keep a comfortable conversational pace if you can t speak in full sentences slow down if you re running alone try talking to yourself breathe in through your nose and mouth so you can get the most amount of oxygen try doing deep belly breathing to avoid side stitches or cramps 4 ﻿ after each run cool down by doing some easy jogging or walking some gentle stretching after will help you avoid tight muscles aim for consistency in your new running program rather than speed or distance establish a weekly running schedule to get into a regular running habit running is a natural movement but that doesn t mean that you can t improve certain aspects of your running form to improve your experience proper running form can help you become a more efficient runner you can learn to conserve energy improve your pace run longer distances and reduce your risk of injury by paying attention to and tweaking different elements of your running mechanics there are a few basic form rules to follow keep your posture upright your head should be lifted your back should feel long and tall and shoulders level but relaxed maintain a neutral pelvis make sure you re not leaning forward or back at your waist which some runners do as they get tired as you run longer distances be especially mindful of your shoulder placement they may start to hunch over rounding the shoulders too far forward tends to tighten the chest and restrict breathing it helps to look ahead focus your eyes on the ground about 10 to 20 feet in front of you your arms should swing naturally back and forth from the shoulder joint rather than your elbow joint there should be a 90-degree bend at the elbow in the proper position your hand should almost graze your hip as it moves back and forth your hands should stay as relaxed as possible you can gently cup your hands or simply let them relax just don t clench them into fists because it can lead to tension in your arms shoulders and neck the way that your foot hits the pavement is called your footstrike there are different ways that your foot may approach the road you might land on your heel on the middle of your foot or on the toes or forefoot front of the foot don t be a toe runner or a heel-striker if you land on your toes your calves will get tight and you ll fatigue quickly you may also develop shin pain landing on your heels is not a good option either it usually means you are overstriding—taking steps that are longer than they need to be this wastes energy and may cause injury try to land on the middle of your foot and then roll through to the front of your toes you ll learn quickly that eating right and staying hydrated can make or break your runs you lose water through sweat whether it s cold or hot out so you need to drink before during and after your runs when running you should pay attention to your thirst level and drink when you feel thirsty if you re looking for a general rule of thumb for fluid consumption during your runs you should take in four to six ounces of fluid every 20 minutes during your runs runners running faster than eight-minute miles should drink six to eight ounces every 20 minutes here are some specific tips for longer runs or races what you eat before during and after a run has a big effect on your performance and recovery keep in mind however that while running does burn a lot of calories it certainly doesn t give you license to eat anything you want some new runners learn this the hard way when they actually gain weight after a couple of

stay energized especially on long runs however keep in mind that using headphones during runs comes with a few pros and cons it might be helpful to do some runs with headphones and some without you

work that you ve put in on the days when you don t feel motivated simply look at all that you ve accomplished and you might get the energy to exercise lastly fill your home workspace or social media feed with motivational running quotes simply surrounding yourself with the words of talented runners can be both uplifting and inspiring while we d all wish for perfect cool running weather all year-long we know that there will be plenty of times when the weather conditions will be less than ideal for running here are some recommendations for staying safe in all weather conditions if you run all year long plan to do a few cold weather runs dress in layers start with a thin layer of synthetic material such as polypropylene which wicks sweat from your body stay away from cotton because it holds the moisture and will keep you wet an outer breathable layer of nylon or gore-tex will help protect you against wind and precipitation while still letting out heat and moisture to prevent overheating and chilling if it s really cold out you ll need a middle layer such as polar fleece for added insulation cover your head and extremities wearing a hat will help prevent heat loss so your circulatory system will have more heat to distribute to the rest of the body wear gloves or mittens on your hands and warm socks on your feet don t overdress you re going to warm up once you get moving so you should feel a little bit chilly when you start your run if you re warm and comfortable when you first start you re going to start sweating very early in your run a good rule of thumb is to dress as if it s 20 degrees warmer outside than it really is it s likely that many of your runs will take place in warm weather here are the best tips to stay safe in the heat light loose gear light-colored loose-fitting clothing will help your body breathe and cool itself down naturally tight clothing restricts that process and dark colors absorb the sun s light and heat wear synthetic fabrics not cotton because they will wick moisture away from your skin so cooling evaporation can occur if you want to wear something on your head to block the sun wear a visor a hat is too constrictive and traps heat use water in and on your body in addition to drinking water when thirsty you can use water to cool yourself during runs if you re overheating splashing water on your head and body will cool you down quickly and have a lasting effect as the water evaporates from your skin good spots to splash cold water are your head back of your neck and under your arms don t push your pace on a race day or during an intense workout take the weather conditions into account hot and humid conditions are not the time to try to push your pace don t try to beat the heat slow down take walking breaks and save your hard efforts for cooler weather if the conditions are really brutal do some treadmill running if that s an option believe it or not your running program should include more than just running it s a good idea to mix other activities into your training regimen cross-training helps to balance different muscle groups prevent overuse injuries and mix up your workout routine so that you don t get bored cycling swimming deep water running skating or using an elliptical trainer are all complementary aerobic exercises that will help you avoid getting burned out strength-training one to two times a week can also help with injury prevention 6 ﻿ once you ve established your running program you might become interested in participating in a running event there are different types of running events running races are timed events where you usually wear a bib number and a timing chip the chip records your time when you cross the starting line and the finish line results are usually posted after the race and top runners overall and in age categories often win a prize fun runs are often charity runs or runs organized to celebrate a common cause or raise money for a charity you might wear a bib number when you participate in a fun run but you don t wear a timing chip these runs encourage participation but not necessarily competition fun runs are generally 5ks or shorter there are different distances for running events these are the most common a 5k race is five kilometers or 3.1 miles in length while these races are shorter they don t necessarily have to be easier many seasoned runners participate in these events and compete at a very fast pace but because the distance is shorter this is also a great race for a beginner runner a 10k is 10 kilometers in length or 6.2 miles long these mid-distance events offer the opportunity to challenge your ability to run fast and run a little bit farther once you ve run a 5k comfortably a 10k is a reasonable next step ten-mile races have become more popular as half marathons around the country are filling up sooner a 10-miler further challenges your ability to run longer distances and requires you to manage your pace for an extended period of time this type of event is challenging but do-able for runners who have conquered 5k and 10k events the half marathon is just a slight bump up from a 10-mile race but many runners find that small bump to be quite a challenge a half-marathon requires substantial training and a smart organized plan very few runners can complete a half marathon with little to no training even if they include walking the marathon used to be the ultimate running experience reserved solely for seasoned runners who could compete at a moderate to fast pace however marathons around the country now welcome runners and walkers of varying abilities if you are interested in participating in a marathon check the time cut-off and qualification standards as not all marathons are a good fit for all runners if you ve competed in races of varying distances and you still need a greater challenge consider the ultramarathon these grueling races often cover 50 miles or more sometimes up to 100 miles and many take place in challenging heat and terrains these events not only take serious training but sometimes also require you to enlist the help of support
