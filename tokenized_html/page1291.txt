sexism in schools sciencedirect sciencedirect sexism is gender-based prejudice or discrimination as with other forms of prejudice and discrimination it functions to maintain status and power differences between groups in society one manifestation of sexism involves prejudice and discrimination against girls and women who seek to achieve in prestigious fields traditionally associated with males another manifestation of sexism however occurs when pressures are placed on boys and men to conform to traditional conceptions of masculinity over the last two decades an increasing number of developmental and educational psychologists have become concerned about sexism directed toward children and adolescents in school contexts our chapter reviews the research on this topic after providing an overview of different processes related to sexism we examine how it is manifested in school contexts sexism is seen through gender-stereotyped biases against girls and boys in academic and athletic achievement also it occurs through sexual harassment in social interactions we also address factors related to children x27 s awareness of sexism and coping responses to sexism finally we consider possible ways to reduce sexism and foster effective coping in schools the constructs known as stereotypes attitudes prejudice and discrimination are interrelated the term stereotypes refers to particular attributes believed to characterize a group e.g. girls play with dolls the term attitudes refers to the positive or negative emotional associations between particular attributes and groups more specifically a proscriptive attitude refers to an attribute that the perceiver believes a group should exhibit e.g. girls should play with dolls whereas a prescriptive attitude refers to an attribute that the perceiver considers that members of a group should avoid e.g. boys should not play with dolls prejudice occurs when the perceiver evaluates other persons based on their own stereotypes and attitudes e.g. negative perception of boys who play with dolls discrimination is the behavioral expression of prejudice e.g. bullying a boy who plays with dolls when prejudice and discrimination are based on a person x27 s gender it constitutes sexism analogous bias against sexual minorities is known as heterosexism there are two distinct but related types of sexism according to glick and fiske x27 s 1996 ambivalent sexism model gender-based prejudice is ambivalent because there are asymmetries in status and power between men and women yet there is maleâ€“female interdependence within families and heterosexual relationships in the model sexism can include both hostile and benevolent types hostile sexism refers to negative attitudes toward individuals who violate traditional gender stereotypes for example as in the previous example teasing a boy who plays with dolls is an expression of hostile sexism in contrast benevolent sexism includes protective paternalism i.e. belief that men must protect women and complementary gender differentiation i.e. belief that women and men are different and complement one another for example classrooms that teach boys and girls very differently based on presumed gender differences often express benevolent sexism although benevolent sexism is often more attractive to women and men than hostile sexism both reinforce traditional gender roles and status imbalances researchers studying social cognition based on a dual-process model of cognition have illustrated that stereotypes attitudes and prejudices can operate at both conscious or explicit and unconscious or implicit levels e.g. greenwald et al. 2002 conscious or explicit stereotyped attitudes are reflected in the views that individuals deliberately express to others for example a child might observe a boy playing with a doll and state only girls can play with dolls. unconscious or implicit stereotyped attitudes are seen when individuals respond automatically in situations based on conditioned semantic and emotional associations to particular social categories these automatic responses sometimes differ from the conscious or explicit beliefs that children and adults hold greenwald et al. 2002 two kinds of sexism occurring in school contexts are addressed in this chapter first gender biases are sometimes reflected in differential expectations for girls and boys in overall school success particular academic subjects or athletics these biases can affect children s developing beliefs motives and abilities second sexual harassment is another form of sexism that affects many students in schools it refers to inappropriate or hostile sexual behaviors that occur in face-to-face interactions e.g. sexual teasing unwanted touching or through the use of online social media with both types of sexism children s achievement and well-being can be affected both directly and indirectly direct influences occur when institutions adults and peers encourage or discourage particular behaviors based on children s gender indirect influences occur when children internalize gender-stereotyped expectations and thereby avoid practicing particular behaviors or achieving in particular domains they see as contrary to their gender ideology sexism is sometimes experienced differently based on the individual x27 s ethnicity or race as explicated in feminist standpoint theory ethnicity/race intersect with gender in complicated ways basow and rubin 1999 stewart and mcdermott 2004 barbarin chinn and wright 2014 chapter 10 of this volume and rowley et al 2014 chapter 9 of this volume address this complexity by highlighting the unique experiences of african american boys within and outside of school contexts this intersection can impact sexism within schools in at least three related ways one issue is that children from different ethnic/racial groups may be differentially knowledgeable about and sensitive to sexism in some situations both boys and girls from minority ethnic/racial groups such as african americans latino/a americans and asian americans are more sensitive to all forms of discrimination and therefore are more likely than white european american children to recognize sexism see kane 2000 however at times the opposite trend seems to occur that is gender bias is most salient to white european american children because gender is their primary social identity brown et al. 2011 turner and brown 2007 a second issue related to ethnicity/race is that gender is sometimes constructed differently in certain cultural contexts for example gender-typing pressures tend to be more traditional among latino children compared to white european american children e.g. azmitia brown 2000 furthermore among adolescents many latinas have distinct conceptions of feminism in which they combine cultural ideals of marianismo e.g. hurtado 2003 with notions of gender equality manago brown leaper 2009 in contrast gender typing tends to be less traditional among african american children than among european american children see kane 2000 finally ethnicity and race are associated with their own academic stigmas and achievement gaps for example throughout elementary school latino students perform worse on average in math and reading and are more likely to perform below grade level than their european american counterparts e.g. lee bowen 2006 these types of ethnic achievement gaps can exacerbate or mitigate gender-based achievement gaps e.g. gender gaps in math achievement are highest for european american students and nonexistent among african american students mcgraw lubienski strutchens 2006 thus any discussion of sexism within schools should acknowledge that sexism occurs within a particular ethnic/racial context and does not impact all children in the same way sexism can be perpetuated in schools directly and indirectly within the classroom teachers can express implicit and explicit sexist attitudes and show differential treatment of boys and girls e.g. tiedemann 2000 within hallways and other public spaces in schools peers can perpetrate sexism by harassing and rejecting the target of their gender bias sexism can also be perpetuated in schools indirectly parents are influential in shaping the academic attitudes that children bring to school e.g. frome and eccles 1998 herbert and stipek 2005 popular media consumed by most children is also a powerful source of sexism through its pervasive reinforcement of gender stereotypes signorielli 2012 once children begin school teachers may perpetuate sexism in various ways studies from the 1990s found that some teachers hold sexist attitudes about children x27 s abilities and interests some teachers for example were more likely to perceive boys than girls as logical competitive liking math independent in math and needing math and were more likely to attribute boys success in math to ability but attribute girls success to effort fennema et al. 1990 jackson and leffingwell 1999 li 1999 tiedemann 2000 these implicit and explicit biases can affect teacher x27 s expectations for their students and research has consistently shown that expectations about students abilities can be self-fulfilling jussim harber 2005 the same era of research revealed that in some studies teachers treated boys and girls differently in the classroom such as favoring boys over girls when calling on students asking students to explain their answers and giving repeated explanations in science and math classes american association of university women aauw 1992 jackson and leffingwell 1999 when girls did get attention it could be contradictory they may have received criticism for the content of work completed yet praise for the neatness and timeliness of the work aauw 1992 perhaps because of this differential treatment teachers gender stereotypes are reflected in students gender stereotypes keller 2001 more recent research has shown that many teachers try to be egalitarian in their explicit beliefs garrahy 2001 jones and myhill 2004 teachers often rate boys and girls similarly on math competencies which is consistent with boys and girls actual performance helwig et al. 2001 herbert and stipek 2005 researchers have observed patterns that are opposite to those seen in earlier studies that is some teachers now evaluate girls higher than boys in math competence when they are aware of students genderâ€”but not when they are blind to students gender lavy 2008 conversely some teachers perceive boys as more likely to be underachievers and troublemakers compared to girls jones myhill 2004 this difference is particularly pronounced for african american boys and girls wood kaplan mcloyd 2007 yet even when teachers perceive gender similarities in overall academic competence they often assume that boys and girls have different learning styles and interests skelton et al. 2009 current research focuses on how teachers implicit gender biases may influence children within the classroom an example of a how implicit sexism can affect children is the finding that female teachers own math anxiety is associated with an increase in girls endorsing the stereotype that boys are good at math and girls are good at reading beilock gunderson ramirez levine 2010 this in turn is associated with girls lower math performance beilock et al. 2010 although the exact mechanism of influence is unclear some female teachers may model these stereotypes through their own nonverbal behavior see lane 2012 petersen and hyde 2014 chapter 2 of this volume peers can also be sources of sexism at school for children and adolescents although peer-directed sexism can be important across all school years the impact of peers is particularly influential during middle school brown larson 2009 most frequently peers express sexism through perpetrating sexual harassment toward classmates and through rejecting or teasing gender-atypical classmates as will be described below peers are the most frequent perpetrators of sexual harassment fineran bennett 1999 furthermore because sexual harassment typically occurs in public often in school hallways and classrooms harris interactive 2001 timmerman 2005 peers have the opportunity to reinforce and regulate these behaviors indeed adolescents indicate that sexual harassment is both implicitly condoned and explicitly encouraged by peers about 54 of adolescents admit to perpetrating sexual harassment against a peer harris interactive 2001 of those students a majority stated that they sexually harassed a peer because a lot of people do it reported by 39 of perpetrators or their friends encouraged them reported by 24 of perpetrators harris interactive 2001 peer norms about the acceptability of sexual harassment are a strong predictor of an individual x27 s own sexually harassing behavior jewell brown 2013 in addition to perpetrating and condoning sexual harassment peers also perpetrate sexism by teasing other classmates who do not conform to gender norms research on group norms indicates that children who do not meet the norms or fit the stereotypes of the group can be bullied mocked or ostracized by group members abrams rutland cameron ferrell 2007 peers frequently harass and ostracize boys and girls who are deemed atypical for their gender jewell and brown 2014 russell et al. 2010 smith and leaper 2006 young and sweeting 2004 conversely highly gender-typical children have the most positive peer relations being rated as the most liked and the most popular egan and perry 2001 jewell and brown 2014 lobel et al. 1993 rose et al. 2011 this form of sexism is condoned with adolescents reporting that it is more acceptable to exclude or tease a gender-atypical peer than a gender-typical peer horn 2008 there is asymmetry however in that boys are more likely than girls to experience negative peer sanctions for low levels of gender typicality although peers make negative comments to girls when they engage in traditionally male activities such as athletics and mathematics leaper brown 2008 boys who appear feminine or have poor athletic abilities face even harsher repercussions from their peers lee and troop-gordon 2011 pascoe 2007 poteat scheer and mereish 2014 chapter 8 of this volume provide a detailed account of the frequency and consequences of the victimization of gender non-conforming and sexual minority youth although a discussion of the myriad ways that parents shape children x27 s gendered behavior is beyond the scope of this chapter parents can influence children x27 s academic lives through their own implicit and explicit sexism thus becoming an indirect means by which sexism occurs in school gunderson ramirez levine beilock 2012 like teachers some parents show implicit sexist attitudes about their children x27 s academic abilities in some studies parents perceived both science and math to be more important for boys than for girls they perceived boys to be more competent in science and math than girls and they expected higher science and math performance from boys than from girls andre et al. 1999 eccles et al. 2000 parents assumed girls are as not interested in computer science as sons sÃ¡inz pÃ¡lmen garcÃ­a-cuesta 2012 furthermore in one older study parents attributed boys math success to ability but they attributed girls math success to effort yee eccles 1988 parents stereotypes assumptions and expectations can influence their beliefs about their children s abilities and interests which in turn affect children s self-perceptions and performance gunderson et al. 2012 jacobs et al. 2005 research has consistently shown that parents expectations and beliefs about math particularly when they align with gender stereotypes can impact children x27 s math attitudes and aptitudes yee eccles 1988 parental expectations and the resulting encouragement and support behaviors can be more important than any actual academic experiences for example greek parents expectations and encouragement about computer science were stronger predictors than children x27 s own computer-based activities in predicting children x27 s computer self-efficacy vekiri chronaki 2008 beyond that parents have been shown to steer children x27 s occupational choices in stereotypical directions chhin et al. 2008 whiston and keller 2004 parents gender biases regarding academic achievement may also include the differential treatment of daughters and sons gunderson et al. 2012 studies conducted in the united states observed that parents of sons discussed math and science concepts more frequently and in more detail with their children than parents of daughters for example parents of preschoolers at a science museum were three times more likely to explain science exhibits to sons than to daughters crowley callanan tenenbaum allen 2001 another study observed that when parents were assigned to teach their 10-year-old child about a physics phenomenon fathers were more likely to use teaching talk e.g. by asking for causal explanations and using conceptual descriptions with sons than with daughters tenenbaum leaper 2003 still another investigation noted that motherâ€“son conversations included three times more talk about numbers and quantities than did motherâ€“daughter conversations chang sandhofer brown 2011 these patterns of differential treatment can privilege boys with relatively more background knowledge and comfort in math and science in turn these experiences help to strengthen boys self-efficacy and interest in these academic domains sexism has been documented in nearly all forms of children x27 s media media by presenting sexist images and narratives perpetuates common gender stereotypes that are then applied to children within schools this perpetuation of stereotypes can justify and reinforce sexism at school for example analyses of popular children x27 s television programs show that boys are portrayed as answering more questions telling others what to do more often and showing more ingenuity than girls aubrey harrison 2004 these stereotypes of boys as more assertive than girls are then reinforced by the differential treatment of boys shown by teachers video games typically portray boys as aggressive and girls as sexually objectified dill thill 2007 these stereotypes of aggressive boys and sexual girls further justify sexual harassment by boys directed at girls sexist portrayals of boys and girls also infiltrate educational media in elementary school textbooks females possess some masculine characteristics such as assertiveness but males rarely possess feminine characteristics such as empathy evans davies 2000 this trend is also evident in books prevalent in school libraries even among award-winning children x27 s books considered to be nonsexist boys rarely have feminine-stereotyped traits or occupations diekman murnen 2004 girls underrepresentation and the gender-stereotypical portrayal of occupations in children x27 s book continue in the new millennium hamilton anderson broaddus young 2006 sexism affects both boys and girls in school girls are stereotypically assumed to be less competent than boys in subjects related to science technology engineering and mathematics stem girls are also assumed to be less athletically competent than boys see solmon 2014 chapter 4 of this volume boys however are stereotypically assumed to perform worse than girls in their overall school achievement on the basis of these negative stereotypes boys and girls can be the target of sexism during academic classes and sports participation in this section we outline the differences between boys and girls in stem subjects athletic participation and overall school achievement and describe the ways in gender biases partially explain the gender differences in these domains students achievement in subjects related to stem is considered important for economic success in today x27 s increasingly technological world zakaria 2011 accordingly policymakers and researchers have been concerned with the gender gap in some stem fields compared to 57 of all bachelor x27 s degrees recently going to women in the united states only 43 of mathematics degrees 20 of physics degrees 16 of computer and information sciences and 18 of engineering went to women national center for education statistics nces 2013 the association between gender and bachelor x27 s degrees in these fields varies somewhat across the world however unesco 2010 also the gender gap in all of these fields has narrowed over the last four decades within the united states national science foundation nsf 2013 finally women are not underrepresented in all stem fields in the united states 58 of bachelor x27 s degrees in the biological and biomedical sciences recently went to women nsf 2013 average gender differences in achievement in mathematics and some science subjects emerge during adolescence see petersen hyde 2014 chapter 2 of this volume for a review the stem-related subject that has garnered the most interest is mathematics based on a recent meta-analysis of data collected across the world lindberg hyde petersen linn 2010 no significant average gender differences in mathematics test performance were indicated during elementary school and middle school however there was a significant but small difference favoring boys in high school and college the slight advantage seen among boys in high school parallels a trend whereby girls tend to decrease their interest in mathematics between middle school and high school hill corbett st. rose 2010 as far as other stem-related subjects there is cross-national evidence that boys scored significantly higher on average than girls on the timms high school physics test timms international study center 2000 also significantly higher averages for boys than for girls were indicated on the ap physics and the ap computer science exams hill et al. 2010 despite the slight average advantage for boys over girls in standardized test performances girls actually attained higher average grades in american high school math and science courses hill et al. 2010 national center for education statistics 2013 developmental scientists recognize that multiple factors contribute to gender-related variations in achievement see leaper 2013 there is strong evidence however that gender biases are among these influences studies suggest that many children stereotype males as better than females in many stem-related fields or they view stem fields as male domains for example this pattern has been indicated for mathematics e.g. muzzatti and agnoli 2007 steffens et al. 2010 physics e.g. andre et al. 1999 kessels 2005 and computer science e.g. mercier barron o x27 connor 2006 a few studies have begun to examine both implicit and explicit stereotyping in children in these investigations some children who did not explicitly endorse gender stereotypes about math showed evidence of implicit gender stereotypes cvencek et al. 2011 del rÃ­o and strasser 2013 steffens et al. 2010 these findings are notable because implicit attitudes may have an impact on self-concepts and performance e.g. nosek et al. 2009 steffens and jelenec 2011 nosek and colleagues 2009 examined nation-level variations in gender-science implicit stereotypes and eighth graders achievement in science and mathematics across the 34 countries sampled the implicit stereotyping of science as male was strongly related to national gender differences in eighth graders performances in science Î² 0.56 and mathematics Î² 0.52 girls internalization of gender stereotypes may affect achievement in stem-related subjects when interest and the perceived value of particular subjects have been assessed researchers commonly observed girls tended to rate mathematics physical science and computers and technology lower than did boys e.g. chow et al. 2012 dickhÃ¤user and stiensmeier-pelster 2003 else-quest et al. 2010 kessels 2005 riegle-crumb et al. 2006 as several studies have documented the perceived value of a domain generally predicts subsequent achievement see eccles wigfield 2002 the impact of negative gender stereotypes on performance has also been illustrated in research on stereotype threat when a social identity is threatened it can lead to heightened arousal that disrupts working memory and can impair controlled cognitive processing krendl richeson kelley heatherton 2008 as a result performance in assessment settings can suffer according to a recent meta-analysis testing for stereotype threat effects on female math performance picho rodriguez finnie 2013 there was a small overall effect size for high school students d 0.30 indicating girls math performance significantly declined during stereotype threat conditions other studies find it is possible to counteract stereotype threat for example it is sometimes possible to boost a person s performance when a positive stereotype about a self-relevant social identity is made salient ambady shih kim pittinksy 2001 furthermore stereotype threat effects can be subverted if the person uses strategies such as self-affirmation or focusing on an alternative social identity shapiro williams 2012 girls learn about negative gender stereotypes through their interactions with parents teachers and peers according to one survey study in the united states half of adolescent girls between 13 and 18 years reported hearing disparaging statements about girls in math science or computers from these sources leaper brown 2008 the most commonly cited perpetrators were male peers 32 which were followed by female peers 22 teachers/coaches 23 fathers 15 and mothers 12 the likelihood of these reports increased with age in a subsequent analysis of this data brown leaper 2010 it was found that girls experiences hearing these sexist comments were negatively related to their ability beliefs and interests in math and science even after controlling for grades and family backgrounds some parents hold gender-stereotypical views about math and science that may not reflect their children x27 s actual achievement when this occurs girls motivation and performance may suffer one longitudinal study found that these negative stereotypes in mothers predicted subsequent declines in daughters self-concepts and motivation in math and science e.g. bleeker jacobs 2004 another investigation observed that parental gender stereotyping of math was related to higher levels of intrusive parental support during homework and lower math ability beliefs in daughters bhanot jovanovic 2005 conversely other studies suggest ways that some parents may provide more encouraging behaviors to sons than to daughters regarding their achievement in stem-related subjects e.g. simpkins et al. 2005 tenenbaum and leaper 2003 tenenbaum et al. 2005 in summary negative gender stereotypes persist about girls in some stem fields these stereotypes may lead some parents and teachers to underestimate girls potential discrimination may occur through the relatively greater provision of encouragement to boys than to girls for achievement in stem subjects moreover it may also involve overtly discouraging comments about girls capacities to do well in these areas evidence suggests many girls internalize these biases decreasing their achievement within stem fields one of the most dramatic gender-related changes in achievement seen in the united states and many other countries has been the tenfold increase in girls participation in high school sports since the 1972 enactment of title ix of the u.s. civil rights act at the time participation in high school sports was approximately 4 for girls and 50 for boys today it is approximately 40 for girls and remains 50 for boys women x27 s sports foundation 2009 despite this change many children continue to stereotype sports as a male domain e.g. cockburn and clarke 2002 rowley et al. 2007 shakib 2003 also certain sports tend to be viewed as appropriate for boys only e.g. football wrestling or for girls only e.g. cheerleading ballet schmalz kerstetter anderson 2008 furthermore some girls may find athleticism conflicts with their peers norms for femininity and heterosexuality cockburn and clarke 2002 shakib 2003 hence in some social settings girls may experience pressures to drop out of sports according to one survey study in the united states three-fourths of adolescent girls between 13 and 18 years reported hearing disparaging statements about girls in sports leaper brown 2008 the most commonly cited perpetrators were male peers 54 which were followed by female peers 38 teachers/coaches 28 fathers 30 and mothers 25 the likelihood of these reports increased with age even if most girls are not being actively discouraged to participate in sports many of them may not be getting the same degree of support that boys experience studies suggest that peer popularity is more strongly tied to athletic participation among boys than among girls e.g. shakib veliz dunbar sabo 2011 also some parents are more likely to expect athletic achievement in sons than in daughters and therefore may express more enthusiasm for their son x27 s sports involvement in turn parents expectations of success generally tend to predict children x27 s actual achievement e.g. fredricks eccles 2002 finally the sports culture can be a context in which sexist and heterosexist attitudes are reinforced in boys in many schools teammates and coaches use misogynistic and antigay comments to enforce conformity and pressure achievement in players messner 1998 furthermore tolerance for aggression on the field or court may generalize whereby some athletes view aggressive behavior as legitimate for solving problems outside of the sport conroy silva newcomer walker johnson 2001 in some cases this may extend to an increased risk among some male athletes for sexual violence forbes adams-curtis pakalka white 2006 compared to girls boys are more likely to get lower grades and are more likely to drop out of high school in most industrialized countries unesco 2010 in many nonindustrialized countries the opposite trend is seen whereby school access may be limited primarily or solely to boys the specific subjects with the largest gender gap in achievement favoring girls include reading writing and the arts eurydice network 2010 national center for education statistics 2013 the gender gap in academic achievement extends into college among all bachelor x27 s degrees recently awarded in the united states only 43 went to men nces 2013 a similar gender gap in college degrees is seen in most oecd countries oecd 2013 within the united states the gender gap in academic achievement is wider for african americans and latino/as youths than for white european americans or asian americans nces 2013 research suggests that sexism and adherence to traditional notions of masculinity may partly account for these gender gaps sexism functions to maintain traditional status and power relations between men and women in society one manifestation of sexism involves discrimination against girls and women who seek to achieve in prestigious fields traditionally associated with males e.g. stem fields and sports another manifestation of sexism however occurs when pressures are placed on boys and men to conform to traditional conceptions of masculinity for example boys who are not viewed as tough or athletic are commonly teased jewell brown 2014 traditional masculinity can undermine some boys academic achievement in some communities doing well in school is viewed as a violation of masculine norms kessels and steinmayr 2013 legewie and diprete 2012 for example boys who are concerned with appearing tough may be reluctant to seek help or to comply with teachers authority e.g. kiefer and ryan 2008 santos et al. 2013 in addition specific subjectsâ€”such as reading or the artsâ€”may be viewed as being especially feminine e.g. plante et al. 2009 rowley et al. 2007 thus boys who do well in school or who like feminine-stereotyped subjects may be teased by their male peers e.g. sherriff 2007 van de gaer et al. 2006 furthermore these pressures may be more common among youths from lower-income or some ethnic minority backgrounds fuller-rowell doan 2010 endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology may undermine some boys academic achievement and lead them to resist teachers authority however some teachers and school administrators may exaggerate the extent and the degree that these patterns occur among boys teachers may form generalized expectations that girls are better than boys at school e.g. jones myhill 2004 boys may infer these sentiments about teachers expectations e.g. hartley sutton 2013 also boys in generalâ€”but especially african american and latino boysâ€”are subject to disproportionate rates of disciplinary action for school misbehavior barbarin et al. 2014 chapter 10 of this volume losen 2011 rowley et al. 2014 chapter 9 of this volume sexual harassment includes sexually disparaging comments unwanted sexual interest unwanted touching and sexual coercion it can involve physical aggression e.g. unwanted touching sexual coercion or verbal aggression e.g. unwelcome sexual comments homophobic insults also it can be expressed directly in face-to-face interactions or via electronic messages sent to the victim or sexual harassment can be expressed indirectly behind the target s back e.g. spreading sexual rumors the prevalence and the consequences of sexual harassment in school are reviewed below sexual harassment is a common experience for girls and boys in many countries around the world see leaper robnett 2011 for a review for example the american association of university women aauw 2011 conducted a study of sexual harassment in the united states based on a nationally representative sample of students in grades 7â€“11 across all grades 56 of girls and 40 of boys reported experiences with sexual harassment the gender gap in sexual harassment increased with age among 12th graders 62 of girls and 32 of boys reported having experienced sexual harassment when specific types of sexual harassment were examined across all grade levels girls were twice as likely as boys to report being targets of unwelcome sexual comments/jokes 46 of girls vs. 22 of boys girls and boys reported experiencing antigay or anti-lesbian insults at similar rates 18 of girls vs. 19 of boys given the importance of electronic media in many youths lives it is also pertinent to note that 36 of girls and 24 of boys experienced online sexual harassment through text messages e-mail or web postings the aauw survey also asked students to identify the gender of the perpetrators and to evaluate the attributes most likely associated with the targets of sexual harassment in general boys were more likely than girls to be perpetrators of sexual harassment among the students experiencing sexual harassment 66 identified boys 19 identified girls and 11 identified a combination of boys and girls as the perpetrators the attributes associated with students viewed as most likely to be sexually harassed reflected characteristics associated with sexual attractiveness or traditional gender roles the qualities attributed to girls who were most likely to be sexually harassed included being physically developed 58 very pretty 41 not pretty or not very feminine 32 or overweight 30 the attributes associated with boys considered most likely to be sexually harassed included being not athletic or not very masculine 37 overweight 30 or good looking 11 other surveys point to similar patterns as those reported in the aauw survey although the incidences of sexual harassment vary somewhat chiodo et al. 2009 lacasse et al. 2003 leaper and brown 2008 pepler et al. 2006 petersen and hyde 2009 wei and chen 2012 in some studies higher rates of peer sexual harassment were indicated for boys than for girls petersen and hyde 2009 wei and chen 2012 which may be related to higher rates of same-gender harassment among boys than among girls studies further suggest sexual harassment may be especially likely for sexual-minority youths i.e. lesbian gay bisexual transgender and intersex e.g. williams connolly pepler craig 2005 also higher rates of sexual harassment may occur for students in lower than in higher income neighborhoods aauw 2011 the aauw survey did not find evidence that ethnic or racial background moderated the incidence of sexual harassment aauw 2011 besides being somewhat more liable to be targets of sexual harassment girls are more likely than boys to be negatively affected by sexual harassment american association of university women aauw 2011 fineran and bolen 2006 sexual harassment also tends to have a more negative impact on sexual-minority boys than on heterosexual boys kosciw greytak diaz bartkiewicz 2010 negative reactions to sexual harassment include internalizing symptoms e.g. anxiety depression and decline in academic performance see american association of university women aauw 2011 leaper and robnett 2011 poteat et al. 2014 chapter 8 of this volume for example in the aauw survey some of the most commonly reported reactions to sexual harassment included not wanting to go to school 37 of girls and 25 of boys finding it difficult to study 24 of girls and 24 of boys staying home from school 14 of girls and 9 of boys and stopping doing an activity or sport 9 of girls and 5 of boys a longitudinal study of canadian youths chiodo et al. 2009 found that sexual harassment victimization during the 9th grade predicted higher incidences during the 11th grade of feeling unsafe in school emotional distress substance abuse and victimization by peers and dating partners experiences with sexual harassment also appear related to increased body image concerns among girls chiodo et al. 2009 lindberg et al. 2007 thus repeated experiences with sexual harassment can have negative consequences on girls and boys socioemotional adjustment and academic achievement in addition to research focusing on the impacts of sexism within schools research also examines children x27 s perceptions of sexism at the individual level their developing awareness of sexism in general and their coping responses when sexism is encountered perceiving sexism can be a complex phenomenon there are some instances when a child or an adolescent may be the target of sexism but is unaware of it for example a girl can hear a discouraging comment about her math abilities but she may attribute it to her individual poor performance rather than a gender-based stereotype there are other instances when the child is the target of sexism and perceives it as bias a high-achieving boy may be teased for not seeming tough but he can recognize the teasing is based on a stereotype of how boys are supposed to act each situation may differentially impact the child at the individual level perceiving sexism can be associated with negative psychological outcomes such as greater stress lower global self-esteem more emotional problems and more behavioral problems e.g. dubois burk-braxton swenson tevendale hardesty 2002 simultaneously there can also positive consequences of perceiving individual sexism after receiving personal negative feedback individuals can attribute the feedback to gender bias as opposed to their own competency thus maintaining a positive sense of self-efficacy brown bigler chu 2010 at the broader group level knowledge of sexism can help members of a group attribute underrepresentation to gender bias instead of innate group traits girls for example can attribute the lack of female u.s. presidents to institutional sexism instead of women being incompetent leaders bigler arthur hughes patterson 2008 knowledge of historical sexism regarding math and science careers has been shown to motivate girls to combat future discrimination pahlke bigler green 2010 knowledge of sexism can also help individuals be more accepting of gender nonconforming peers to challenge sexist comments by their peers and to view media and all other environmental inputs through a sexism filter that prevents such messages from reinforcing personal gender stereotyping and prejudice pahlke bigler martin 2014 most importantly when children are aware of sexism and can perceive it in any given situation they then have the opportunity to cope with it in the following section we first describe children x27 s developing awareness of sexism and then describe ways in which children cope with sexism when it does occur to be generally aware of sexism children must first have knowledge of gender stereotypes and gender inequalities evidence suggests that children are aware of gender stereotypes early in childhood well before they enter elementary school see halim ruble 2010 as children get older their knowledge of gender inequalities increases liben bigler and krogh 2001 found that by middle childhood children were aware of the greater status e.g. greater income associated with the jobs performed by men compared to jobs performed by women even when the jobs are fictional and thus not based on actual job characteristics by the start of elementary school the majority of children were aware that no woman has ever been president of the united states although this knowledge became more common across the elementary school years bigler et al. 2008 a little more than one-quarter of children with slightly higher rates among girls than among boys spontaneously attributed the historical lack of female presidents to discrimination e.g. people like voting for boys more than girls. one quarter of children agreed with the statement that it is currently against the law for a woman to be president a form of institutional sexism and half believed that individual voters would be discriminatory bigler et al. 2008 as children enter adolescence they become more aware of societal levels of gender inequality yet although women still make 70 cents for every dollar paid to men and are underrepresented in the upper echelon of corporations children are more likely to perceive status inequalities in politics than in the business world neff cooper woodruff 2007 beyond knowledge of sexism in general children can also recognize gender discrimination in their own lives by middle childhood in surveys about school gender bias given to students in fourth through eighth grade brown et al. 2011 girls typically reported that boys receive preferential treatment in athletics e.g. the p.e teacher always thinks boys will be faster in contrast boys reported that girls are given preferential treatment within the classroom e.g. when a girl does something wrong the teacher never gets her in trouble a boy does the same thing and he always gets in trouble although children and adolescents are generally aware of sexism and capable of perceiving discrimination see brown bigler 2005 individuals perceive themselves to be the target of discrimination rather infrequently crosby 1984 taylor et al. 1990 as reported above although approximately 50 of adolescent girls reported that they had experienced gender discrimination within academic or athletic domains most girls reported it happening only once or twice within the last year interestingly such low frequencies are common in studies of perception of racial and ethnic discrimination as well e.g. benner and graham 2011 brody et al. 2006 greene et al. 2006 the adoption of conservative standards for labeling negative treatment as gender discrimination or sexism may be due to the psychological costs associated with perceiving oneself to be the target of discrimination quinn roese pennington olson 1999 to date most research on children x27 s perceptions of sexism involves retrospective self-reports of their past experiences with discrimination although such studies are important they provide little information about when and why some but not other individuals perceive themselves to be targets of discrimination furthermore it begs the question of whether children are actually only infrequently subject to discriminatory treatment on the basis of gender or whether individual and developmental factors affect children x27 s tendency to perceive experiences as discriminatory to answer these questions experimental studies are required in which the feedback and the context are tightly controlled two experimental studies have examined children x27 s perceptions of individual sexism in one study elementary school children were read stories in which a teacher treated a boy and a girl differently from one another when children were told that the teacher had a history of favoring one gender over the other children were more likely to attribute the teacher x27 s behavior to discrimination than more benign reasons and this attribution was more frequent among children in upper than in lower elementary school brown bigler 2004 however when children were given no information about the teacher x27 s past choices or were told the teacher had a history of fairness they were more likely to blame the child x27 s lack of effort or ability for the negative treatment a slightly different pattern emerged in a separate experimental study in which children were given negative feedback about their own performance in a presumed art contest i.e. they were told they lost an art contest brown et al. 2010 of the very few children who perceived personal discrimination 8 of 108 children they only perceived their own negative feedback to be due to gender discrimination when they were told a the contest judges were of the other gender b the contest judges picked other-gender winners in previous years and c the contest judges picked other-gender winners this year despite all of the experimental clues suggesting gender discrimination at work and despite children x27 s awareness of sexism in general very few children perceived themselves to the target of gender discrimination these findings suggest that surveys of children and adolescents experience with sexism are likely to yield underestimates of the frequency of these experiences beyond children x27 s tendency to perceive gender discrimination in certain contexts more than others developmental models of children and adolescents perceptions of discrimination posit that awareness of sexism is influenced by the child x27 s cognitive development situational variables gender attitudes and gender brown bigler 2005 for example within any given situation children with more advanced social perspective-taking abilities and classification skills and children who can better compare their outcomes with others will be more likely to perceive sexism than children with less advanced cognitive abilities furthermore evidence suggests that children perceive sexism more readily when it is directed toward others or toward a group than when directed at themselves brown and bigler 2004 brown et al. 2010 and when they perceive available social supports leaper brown 2008 children x27 s gender attitudes are also associated with their awareness of sexism adolescent girls were more likely to recognize gender discrimination when they held gender-egalitarian attitudes brown and bigler 2004 leaper and brown 2008 or reported having learned about feminism leaper brown 2008 finally girls are more likely to perceive sexism than boys during middle childhood and adolescence this pattern may reflect girls greater awareness of their lower social status relative to males e.g. brown and bigler 2004 brown et al. 2011 brown et al. 2010 dubois et al. 2002 when youths perceive sexism the ways in which they cope with the experience are important in influencing the outcome according to lazarus and folkman x27 s 1984 model of stress and coping effective coping to any stressful situation including experiencing sexism depends on the person s cognitive appraisal of the stressful event and the subsequent type of behavioral coping strategy used there are two broad types of coping strategies used in response to sexism and the type of strategy used is partially based on the individual s appraisal of the costs and benefits of each behavioral response a general distinction is often made between approach or engagement and avoidant or disengagement coping strategies compas et al. 2001 lazarus 1999 lazarus and folkman 1984 magley 2002 approach strategies are oriented toward addressing the threat these might include confronting the source of the stress e.g. confronting someone about sexist behavior or seeking social support e.g. talking to someone about what happened people may seek others to gain emotional reassurance to clarify their understanding of the situation or to get advice in contrast avoidance strategies are oriented away from the threat such as downplaying or ignoring the event in general research indicates that approach strategies are more effective than avoidant strategies in reducing stress in adolescents compas et al. 2001 and adults lazarus 1999 in response to sexism approach strategies can empower the individual reduce stress and increase motivation whereas avoidance strategies can lead to a sense of helplessness and diminish motivation e.g. miller and major 2000 swim and thomas 2006 recent research has highlighted the relevance of the stress and coping model to adolescent girls and women x27 s experiences with sexism e.g. ayres et al. 2009 cortina and wasti 2005 kaiser and miller 2004 for example kaiser and miller 2004 found that women x27 s cognitive appraisals predicted their likelihood of confrontational responses to recent experiences with sexism researchers have found that adolescent girls and young women who perceive social support were more likely to use approach coping strategies than girls without social support holahan et al. 1995 moradi and funderburk 2006 feeling supported from friends or parents particularly mothers may bolster girls confidence to use approach coping strategies when sexism occurs leaper brown ayres 2013 this could include either confronting perpetrators of sexism or seeking others for advice and emotional support e.g. cortina wasti 2005 having a meaningful social identity particularly one that is empowering in the face of sexism also seems to be important in helping individuals cope with sexism some evidence for example suggests that having a feminist identification helps girls and women cope with gender discrimination e.g. ayres et al. 2009 leaper and arias 2011 this parallels research on ethnic identity which finds that having a positive ethnic identity helps buffer against the negative effects of ethnic discrimination e.g. umaÃ±a-taylor updegraff 2007 because of the important social emotional and academic consequences of sexism from peers and teachers numerous attempts have been made to reduce gender biases in school some attempts involve experimental interventions directed at changing children x27 s behaviors and attitudes some attempts involve changing the school itself either the school climate or the school infrastructure in this section we outline ways that sexism can potentially be reduced within schools beginning with changes to the gender composition of the schools and then discussing interventions that have been implemented within existing schools one approach to reduce sexism within schools has been to segregate schools or at least classes within schools on the basis of gender see bigler hayes liben 2014 chapter 7 of this volume instituting single-gender public education is possible because of changes to educational policy enacted after no child left behind act was passed in 2001 and the u.s. department of education doe issued new regulations in 2006 since then more than 1000 school districts in 46 states have instituted some degree of single-sex public education although the exact numbers are difficult to determine klein sesma 2011 proponents of single-gender schools argue that segregated education reduces sexism in schools in two ways first several influential proponents of single-gender education argue that there are important innate sex differences between boys and girls brain structure e.g. differences in size of corpus collosum hormones and physiology gurian 2001 sax 2005 because of these supposed differences they argue that boys and girls have different learning styles and interests and teaching boys and girls similarly constitutes a form of bias for example gurian 2001 argues that girls are not as capable as boys of abstract thought instead needing to have things conceptualized in usable everyday language replete with concrete details p. 46 thus according to this argument it is unfair to teach girls abstract concepts in the same way that boys are taught supporters of this approach also argue that boys and girls have innately different interests and to be equitable schools should tailor education toward those interests for example some schools are using hunting analogies in lessons for boys and dishwashing analogies for girls weil 2008 the second reason that some schools implement single-gender education is based on the argument that regardless of biological and neurological differences the current coeducational schools are overly feminine and fail to meet the needs of boys especially ethnic minority boys see barbarin et al. 2014 chapter 10 of this volume thus contributing to the behavioral problems of boys e.g. whitmire 2010 they cite evidence that boys are twice as likely as girls to be suspended and more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder rao seaton 2009 they also argue that girls are overly inhibited around boys largely because of boys domination of teacher attention and girls concerns with being attractive to boys see salomone 2006 there are many critics of single-gender education critics of single-gender education argue that educational segregation by gender is by definition a form of gender bias halpern et al. 2011 critics point to research indicating that gender segregation in education actually fosters and increases gender stereotypes fabes pahlke martin hanish 2013 recent research shows that randomly assigning children to one single-gender class led to a 14 increase in the odds of believing that boys are better than girls at math and girls are better than boys at language arts. children who were randomly assigned to eight single-gender classes were 112 more likely to become gender-stereotypic fabes et al. 2013 additional negative consequences of gender segregation are outlined by martin fabes hanish 2014 chapter 5 of this volume neuroscientists also point out that there are in fact very few innate differences in brain structures hormones and physiology eliot 2009 they argue that there are small differences at birth that become larger as children are increasingly socialized in gender-stereotypical ways eliot 2009 thus basing educational policy on sex differences that do not exist is misguided halpern et al. 2011 several meta-analyses have examined whether single-gender education is educationally beneficial compared to coeducational education shortly before issuing regulations for the implementation of single-gender education the u.s. department of education 2005 found that there were no conclusive educational advantages to single-gender education after taking into account various moderators e.g. participants socioeconomic status methodological factors the results of two additional meta-analyses indicated no meaningful differences in educational outcomes when comparing single-gender versus coeducational schooling pahlke et al. 2014 signorella et al. 2013 because there seem to be important disadvantages of single-gender education i.e. increased gender stereotypes and no educational advantages pahlke et al. 2014 signorella et al. 2013 u.s. department of education office of planning 2005 critics of single-gender education argue that segregating by gender is not the solution for reducing sexism within schools see bigler et al. 2014 chapter 7 of this volume other approaches to reducing sexism within schools have taken a more direct approach to countering the bias that occurs some approaches teach children to confront sexism they encounter some approaches help children attribute negative feedback to discrimination when it is appropriate and other approaches try to reduce the impact of sexism on children x27 s academic outcomes first some interventions have taught individuals to confront instances of bias that they witness research has shown that teaching people to publically confront instances of prejudice can reduce the biases of those who witness the confrontation czopp monteith mark 2006 this has been shown to be particularly influential when the confrontation comes from an individual who is not the target of bias but rather from a bystander rasinski czopp 2010 extending this research which was focused on ethnic bias to instances of gender bias some studies have examined whether confronting sexism reduces the sexist attitudes of those who witness the confrontation within the classroom teachers are important individuals to train to confront sexism teachers who confront sexism in the classroom because of their special authority within the class are particularly able to model a gender-fair norm pornpitakpan 2004 in one study students saw videotaped vignettes in which a student made a sexist comment about girls not being good at math boysen 2013 the teacher in the video either confronted the offending student or ignored the comment college students who watched the teacher confront the sexist student showed reduced sexist attitudes after watching the confrontation boysen 2013 importantly in a follow-up study students showed a similar reduction in sexist attitudes after watching a peer confront a sexist student boysen 2013 fewer interventions have tried to teach children how to confront and thus reduce sexism in one effective example lamb bigler liben and green 2009 taught elementary school children to respond to sexist comments they heard from peers most of the comments that peers said to one another involved teasing a gender-atypical student the researchers taught children to use funny retorts e.g. you can t say girls can t play or direct rebuttals to the sexist comments they found that the training intervention particularly when children practiced the responses using role-playing was effective in increasing children x27 s confrontation of sexist comments similar results were replicated in pahlke et al. 2014 indeed using retorts in response to sexism seemed to spread over time to the other experimental groups large-scale bystander intervention studies e.g. the green dot program in which college students are taught to speak out and report instances of violence against women have also been effective in increasing confrontations against sexism coker et al. 2011 other approaches have suggested that it is beneficial for children to recognize sexism when they encounter it thus making it possible to attribute their negative feedback to external rather than internal causes and recognize it as unfair to test this premise the effects of learning about gender discrimination on american adolescent girls science motivation were tested in an experiment weisgram bigler 2007 girls participated in a program aimed at increasing interest in science with the experimental group additionally receiving lessons about gender-based occupational discrimination girls in the experimental group showed increased self-efficacy and value about science after learning about gender discrimination compared to the control group who did not learn about discrimination additional research has shown that learning about past discrimination inspires girls to battle future discrimination pahlke et al. 2010 these studies suggest that one way to reduce the impact of sexism is to directly teach about sexism because bystander inventions and confronting sexism when it is encountered seem to be an important step in reducing sexism within schools approaches that alter the entire school climate are likely to be the most effective in reducing sexism in other words it is likely that school-wide programs that make sexism unacceptable and make it normative to confront sexism will show the greatest reduction in sexism these broad-based interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing bullying at schools o x27 moore and minton 2005 salmivalli et al. 2005 the goal of these approaches is to change the climate so that peers are intolerant to bullying research has shown that the greater and more widespread the implementation the larger the effects for example schools were most effective in reducing bullying when they implemented a school-wide policy against bullying when teachers were educated about bullying and when teachers worked with their entire classroom using role-playing and establishing anti-bullying rules salmivalli et al. 2005 sexual harassment perpetration seems to be largely influenced by school climate attar-schwartz 2009 for example ormerod collinsworth and perry 2008 examined the impact of sexual harassment on high school students school climate moderated the impact of sexual harassment on both girls and boys when the school climate was tolerant of sexual harassment the impacts on self-esteem body image psychological distress school withdrawal and perceptions of school safety were worse as we have reviewed in our chapter sexism in schools can undermine the academic achievement and social adjustment of girls and boys sexism outside of school can also affect children s behavior and motivation in the classroom the perpetrators of sexism may include teachers parents peers and media in these contexts children may experience gender-stereotyped biases regarding the kinds of achievements that are viewed desirable or inappropriate for girls and boys some of the biases that we reviewed include negative stereotypes about girls and women in many stem fields and athletics we also noted how traditional notions of masculinity can undermine boys overall academic achievement furthermore surveys indicate that most girls and boys experience sexual harassment in schools in addition to the negative impact on their socioemotional adjustment sexual harassment can reduce students academic motivation next we addressed factors related to students awareness of sexism in schools as well as effective coping strategies that can bolster students resilience in the face of sexist events finally we considered some of the strategies that have been examined for reducing gender bias and sexism in schools in contrast to some who have advocated single-gender schools as a means to improve boys and girls academic success comprehensive reviews of the research literature do not point to meaningful difference between single-gender and coeducational schooling in relation to student outcomes other strategies such as teaching about gender bias promoting proactive coping in children and fostering an egalitarian school climate may be more promising ways to increase the success of both girls and boys in our schools elsevier we use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads by continuing you agree
