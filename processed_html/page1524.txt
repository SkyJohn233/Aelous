Best in Normanton - Review of Chun Chun Chinese, Normanton, England - TripAdvisor Been here a few times and never disappoints with quality of food also good value. Tried all others in Normanton this is defiantly the best.  3  -  7  of  14  reviews Nice takeaway, always on time, good selection, the last time we ordered there was a decent vegitarian selection. Always hot when it gets here and as a bonus the delivery person is always pleasant.  This is the first time we've had a delivery from this wonderful chinese takeaway. The food was delivered piping hot in half the time they said at the point of ordering. The quantities were ginormous! Will be using again. I really want to make this place up so good. They are fast helpful and FTSE food is always hot. Freebies too.  Been here a few times now and enjoyed every meal. Big portions, good value and tasty food. Will be back again soon.
