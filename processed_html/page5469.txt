I am very new to extjs. I want to call onclick event once I click on div, Below is the code. Please help, Thanks in advance. I want the div with class  "list-item"  clicked and the value of its id. You should be able to use the itemclick listener: Here is a  Sencha Fiddle  demonstrating its use. When you are  NOT  using a  View  then itemSelector is not available, in such cases you can do something like:                                  Click here to upload your image                                 (max 2 MiB) Cancel and add another image You can also provide a  link from the web .
