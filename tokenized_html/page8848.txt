genetic risk of type 2 diabetes in populations of the african continent a systematic review and meta-analyses sciencedirect sciencedirect • this is a first systematic review and meta-analysis of genetic studies of t2d in africa available genetic studies of t2d in africa mostly originate in northern africa the role of tcf7l2 and kcnq snps which showed greatest effect in europeans and asians respectively is unclear in africans according to our meta-analysis larger-scale studies will help understanding the genetic mechanisms of type 2 diabetes in africa type 2 diabetes t2d is growing faster in africa than anywhere else driven by the dual effects of genetic and environmental factors we conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of published studies on genetic markers of t2d in populations within africa multiple databases were searched for studies of genetic variants associated with t2d in populations living in africa studies reporting on the association of a genetic marker with t2d or indicators of glycaemia were included data were extracted on study design and characteristics genetic determinants effect estimates of associations with t2d overall 100 polymorphisms in 57 genes have been investigated in relation with t2d in populations within africa in 60 studies almost all studies used the candidate gene approach with 88 published during 2006–2014 and 70 42/60 originating from tunisia and egypt polymorphisms in ace agrp enos gstp1 hsp70-2 mc4r mthfr phlpp pol1 tcf7l2 and tnf-α gene were found to be associated with t2d with overlapping effect on various cardiometabolic traits the polymorphisms investigated in multiple studies mostly had consistent effects across studies with only modest or no statistical heterogeneity effect sizes were modestly significant e.g. odd ratio 1.49 95 ci 1.33–1.66 for tcf7l2 rs7903146 underpowered genome-wide studies revealed no diabetes risk loci specific to african populations current evidence on the genetic markers of t2d in african populations mostly originate from north african countries is overall scanty and largely insufficient to reliably inform the genetic architecture of t2d across africa the prevalence of diabetes has increased worldwide including in africa where the greatest proportional increase 90 in the number of diabetes cases is projected to occur by 2030 1 2 type 2 diabetes t2d represents more than 90 of diabetes cases in africa 1 2 the surge in t2d in africa has been primarily attributed to environmental factors due to nutrition transition and urbanization that bring about lifestyle changes however current understanding of the pathophysiology of t2d in populations within africa remains elusive from observations among other populations around the world it is obvious that t2d has a strong genetic component as evidenced by a high concordance rate 70 in monozygotic twins 3 and the over 40 risk of having t2d for an offspring of a t2d patient 4 unlike simple monogenic diseases the pathophysiology of t2d involves most of the time an interaction of several common genetic risk factors of low penetrance with environmental factors hitherto the vast majority of t2d-related risk alleles have been identified through genome-wide association studies mostly conducted in european descendants and asian populations 5 these findings can hardly be extrapolated to other ethnic groups due to differences in biological traits cultural practices and lifestyle habits indeed many common loci originally associated with t2d in caucasians have not been replicated in non-european populations 6 furthermore africa is traditionally known to harbor more genetic variations than any other continent 7 8 it is therefore important to understand the role of genes in populations within africa as there may be specific genetic susceptibility to t2d in these groups in addition studying these populations through genome-wide association and fine mapping has the potential to provide valuable insights into the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes and further explain geographical differences in prevalence this systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes existing studies on genetic risk inferred by polymorphisms related to t2d among africa-based populations and explores the significance of the overall effects of the tested genes and heterogeneity in those effects across regions and major population groupings we searched medline via pubmed and embase for articles published until june 2014 without any date or language restriction we used a combination of relevant search terms presented in appendix pp 2–3 two investigators yyy and mgf independently identified articles and sequentially titles abstracts and then full texts screened them for inclusion fig 1 we also scanned the references lists of relevant publications and identified their citations through the web of science any disagreements were solved by consensus or review by a third investigator apk fig 1 selection process for studies included in the systematic review we included genetic association studies conducted on african populations residing in the continent that include diagnosed diabetes and/or markers of glucose homeostasis used as an outcome studies had to meet the following criteria i original papers containing independent data ii case-control or cohort iii sufficient data to calculate the odds ratio or with a confidence interval ci we excluded duplicate publications studies conducted exclusively on migrant populations of african descent living outside the continent fig 1 shows the study selection process two reviewers yyy and mgf independently extracted data from included studies on settings design populations characteristics and measures of genetic association there is currently no convincing evidence of specific study characteristics that can be used to assess the validity of genetic studies included in a systematic review as recommended by sagoo et al 9 we assessed the presence of bias considering the following case definition population stratification reporting of methods used sample size of a study population genotyping method and its reliability/accuracy validation of results statistical analyses for the polymorphisms investigated in multiple studies we derived the pooled estimates of their association with diabetes risk across studies using a random effects model meta-analysis implemented using stata software statacorp texas usa we used the cochran q statistic which follows the chi square distribution with k −1 degrees of freedom df to assess the heterogeneity within and between included studies with a p -value 0.05 indicating significant heterogeneity 10 heterogeneity in the measure of association across studies was further quantified with the i 2 statistic with value 25 indicating low heterogeneity 25–50 indicating moderate heterogeneity 50–75 indicating high heterogeneity and 75 indicating extreme heterogeneity 11 publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and the egger test of bias 12 a funnel plot is a scatter plot of the effect estimates log odds ratio in the current review from individual studies against a measure of precision of those effect estimates standard error of the log odds ratio in the current review this measure of precision is often plotted on the vertical axis and in a reverse scale that places large studies at the top and smaller studies at the bottom because estimates from larger studies are likely more precise they will tend to cluster around the overall estimate central line while estimates from increasingly smaller and accordingly less precise studies will tend to be more scatter but symmetrical about the central vertical line giving an overall inverse funnel shape when there is no publication bias an asymmetrical funnel shape indicate a relationship between the effect size and precision in the studies at hands this is often due to reporting bias publication bias although it could also be due to a systematic difference between larger and smaller studies or to the presence of a subset of studies with a different mean effect size 13 14 because visual inspection of the symmetry of the funnel plot can be challenging it is often supplemented by formal statistical tests egger test for instance a total of 3014 published records were identified through searches titles and where necessary abstracts/summaries of these records were screened for relevance to the systematic review and 2951 were excluded by disease study population and study design mutation analysis genetic marker/loci linkage studies pharmacogenetics and reviews fig 2 shows a linear growth over time in the number of genetic studies on diabetes in africa with over

28 29 30 across four population groups ghanaian tunisian morocco and nigerians only one rs7903146 was associated with type 2 diabetes amidst the two snps rs1800630 and rs1800629 of the tnf-α gene were investigated in four studies 31 32 33 in two non-specified populations tunisian and egyptian rs1800630 was found to be related to type 2 diabetes in a tunisian population 32 in the two genome-wide studies significant linkage signal regions identified were 10q23 and 4p15 while few other regions had logarithm odds scores considered as suggestive evidence of linkage appendix pp 17 15 16 the pooled estimates of the effect of various genes are shown in fig 3 and appendix pp 18–21 across five studies that assessed the effects of the tcf7l2 gene using additive models the pooled odd ratio or was 1.49 95 confidence interval ci 1.33–1.66 i 2 42.5 p -heterogeneity 0.138 equivalent figures were 1.41 1.08–1.85 number of studies 2 i 2 0 p -heterogeneity 0.612 from recessive models and 1.42 1.34–1.51 number of studies 20 i 2 1.8 p -heterogeneity 0.435 from unspecified models therefore regardless of the genetic model applied tcf7l2 appeared to confer a 41 –45 higher odd of diabetes in african populations with this effect being similar across studies and genetic models pooled ors for the mthrf gene were 1.39 1.13–1.70 number of studies 2 i 2 0 p -heterogeneity 0.603 from additive models 0.99 0.83–1.18 number of studies 4 i 2 90.2 p -heterogeneity 0.001 from dominant models 1.27 0.91–1.77 number of studies 4 i 2 61.1 p -heterogeneity 0.052 from recessive models and 1.43 1.03–1.99 number of studies 3 i 2 89.3 p -heterogeneity 0.001 from unspecified models these altogether suggested that an effect of mthrf of diabetes risk in african populations if any is weak and inconsistent across studies and genetic models the pooled effects of the kcnq1 kcnj11 and the enpp1 genes were non-significant regardless of the genetic models with little evidence of statistical heterogeneity suggesting that the contribution of these genes to diabetes occurrence in african populations is either trivial or uncertain based on available studies studies from sub-saharan africa largely reported estimates from unspecified genetic models while studies from northern africa largely reported estimates from specific genetic model precluding meaningful regional comparison of the pooled effect estimates with the exception of dominant genetic models p 0.025 there was no evidence of publication bias as indicated in appendix pp 22 all p 0.262 for the egger s test of bias fig 3 forest plot for the effects of genes from additive models on the risk of diabetes across studies in africa for each included study the solid diamond is for the effect size odd ratio of the association of the relevant genetic marker with diabetes risk and the size of the diamond is proportional to the inverse variance of the effect estimate the horizontal bars about the solid diamond represent the 95 confidence intervals for each genetic marker the bottom opened diamond is for the pooled effect size based on random effects models for each study the minor allele and its frequency in participants with diabetes cases and those without controls are shown as well as the odd ratio and the 95 confidence interval for the association of the genetic marker of interest with diabetes risk for each genetic marker measures of heterogeneity of the association with diabetes risk across included studies i -squared and p -value are shown our review provides a comprehensive and integrated perspective of replication studies on the genetic of t2d in populations within the african continent extant studies have tested several polymorphisms in 57 genes reported to be associated with t2d in other populations the included studies largely used a candidate gene approach with a trend mostly toward consistent effects for genes tested in multiple studies with a modest effect size of the variants with a positive signal regarding the effects of common variants with the greatest effects on the risk of type 2 diabetes in other populations namely tcf7l2 in europeans and kcnq in asians 34 their role in africans is unclear the two genome-wide studies revealed potential linkage signals in chromosomes regions harboring or next to these genes while studies of selected snps of the two genes mostly found no association of kcnq with diabetes risk the importance of performing genetic studies of diabetes in african populations to fine map the causal genetic variants was recently been emphasized by the work of the meta-analysis of type 2 diabetes in african americans media consortium 35 although the media consortium found that a substantial number of previously reported susceptibility loci for t2d were transferable to african americans they also identified novel susceptibility loci specific to this population furthermore for those loci shared between african americans and other populations the strongest association in african americans was often found in nearby snps and not necessarily the snps originally reported in other populations 35 therefore just like trans-ethnic fine mapping resequencing efforts are also needed to uncover novel signal and functional coding alleles in transcripts close to loci known to be causally related with t2d in other populations 36 37 in line with findings of the media consortium 35 meta-analyses of gwas have consistently demonstrated that some genetic diabetes risk signals were transferrable across populations while others were population specific 6 38 our review found only two studies that had examined the human genome using gwas in the same african population but which were underpowered to possibly uncover those diabetes risk loci that are specific to populations within africa 15 16 of the genetic variants reported to confer the strongest risk of diabetes in europeans tcf7l2 and asians kcnq only tcf7l2 was transferable to populations within africa studies on the heterogeneity of the effects of transferrable genetic risk variants across population have been mostly consistent in reporting the similarities of effects estimates 6 39 for a potentially susceptible gene such as tcf7l2 with a positive signal across a few studies in our review the pooled odd ratio was essentially within the range of those reported in asians and caucasians 6 suggesting a homogeneity of the genetic effects across population this homogeneity if confirmed would tend to project a prominent contribution of differences in environmental factors to the currently observed variability in diabetes figures across populations the interest in studying the genetics of diabetes is driven among others by the prospects of translating the genetic findings to inform medical practice thus far the major contribution of genetic discoveries to medical practice regarding diabetes mellitus has been limited to the tiny proportion of patients with rare monogenic forms of the disease 40 there are suggestions that in these rare forms the implicated risk alleles tend to affect the coding sequences of the dna resulting in predictable effects on the functions of the genes this knowledge in turn can be used to improve the prognosis and treatment of the disease in the polygenetic forms of the disease however susceptibility signals are mostly located outside of the coding sequences the dna and may affect more regulation of the transcription and not the functions of the genes 41 this makes very challenging the translation efforts of genetic information relating to the large majority of diabetes however possible applications include uncovering novel prevention and treatment targets improving disease risk prediction and diagnosis and personalized medicine 34 with regard to prediction available evidence suggests that common known alleles associated with t2d add little to disease prediction beyond knowledge from traditional diabetes risk factors 42 43 interest in investigating further the contribution of genetic information to diabetes prediction and diagnosis in africa is motivated by the existence of variants of likely type 2 diabetes with particular phenotypes treatment and motoring requirements that are more frequent in african population yet regularly underdiagnosed in routine clinical setting 44 we did not address the overlap of genes associated with t2d with other cardiometabolic traits or long-term complications of the disease nor did we address monogenic diabetes some snps known to be associated with obesity related traits and other cardiometabolic risk factors have been found to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes likewise loci influencing type 2 diabetes risk glycemic traits and insulin levels have been reported to be associated with obesity related traits and cardiovascular diseases risk 45 46 47 48 in the presence of overlapping associations uncritical adjustment for the effect of other cardiometabolic factors on type 2 diabetes risk could obscure or attenuate the effects the tested loci 47 the strengths of our review are manifold we comprehensively and rigorously appraised the extant data including the whole spectrum of evidence from african countries which was not the case with previous reviews and addressing issues specific and relevant to the african context and also identifying gaps in research more importantly we conducted meta-analyses increasing the likelihood of detecting the effects of variant examined across multiple studies our study does have limitations first existing studies genetic association studies did not always report key methodological information that include testing the hwe the sample size/power calculations clear description of controls consideration and correction for population stratification as well as the levels of adjustment conducted second compared to studies conducted elsewhere sample sizes were less substantial it is possible that with larger sample sizes and more comprehensive platforms some additional previously proposed candidate genes may reach statistical significance the limited sample size indicates that the studied populations may not cover all the scope of human genetic variations that exist on the african continent third some variants were investigated in single studies thus precluding a literature-based meta-analysis furthermore we had no access to individual data precluding refined analyses and adjustment for potential confounders and other types of bias hence we could not assess potential sources of bias over the last ten years there has been progress in the investigation of the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes among african populations however important gaps are yet to be filled existing studies have mainly been confined to certain populations thus precluding the full examination of the potential genetic variation across the continent hitherto the conducted studies have been replication endeavor thus it is still unclear whether there may be genetic variants that confer the risk of diabetes exclusively among african populations carefully and well-designed larger-scale studies are therefore needed in which assessment of gene environment interaction can also be addressed however this would require well-coordinated multi-centered groups working within research consortia to establish large enough cohorts with recruitment in several african countries especially since genetic research on the continent has been hindered by a number of challenges such as limited funding as well as the lack of infrastructure and local expertise 49 50 such coordinated efforts would enable going beyond the scope of the extant data and conduct studies including family-based gene–environment and gene–gene interactions and genome-wide association analyses such studies may provide further insights in the etiology of type 2 diabetes in summary we have presented a systematic and comprehensive assessment of the current evidence on genetic determinants of type 2 diabetes in africa the putative genetic risk factors that have emerged from current overview represent the most promising type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes described to date in africans however larger-scale genetic studies will further expand our knowledge of the underlying genetic mechanisms of type 2 diabetes among africans y.y.y acquired data analysed data interpreted data drafted and revised the manuscript for intellectual content m.g.f acquired data analysed data
