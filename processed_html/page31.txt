Astrid Appels Returns for Zada Enterprises LLC WEF Dressage Classic CDI | Horses Daily Currently  working on her Doctorate in English literature, Appels, who graduated valedictorian  in 2002 at the University of Brussels, is one of only 4 in her country  to be awarded the coveted fellowship. Fortunately for us, this allows  her a bit more freedom to be available to assist us in person more often. In addition to her annual trip in September for our Dressage at Devon  coverage, we have finally convinced her to join us for our annual August  trip to Jackson Hole, for The Event at Jackson Hole presented by Lexus,  a Gold Cup qualifier for the sport of eventing. Appels  owns and operates the popular eurodressage.com website, which is one  of the world s leading websites, along with dressagedaily.com,  for dressage news and photos. She has since covered many events with  us both in the United States and Europe, including Aachen, The World Equestrian Games, Dressage  at Devon, and several North American Young Rider competitions. Ms. Appels  manages our busy HorseMarket Section and Who s Who, in addition  to monitoring and contributing on a daily basis to Dressagedaily and  our ScoreSource.  Astrid  had the opportunity to meet with many of her fans, who knew she would  be coming back, from the editorial she recently posted on eurodressage.com. We and the international dressage community are proud and lucky to have  her as a part of our team.
