Alum : &# xA0; I like the studying atmosphere and the rigor. This is a very ambitious school. The one thing I wish they would improve is their mental health awareness. I also wish that more teachers/counselors could promote identity outside of academic success such as success as an artist, a chef, and/or just a housewife even! Read  410 Reviews Junior : &# xA0; When I came to Northview I couldn ' t speak english very well but they have a special class for ESOL student and there are some benefits for them for example In the history classes we have a teacher that help us to understand the chapter better and explains everything that we don ' t understand, in general all the teachers are nice and they explains everything to us slowly so that  we can understand also the counselor helps me a lot, she told me about the graduation requirement  and how I can get to the good colleges. Also Northview has a lot of clubs I personally join to the chess club and they registered us for the tournaments. Northview Gave us each chromebook which make our job a lot easier we don ' t have to carry a lot of book with ourselves and all the books are available online.  At the end I love going to school when my is school is Northview! Read  583 Reviews Sophomore : &# xA0; I am currently a sophomore here. Although the academics are extremely challenging, especially for taking all honors classes, I know I &# x2019;m actually learning something in life. New school is cool, academics and athletics are great, and it is nice to know we go to one of the hardest schools/best schools in the state and even top in the country! (UsaWorldreport 2018 ranked us 160 out of 17000 high schools in the country) Read  479 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Alpharetta High School is a place with lots of diversity and strengths in all areas of sports, education, music and more! The teachers work hard to provide comfort and rigor and the administration is always looking ours for helping students with becoming their best and growing the most. Read  444 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Lambert is a great high school if you stay with the right crowd. Being involved in clubs and the different pathways such as business, engineering, healthcare(I &# x2019;m with that one), etc is great. The opportunities that are provided are great, I &# x2019;ll be interning at s hospital next year. So as long as you stay with the right people it &# x2019;s a great school! Read  531 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; I like Chattahoochee High School ' s cultural environment! Our school is know for being the  " School of Heart "  in our area. Though we do have lots of competition, specifically in academics, we have the most school spirit out of all the schools in our area and are taught compassion and kindness. Everyone in our school is expected to respect one another and show friendship and stellar character. One thing I would like to see change in our school, however, is the resources we are given to excel in academics. Read  525 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; South Forsyth High School is amazing with their students and education. Teachers and staff care so much about the students and there are many teachers that any students can ask help for and they will always be there for you. South is very diverse and everyone is treated equally with care and we all support each other in any help. One thing I absolutely love about South is the many opportunities and experience students get to have! We have amazing field trips if you ' re in DECA, for example going of out state and also for foreign language there are a lot of amazing field trips like going to Paris or Spain!The one thing I would change about South is the school spirit. I believe that school spirit should be expressed in every event and not only football. There should be school spirit in pep rallys, soccer games, basketball games, baseball/softball games, plays, etc.  Overall I ' m lucking enough to attend South Forsyth High School and get the best high school experience. Read  542 Reviews Junior : &# xA0; North Gwinnett High School is a place where I feel safe and free to be myself. I strongly believe that I am getting the best education that I can possibly get here at North simply because the teachers here are committed to helping their student to not just simply pass/graduate high school, but to make a difference in their students &# x2019; lives for the better! One thing that I love about this school is the amount of diversity here. There are people of all sorts of racial mixes, unique ethnicities, and the best part is that they all come from different backgrounds that somehow bring people closer together, too. However, I gave NGHS four stars only because not everywhere is a perfect place and that things may happen out of the convenience of other people at the school. The large amount of school spirit here at NGHS is phenomenal in which everyone participates and supports each other, which is what being a true NGHS bulldog means! Read  809 Reviews Alum : &# xA0; I loved how engaging the staff and students are, and there really is something there for everyone! They don ' t focus on sports like many other school do, and they provide many activities and extracurriculars there. They have amazing debate, math, lacrosse, volleyball, and golf teams. They also have wonderful clubs for people who enjoy languages, art, theater, music, science and other things. Overall it was amazing, and I really enjoyed my time there! Read  732 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Overall my hs expirence was very good here! I went to JCHS for all 4 years of HS, and the environment was very conducive to learning and accelerating your studies. I was able to take very challenging classes that most schools don &# x2019;t offer. Most of the teachers were great and very helpful if you put in effort towards the classes. The school sets up students to succeed in classes. However, the school could improve in its personalization to the students. Since the school is very large, one on one advice and attention from teachers, administrators, and councilors is very limited. Read  390 Reviews Niche User : &# xA0; The teachers at the school are mostly good and very professional. They connect with the students very well and a lot offer help to the students. The school is overall clean, organized, and looks nice. The school is relatively new and very progressive. The administration of the school try to improve the way kids learn and support them in getting through high school. There are a lot of different clubs. The school offers AP classes, honors classes, student may sign up to be a mentor in a class to help out teachers and students. School also tries their best to focus on athletics and encourage physical exercise and health. However, the food at the cafeteria is mostly not a very good quality. However, I think it is an issue in a lot of schools. The school also offers a lot of different unique classes, such as British literature, Latin on all levels even a movie class for those interested in directing or filming! Overall, the school has a lot of good qualities, but could improve. Read  134 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Milton is a great school filled with academically excelling students and teachers/administrators who actually care for your well-being. The sports and arts are terrific! The Cirque program is ranked at the top in the nation and many of our sports are state champions or ranked at the top of the state.  There are numerous club at school so you will definitely be able to find what you enjoy. If not, it is easy to start your own club too. However, the school culture absolutely sucks with a plethora of stuck-up materialistic children feeding off their parents '  wealth. Along with this, around 50% of these students do drugs or vape blatantly in front of teachers in lower level classes. Read  435 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Brookwood is different from any other school I ' ve heard compared to the Gwinnett district. What I love about this school is the endless opportunities they offer. They provide many clubs and academics, especially the APs. They work every year to improve their school for the comfort of students. The school has shown off their records and not afraid to show their trophy display. (Which is kind of obnoxious but impressive to say the least) Additionally, administration can be both professional and friendly. They do what ' s best for students while befriends them at the same time. Brookwood is also known for their football. The students here have crazy spirit, I ' ve never seen anything like it. The stadiums would be packed on those Friday nights. People would skip doing their homework or any other activity just to attend their games. The support is unreal here. Go Broncos! Read  1,006 Reviews Alum : &# xA0; McIntosh was an incredible preparation for the realistic amount of work-load and real-world experiences that college will bring. The rigorous courses provided were indeed a plus. The opportunities available to partake in multiple types of dual-enrollment and AP courses were great! I would highly recommend this school, in all honesty, for realistic exceptions of life in college, and superb academics. Read  369 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Opportunity, diversity, inclusion and rigorous academics describe Chamblee Charter High School.  Since 9th grade I have strived to compete with classmates form varying backgrounds and claim my place in bulldog history.  In additional to competition, our teachers promote inclusion and collaboration.  Thorough my experiences I know that one day I will become a self-sufficient productive member of society. The only change I would make about my school would be to provide more access to students who are not able to attend due to the attendance lottery.  All students deserve an opportunity for great teaching and learning! Read  543 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Roswell has been a great school overall. The three biggest problems are drug use, poor restrooms despite the renovation, and low levels of club participation. In recent years the students have started vaping in bathrooms throughout the school day. There aren ' t enough female cafeteria monitors, so admin has decided to just lock the cafeteria bathrooms completely. Speaking of bathrooms, a few of the female restrooms don ' t have trashcans in them, so the bathrooms have gotten just as disgusting as they were before the renovation in just a few months. Clubs also usually just fizzle out after a couple of meetings; students aren ' t interested or just don ' t care. Despite these issues, the school is generally a great place with helpful teachers, awesome athletic teams and arts programs, and lots of encouragement from faculty and staff to improve the school. Read  448 Reviews Junior : &# xA0; Over my two years I have completed in Buford High School, I have not encountered a single thing I did not simply love. So far, all of my teachers have treated me with upmost respect and have been there to help me in any area that I need. Not only are the academics amazing, but I am involved in high school baseball, and the athletics department are to die for. As they say at Buford  &# x201C;Triple A excellence: Academics, Atheletics, And Arts &# x201D;. Until I reached my freshman year, I did not understand how accurate this statement was. Overall, I have loved my experiences at Buford High school so far and can &# x2019;t wait to see what the future has to offer! Read  230 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Lassiter High school is a wonderful school.  There are copious amounts of opportunities for students of all kind.  Whether one has a learning disability, special needs, or the just the average student, Lassiter caters to all student needs.  From pep rallies to every club you can think of, Lassiter has it.  LOL, Languages of Lassiter, is a club for all students to learn and engulf themselves into different cultures through food!  This is just one of many inclusive clubs, They offer Gay-Straight-Alliance club, DECA, NHS, and more! The faculty does a great job of helping students with different learning styles and offering help/study sessions. Read  492 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; I love the culture at Peachtree Ridge High School. It is extremely diversified compared to other schools in the county, and there is a niche for every student. Our AP teachers prepare us well for exams, as well as honors teachers. With block scheduling, we receive extra class time that others schools don ' t. Thus, we are better prepared for exams. Furthermore, block scheduling allows students to focus only on four classes at a time, as opposed to seven or eight.  I feel extremely safe at Peachtree Ridge; the doors are locked at all times. Although our sports and food could be improved, I ' m grateful that safety is always our administrators '  first priority.  Although I ' m interested in the English pathway, Peachtree Ridge offers an excellent STEM pathway, which features engineering. I am honored be a student at such an innovative school. Read  820 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; I am currently a senior at Savannah Arts and I love it. I transferred in after freshman year and it was a super smooth and easy process. All the teachers are amazing and super helpful. The administration and counselors provide the best resources and help to make sure you succeed. Although a visual and performing arts school, Savannah Arts is very academically challenging, but provides a healthy competitive environment for its students. The students are extremely progressive, forward thinking, and open minded. Savannah Arts instills skills and lessons into it students that will help them throughout your life. I am sad to leave, but extremely excited to use what I learned here in my college career. Read  573 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Decatur High School is a tight-knit community of hard-working students, teachers, administrators, and staff. Everyone has their different interests, passions, and talents, and they are all welcomed, respected, and encouraged at DHS. The school ' s Science Olympiad team, for example, is an amazing opportunity for students interested in STEM to learn more about fascinating, real-world topics relating to STEM. DHS also offers a variety of quirky clubs, from LARPing club to birdwatching club to telenovela club. Read  298 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Davidson Fine Arts is a school where one can discover themselves within their studies, their teachers, and any of the various talents one possesses. I &# x2019;ve attended Davidson since the 6th grade and I am now a senior. Throughout my entire Davidson life I can say that the staff and administration have our best interest, they &# x2019;re constantly motivating us and improving the learning environments. The school itself is a home to me because in every area of the school I have a confidant. Their academics are rigorous yet intriguing. The teaching techniques in which each teacher has is what makes it such a unique and fulfilling experience. There &# x2019;s no other school like Davidson because at Davidson everyone has a role and no matter one &# x2019;s individual goal the overall goal to achieve at the end of each day is the bettering of one another. Read  355 Reviews Alum : &# xA0; Dekalb School of the Arts taught me how to plan effectively and utilize time management properly. Since Dekalb School of the Arts also has a unique arts program it forces you to have to learn how to balance both the high academic workload of a high-school, and the devotion to practicing an artistic craft. So, overall I think Dekalb School of the Arts does prepare students well for life after high-school by requiring students to develop skills like patience, discipline, adaption, communication skills, and time management. But one thing that Dekalb School of the Arts fails at is strengthening students academic weaknesses. Since the school is not as big as majority of the high schools in the state, there should be more time put into personally helping out each student individually and helping them fill in the academic holes that have been left from previous school experience. Even though the school is an arts school there should be equal effort put into academics as well. Read  164 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Parkview High School is an extremely preparing facility. Objectively one of the overall best high schools in the state of Georgia. A very large facility, a relatively welcoming staff and plenty of different school cultures to get involved with. Most schools don &# x2019;t give you this feeling of wholesomeness that parkview does. The grand scale of what it has to offer for its students make the surrounding schools pale in comparison.Go View! Read  667 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Wheeler high school is an outstanding school. The teachers at Wheeler high school are excellent! They make sure no student is left behind in class and offer many different types of tutoring sessions.The students are all very uplifting to one another and wish success to all their peers. The schools diversity teaches other students how to respect each others cultures, race and religions. The school even offers international night where the students get to try things from all over the world. Wheeler high school isn ' t like another school which is why I believe every student graduates with a knowledge on just about everything, and is ready for the real world ahead of them. Read  422 Reviews Junior : &# xA0; I love the sense of community and small class sizes! Town meetings every Monday morning are really fun. There ' s lots of time to do work, like during conference and X-Block. Advisories are a great way to make friends and talk to the same group of people for all four years. Freshman retreat is very fun. The academics are challenging, but if you ' re a motivated student it ' s very valuable. Read  68 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Having been in public schools throughout Middle School, Quarry Lane has been a stellar, eye-opening high school experience for me. It has given me the opportunities to push myself academically and grow among intellectuals who also want to be successful individuals in their communities. The faculty and teachers are really supportive, from helping understand concepts in class to just being nice people to talk to about things outside of school, such as movies, music, sports, etc. The smaller grade sizes have also allowed for lots of independent clubs to flourish. Students who are passionate about their goals can achieve almost anything they set their minds to at Quarry Lane. Thanks to the open minded and generous community here at Quarry Lane, I have been able to explore numerous leadership positions in clubs while also building a solid educational foundation to prepare for college.
