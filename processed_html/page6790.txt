Mail Exchange Hotel | Melbourne Pub  &  Restaurant Established on the land of Sir Robert Hoddle, first surveyor of Melbourne, the Mail Exchange Hotel is one of the city’s best storytellers. Once Melbourne’s iconic Mail Centre, you’ll enjoy this heritage-listed building which has undergone many transformations over the past century. But thankfully, it’s still embedded with pieces from the past, including its original vault doors. Our building has thrived throughout the years, bringing joy to people like you – generation after generation. Working professionals. Frequent travellers. Fanatic footy lovers. The Mail Exchange Hotel makes everyone feel at home.
