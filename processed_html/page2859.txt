The Stayner Hitmen peewee squad are provincial champions. The team won the  D  division during the Ontario Lacrosse Association championships in Whitby, July 31, with a 5-3 win over Midland. It has been a fantastic year,  said team manager Bob Webb, adding the championship caps off a season that also saw the squad winning the Stayner Fair Play Tournament, the first time a Stayner team has won their own tournament. In winning the provincials, the team defeated a Midland squad they had already split a home-and-home series with during the regular season. To get there, the team   sponsored by Signature Sold   went unbeaten in six games over three days, placing first in their pool with wins over Clarington, Simcoe, and Brantford. In a single elimination game, with the winner moving on to the semifinals, Stayner shutout Kitchener-Waterloo, 4-0. In the semi, the peewees defeated Northumberland, 11-7. The Hitmen s netminder Carter Webb was the tournament s most valuable player, with a goals-against average of 3.2 and a shutout. The team s top goal scorers during the championships were Jack Foubert with 12, and Sean McMahon with 11. However, said Webb, the entire team contributed to the team s success. Will Millington, who is one of our smaller boys, found another gear and the other teams could not stop him; he had three Goals. He was a living pinball,  Webb said. Webb said other players of note included Ethan Viscomi, Robbie Butwell, and the lone female on the team, Haley Beckett, who scored the go-ahead goal in the final Webb said the team s ranking for all of Ontario went from 81st in 2015, to 49th this year. It took the entire team to achieve this accomplishment,  he said. Register now to support your local journalism!
