native javascript get browser width after resize then run a function stack overflow by using our site you acknowledge that you have read and understand our cookie policy privacy policy and our terms of service this question already has an answer here i have this program i am building where the content loads based on the window width on page load it functions normally with the correct html and css attached but when i resize the page my ajax makes too many calls to load the appropriate sheets causing the content to flicker annoyingly there seems to be ten thousand answers for jquery but none for native javascript i have deducted from many of these questions and answers on so that a timeout is needed to get one value on the completion of the resize function but.. to no avail even with the timeout it still makes rapid calls to ajax this is what i have worked out so far this works fine on page load the correct scripts fall into place but when i resize the browser in console.log it makes an abundance of calls making the page flicker drastically as per the jquery solutions i tried several ways to get one value from window.onresize still i could not get a single value but persistent calls what i have tried from what i read was to comment out window.onresize layouthandler and move layouthandler to the bottom of the body then tried this even with the timeout it still reacts to every pixel increase with a call to the function except for the page flickering with all the calls this works perfect if i could get a single value after the resize event my issue would be solved looking for a native javascript solution suggestion ty in advance this question has been asked before and already has an answer if those answers do not fully address your question please ask a new question try this 2019 stack exchange inc
