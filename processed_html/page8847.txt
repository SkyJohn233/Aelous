1257AD become Faction Leader? : mountandblade Just installed 1257 AD and was hoping to play up in the British isles, I always enjoy Scotland in these games.  Is it possible to become faction leader of an existing faction, Scotland for example?  Or do you have to start you own faction to become king? Bonnie King Jonass of the TRUE SCOTSMEN, OCH AYE LADDIE I like your enthusiasm You can &# x27;t take over an existing faction in 1257AD, which is a shame You  can  start out as a faction leader in the Medieval Conquests mod, which is meant to be a successor to the 1257 mod, but some people reckon it &# x27;s even more unstable than 1257, so that might be a problem. I haven &# x27;t really had much trouble with it, personally, but I might just be lucky. Too bad would be fun to take over a faction. Thanks for the insight It &# x27;s definitely more unstable than 1257, and it &# x27;s dev has abandoned it. Some gamebreaking bugs involving kingdom diplomacy and companions. It &# x27;s a huge shame because all of the additions would be awesome if they worked. 106k Members 362 Online Jun 3, 2009 Cake Day
