Symphoniker Hamburg © J. Konrad Schmidt Laeiszhalle Hamburg  Großer Saal Thu, 28 Mar 2019 19:30 »Liebeserklärungen« / »Declarations of Love« Music as an affair of the heart: newly married, Richard Wagner composed »Siegfried Idyll« as a birthday present for his Cosima. The work was named after the couple’s son and was first performed in the family’s stairwell. An equally idyllic sound landscape features in Haydn’s Horn Concerto, in which the conductor Alessio Allegrini performs as a virtuosic soloist. Lastly, Beethoven’s Fourth Symphony is a feast of wonderful melodies. No surprise, perhaps, considering that he was madly in love at the time. One of his contemporaries noted: »When he was writing this symphony, his heart must have been close to bursting with joy.« Symphoniker Hamburg Alessio Allegrini  french horn Richard Wagner Siegfried-Idyll Joseph Haydn Hornkonzert D-Dur - Pause -  Ludwig van Beethoven Sinfonie Nr. 4 B-Dur op. 60 Pre-Concert Talk                 18:30 / Laeiszhalle Hamburg, Studio E     Promoter: Symphoniker Hamburg Laeiszhalle Along with a wide range of food options, a large and changing selection of wines and the perfect delicacies to go with them are on offer before events and during the interval.
