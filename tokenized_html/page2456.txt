osian sand dunes you can skip in jodhpur my simple sojourn jodhpur is full of history and have spectacular monuments like mehrangarh fort and jaswant thada other then these main attractions there are some places around jodhpur which are recomended for half day excursions i.e visit to bisnoi village and village safari or visit to osian sand dunes osian sand dunes are around 70 km from the jodhpur city and i booked a cab to visit though i had visited these before approx 15 yrs back but i decded to visit these again as i have some free time moreover it was recomended a lot and have good reviews so i thought maybe something interesting developed over the years but alas it was more boring and dull place than i remebered the osian sand dune tour includes two old temples also which is more of a marketing thing if you are religious and like to visit temples than it s a different thing else don t fall for it go only if you have nothing else to do and just want to kill time spend some money ðŸ˜‰ now i come to the reasons why you can avoid going there drive is long and boring as nothing interesting on the way skip it ..until and unless you are a religious person who likes to visit all temples osian is a small to mid range dune with shrubs here and there its area is quite small and not clean skip it if you are not crazy to ride a camel as you never rode a camel before if you have any plans to visit jaisalmer in near or distant future then definitely skip it there are no proper restaurants and restrooms in the area it will cost you somewhere around 1800 inr with nothing interesting to see or experience my first visit to jodhpur blue city of india was more than 18 years back with a group of friends from delhi those days google was not used for research we use to refer to guidebooks and ask hotel s front what are the best places to visit in jodhpur goneâ€¦ in india jaisalmer is also known as the golden city of india because its monuments and most of the houses in the city are made of yellow sand stone it is an old city and the main architect attraction is forts and havelis winter months are the best time to visit jaisalmerâ€¦ in india india has a lot to offer in terms of monuments forts history and rich heritage there are many unique places in india from ladakh to kanyakumari and gujarat to seven sisters in the northeast of india every place has something special to showcase our culture is diverse and that s whatâ€¦ in india this site uses akismet to reduce spam learn how your comment data is processed i have been to osian three or four times its not at all a tourist spot i have visited temple on all three occasions it s quite rustic and only foreigners looking for offbeat experience will like it i been to osian twice there are many beautiful temples in rajasthan in comparison to these the mata mandir except for main sanctum is a new construction and all gates are marked with names of the people who donated these the jain temple is made nicely but again from a traveller s point of view is it worth travelling that much it is a small temple and the guy standing outside temple forces you to buy 100 rs ticket for camera i gave my views as point of a traveller and not a devote because then the perspective changes you are right sapna i will agree that all new construction around main sanctum is nothing great to talk about so for a traveller or tourist there s nothing much here except the stories related to the osian mata and its temple great captures sapna thanks yes it is a bit hyped up function d var f d.getelementsbytagname 'script 0 p d.createelement 'script p.type 'text/javascript p.async true p.src '//widgets.wp.com/platform.js f.parentnode.insertbefore p f document enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email email address subscribe
