janardan yri about janardan blah blah etc about janardan blah blah etc your custom text here my work includes ux- and analytics-driven ios apps innovative websites and apis in rails node.js and php well-architected sql databases scaling to millions of rows desktop and low-level services mentoring people and assembling teams to accomplish the same when i arrived omni s app was stuck in a year-long total rewrite i led the completion of the rewrite helped ship nine updates and designed new features along the way when hired decided to build a mobile team they brought me in to train their existing engineers source additional engineers and code alongside them we went from scratch to shipping hired for employers asana s original mobile app was a native-wrapped webview bursting at the seams i came in as the first mobile engineer we rebuilt the app from scratch fully native with a new design and the new asana api i was founding engineer of the startup sol health we prototyped a few unique cbt-based apps and ultimately shipped choir an av-card-based-experience app designed to reduce stress and spark inspiration all technical work was mine my technical work included a multi-threaded core data stack with persistent caches and drafts entirely custom ui and the specifications and implementations for the supporting api and database i built an iphone app implementing the cognitive enhancement game dual n-back praeco was a group communication iphone app i came in partway through the project and provided supporting development work to accelerate progress toward completion i built a c service for onvisource that collated email from various sources and heuristically alerted customers of high-priority incoming content i wrote the backend for choir with node.js and postgresql i wrote software for onvisource that automatically navigated ibm terminal systems collected relevant data from their character-based interfaces and converted it into a modern sql database this was a hobby labor of love and therefore wildly overengineered and i 'm very proud of it written in php/mysql this was a competition website which centered on user-submitted statistics with multiple complex derived sets of data amounting to millions of rows in sql plus custom integration between my code and the third-party forum and registration software a comprehensive and flexible custom html theming engine a database-driven nested request routing structure a lightweight cms heuristic/rule-based cheat detection algorithms and it 's still online 14 years later i helped maintain and extend the triplebyte rails-based web platform with new behind-the-scenes supporting capabilities i maintained these php-based shopping websites extending their ability to handle new types of products i was half of the team on this project for delta-v instruments with an interface program written in vb.net and low-level driver software in c++ these chambers controlled temperature and voltage fluctuations for testing i wrote website scraping scripts in a consulting capacity for screen-scraper clients i reverse engineered videogames on various 8-bit and 16-bit platforms to do things like extract maps uncover compression algorithms and derive formulae back when software was written in assembly software shipped under a megabyte and browsing in a hex editor or disassembly was a reasonable way to get a feel for the area those were the days as the engineering track co-lead i helped students transition into tech careers while learning swift and javascript and doing real work for real companies as a hackbright mentor i formally met with students once a week to help guide their careers and provide context and feedback on their program work and interviewing in addition to informal assistance contact me
