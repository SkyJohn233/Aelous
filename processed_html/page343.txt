Although your eyes may look and feel normal with these diseases, they can often lead to serious complications such as hemorrhaging and blindness. Lasers have been used to treat eye diseases for over 30 years and produce effective results with no damage to surrounding tissue and no need for needles. It has quickly become the standard for eye disease treatment. Laser surgery can be used to treat diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusions, age-related macular degeneration, retinal detachments and more. Depending on the patient’s condition, the laser may be used to seal leaking blood vessels, repair tears, remove newly formed blood vessels or destroy tumors. These procedures are performed in the doctor’s office and require only anesthetic eye drops to numb the area prior to treatment. Laser treatment usually takes less than 30 minutes to perform, and patients can go home immediately following surgery. Most patients return to work and other normal activities the next day.
