3315 gene resulthspb1 heat shock protein family b small member 1 human gene id 3315 updated on 10-dec-2019 this gene encodes a member of the small heat shock protein hsp20 family of proteins in response to environmental stress the encoded protein translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a molecular chaperone that promotes the correct folding of other proteins this protein plays an important role in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types expression of this gene is correlated with poor clinical outcome in multiple human cancers and the encoded protein may promote cancer cell proliferation and metastasis while protecting cancer cells from apoptosis mutations in this gene have been identified in human patients with charcot-marie-tooth disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy provided by refseq aug 2017 heat shock protein beta-1 28 kda heat shock protein epididymis secretory protein li 102 estrogen-regulated 24 kda protein heat shock 27 kda protein heat shock 27kd protein 1 heat shock 27kda protein 1 stress-responsive protein 27
