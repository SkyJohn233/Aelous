The Conversion Bureau: Not Alone (Fanfic) - TV Tropes Follow TV Tropes http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheConversionBureauNotAlone Go To The Conversion Bureau: Not Alone  is a  My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic  fanfic. It is a sometimes heavy-handed and different take on  The Conversion Bureau ; while not strictly necessary, reading or at least having knowledge of TCB is  strongly advised . Similar to mainline TCB, the Equestrian landmass appears suddenly in the South Atlantic. While humanity extended a (cautious) welcome to the ponies, there were those who had doubts. These doubts proved founded once the ponies' imperialism came to light, leading humanity to gear up for war. At the same time, there are also those ponies who disagree with the Princesses' actions. The story is presented through newscasts, postings and other formats in addition to standard prose. Dalek IX, author of the fanfictions  A Hero  and  Friends of a Solar Empire , is writing a fan sequel to  Not Alone , called  Conquer The Stars . That story takes place 200 years later on a colony ship that has rediscovered the Equestrian Barrier... in an entirely different star system. Much of the original's open ending is expanded upon, both on Earth and in Equestria. As of January 31, 2013, Starman Ghost decided to delete the story from  Fimfiction.Net , declaring that he refused to write in the Conversion Bureau setting anymore, to the shock of his readers, who did their level best to convince him otherwise. However, readers uploaded the story (with his permission) to other places, including the Spacebattles link above. A second fan sequel has been posted to  Fimfiction.Net  by another fimfiction author called Warwolf, with Starman's permission, as of February 11, 2013 called  The Shadow of Ages , and is also a crossover with another Conversion Bureau fanfic called  The Conversion Bureau: The Warrior's Way , itself a sequel to Warwolf's story  The Shogun Six .  The Shadow of Ages  can be found  here .
