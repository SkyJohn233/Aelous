to ask this sort of question is on the hubb as this is a users blog they may respond or they may not whereas on the hubb lots of people wll see your post my answer is pretty simple to your question just take the main roads any crossing is fine there is no reason to be greatly concerned plan the most direct route and enjoy mexico is a wonderful country beautiful town not much into cities but this is real nice most of the streets are narrow with lots of small shops and street vendors selling things to eat and drink my favorite way to eat found a few nice cantina 's the road from guanajuato to the coast was a great ride stopped in autlan de navarro along the way for the night scenario one way street two lanes no traffic i 'm in front of the hotel as close to the curb as i can get a woman in a mini van pulls behind me and stops she then starts honking her horn i motion for her to go around no she pulls up closer to the bike and honks the horn again no other traffic two lanes she is now to close to go around so i move the bike forward and motion for her to go around again may 27 2013 visitied chichen itza today quite impressive it was on my bucket list 16 photo 's staying in the town of piste one kilometer away from the site not much going on here the lady that owns the place is an american from the pittsburg area her father built the place 45 years ago and she came down to help out and he died and she stayed they stop selling beer at the oxxo store at 9 pm no good having a little trouble getting photo 's to upload into picasa it requires a good internet connection and i 'm finding that a bit difficult to find making blog entries has been the most challenging part of the trip so far excuse the mix of past present or future tense mixed together crossed into belize on may 29 2013 simple procedure they wanted to see passport copies of bike title and registration other than a weeks worth of insurance 14.50 us there are no other expenses planned on stopping in beize city however when i got there it did n't look very inviting it was a great day for riding so i kept going ended up in san ignacio i was here back in '07 with my brother and decided to stop it 's touristy place lots of young americans just hanging out lots of crunchy 's entries are in reverse order but i 'm going with it i have internet that works well sometimes may 31 2013 got up early and headed for guatemala the border is 11 miles from san ignacio so i arrived before much was going on departing belize is a pretty simple process pay 37.50 belize departing tax turn in the bike permit and get a couple stamps entering guatemala is also a simple process however the border agents are in no hurry at all spent the day walking around exploring the city it was very overcast this morning i was hoping to see the top of the volcano but it kept hidden most of the day going to put the captions first and then the photo and see how that looks still getting the kinks out i spent the day just riding slow on back roads and meeting people did n't take many photo 's just rode and visited the weather was very hit or miss and i had to stop because of rain often it was still a great day for riding when i stop i often get out my map and start asking directions even if i know where i am and where i 'm going everyone seems to like being involved and i usually get some good information jun 07 2013 june 10 2013 still in el tunco hanging out been meeting a lot of travelers doing the bus/back pack thing it 's fun sharing travel stories and learning about places to visit not sure how much longer i 'll be here but plan on heading to honduras soon i 'll do one more stop before the border and get a couple day plan together finally washed my riding gear today damn it was dirty song of the day end of the line traveling wilburys jun 17 2013 did n't sleep much last night and was up early this morning was n't doing so well as good things happen the lady that owns the hotel speaks good english and has a private doctor that comes to the hotel for her and the guests when needed 20 minutes later the doc arrives diagnosed with an inner ear infection and a prescription is written i 've had this before so i suspected that 's what was going on started feeling better within a few hours and managed to get out and take some pictures i 'll probably hang out for another day or two to make sure everything is good was feeling pretty good this morning and decided to head for san juan del sur it 's was a short ride so i went pretty slow and stopped a few times to visit and for the rain anyone heading south has to take this road and it looks like they keep it nice along here everything was clean and the road sides were well kept song of the day good feeling flo rida jun 18 2013 met up with montazuma today and he was one pissed off aztec spent a good part of the day apologizing what makes me so angry is the fact i did n't do anything to the bastard no photo 's june 23 2013 great
