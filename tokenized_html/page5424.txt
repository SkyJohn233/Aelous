cuddles not bombs how one woman helped children in syria life and style the guardian focusing on the quality of family life in a war zone may seem futile but one woman is doing just that juliet rix meets aala el-khani who is reaching out to traumatised parents trapped on the frontline in order to help thousands of children focusing on the quality of family life in a war zone may seem futile but one woman is doing just that juliet rix meets aala el-khani who is reaching out to traumatised parents trapped on the frontline in order to help thousands of children sat 7 jan 2017 01.00 est last modified on sat 14 apr 2018 13.55 edt f atima a jolly-looking woman in a sparkly grey jumper and tightly wrapped headscarf that accentuates her round smiley face laughs as she shows me into her living room in manchester which is comfortable even though the family moved in just a fortnight ago she offers me nuts and biscuits but then her demeanour changes she shifts in her chair the laugh is gone she looks down she starts to talk about her life in syria we moved and moved she says trying to find somewhere safe but each time the bombing was as bad as before. by the end she says they were semi-conscious living only in that they were not dead we forgot everything we forgot our kids all we could think was that we did not want to die she says i will never forget the airstrikes the children were terrified … and the things they saw … their grandfather s dead body after he had been tortured … their uncle taken away with his t-shirt over his head he has not been seen since … the house hit by a barrel bomb we were out but the neighbour and her child were killed. fatima s daughter became racked with fear her son a shadow of his former self so when newly arrived in manchester two years ago she was approached and asked to help with a parenting project that would be delivered to syrian families still in conflict zones and camps she leapt at the opportunity it was perfect timing she says finally we were safe and i could focus on the children. but would parenting advice have been any use to her in the dark days in syria yes she says without hesitation if i had been reminded what i should be doing taught how to help … oh yes. the woman behind the project is aala el-khani she is sitting with us translating fatima s arabic el-khani mother of two young children and a parenting trainer had just started a phd in psychology at the university of manchester when the syrian conflict began el-khani s parents are syrian and although she was born and raised in the uk she still has family there her husband ammar an nhs surgeon and also of syrian descent was soon travelling regularly to syria with humanitarian organisations such as the david nott foundation returning numb with stories and photographs one picture was of a little boy who looked so sad she says his father had been killed his mother was caring for her two children and her elderly parents my husband was staying with colleagues in the bottom of the building one morning they heard screaming and rushed out the mother had gone in a taxi to buy bread and been shot by a sniper they couldn t save her … i just kept thinking about that little boy that could have been my son – or yours. aid to syria and to the refugee camps focuses on primary needs – food shelter medical supplies but watching the horrors in syria unfold night after night on television el-khani kept thinking about the children how would her two children be changed if they had such experiences how would she cope if faced with them seeing such things mental health she says is as important as physical health and research confirms that family support has a big psychological impact on a child s wellbeing one study found that the quality of family relationships was a better predictor of children s mental wellbeing than their wartime experiences if warm secure parenting – or caregiving – could be that powerfully protective thought el-khani then help to achieve it must be delivered to those who needed it most she changed her phd subject to exploring ways to support families and children in the war zone and nearby refugee camps and headed out to syria and turkey to talk to refugee parents every parent i met was struggling with emotional or behavioural changes in their children. some had gone looking for advice asking camp doctors teachers and ngos but these people were too overwhelmed with their own roles or didn t have the knowledge to help back in the uk el-khani worked with rachel calam professor of child and family psychology at the university of manchester and psychologist dr kim cartwright to produce a leaflet explaining to parents that bedwetting nightmares withdrawal and even aggression are normal responses to childhood trauma and offering basic reminders and suggestions for looking after themselves and their children when you become focused on survival says el-khani you forget to praise your children play cuddle or talk to them. one young mother after meeting el-khani later told her she had gone back to her tent and read her child a bedtime story for the first time since arriving in the camp to test the leaflet el-khani and her colleagues recruited a group of recently arrived syrian refugee parents in manchester including fatima they read and approved the leaflet but how was it to be distributed on almost no budget to thousands of families in a chaotic environment an ngo worker had the answer this psychological first aid should be delivered with the refugees bread two sheets of paper the leaflet and a feedback form and a pen were tucked inside the wrappers of 3,000 flatbreads and delivered to families and caregivers in northern syria sixty per cent responded a high figure anywhere let alone in a conflict zone el-khani remembers the excitement of opening the feedback forms more than 80 of those displaced families who responded said the leaflet was useful 400 had added comments most were positive remarks about the leaflet some were prayers for better times others asked for more information particularly about bereavement and anxiety the leaflet had hit a nerve when you become focused on survival you forget to praise your children play cuddle or talk to them so the manchester team has put the leaflet online in english and arabic for anyone to use and distribute along with a version in various languages adapted to refugees already in europe when a swedish version was put on the swedish health website it was downloaded 343 times in the first 45 minutes the largest response the website has ever had the leaflet has just been translated into urdu and pashto and is about to be distributed with newspapers in pakistan with the hope that it will reach more than a million families taking on board the syrian refugees requests for more information an expanded booklet and two-hour seminar will be trialled with syrian refugees in europe this year and the manchester team is also working on a new version of an established evidence-based programme for children with post-traumatic stress disorder teaching recovery techniques created by the british-norwegian charity children and war has been used successfully with children who have faced traumatic situations from war zones to the zeebrugge ferry disaster el-khani and her team have created a five-week course for children and carers and piloted it successfully in a school for refugee children in turkey all 13 eligible families attended every session and the results showed significant improvements in the children s wellbeing and behaviour we are developing video and skype training that will allow us to reach many more families in places we can not visit says el-khani the primary purpose of this work is to help the families but she points out it is also in the interests of their host countries without help children with psychological problems become adults with problems fatima is cheerful as we collect her children from school ten-year-old khalid and nine-year-old mariam skip and jump ahead they like school and have made friends khalid is slight and considered mariam bubbly chattering away in a mix of english and arabic back at home the children are asked to tell me what they remember of syria khalid claims not to recall that he used to recognise all the different threats from the sky by their sound mariam however points straight to the scar across her arm and tells me haltingly how she was hit by a car in post-airstrike chaos and nearly died she mentions a dead aunt and the dangers of going outside then a minor family disagreement leaves her suddenly tense she puts her face in her hands and freezes before bursting into disproportionate tears el-khani hugs her and her mother says simply she remembered something. with both children smiling once more we tuck into a selection of syrian flatbreads fatima is pleased to be able to help el-khani in her work believing parenting advice – in a bread wrapper or by any other means – would have made things just a little less awful for her and her children it would have changed the way i was with them we needed it. the children are recovering now she says we have a life again not just a lack of death. some names have been changed • the leaflet and more information about the manchester group s work can be found at research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/pfrg/resources … in the coming year and the results will define the country for a generation democracy is under attack as is civility truth and normal forms of political behaviour the white house harbours white nationalists incites fear and prejudice undermines intelligence agencies courts foreign influence in us elections and undermines the judiciary the need for a robust independent press has never been greater and with your help we can continue to provide fact-based reporting that offers public scrutiny and oversight these are perilous times the administration s willingness to deploy untruths violent speech and hateful attacks on the media are now commonplace this is why we are asking for your help so that we can continue to put truth and civility at the heart of the public discourse. next year america faces an epic choice – and the result could define the country for a generation it is at a tipping point finely balanced between truth and lies hope and hate civility and nastiness many vital aspects of american public life are in play – the supreme court abortion rights climate policy wealth inequality big tech and much more the stakes could hardly be higher as that choice nears the guardian as it has done for 200 years and with your continued support will continue to argue for the values we hold dear – facts science diversity equality and fairness. – us editor john mulholland on the occasion of its 100th birthday in 1921 the editor of the guardian said perhaps the chief virtue of a newspaper is its independence it should have a soul of its own. that is more true than ever freed from the influence of an owner or shareholders the guardian s robust independence is our unique driving force and guiding principle we also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the guardian in 2019 you provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do we hope to surpass our goal by early january every contribution big or small will help us reach it make a year-end gift from as little as 1 thank you sign in or create your guardian account to join the

government children are the future so this is really important work thank you for doing it so long as the work being done does not enter the realms of political affiliation then i think it is an excellent initiative which would probably meet the criteria for national lottery funding i wonder if thought has been given to that remarkable just imagine the difference that efforts like these can make the children concerned it s so wonderful that people like you are out there doing this the good you re doing can not be underestimated just lovely what beautiful heart-led service bless all that
