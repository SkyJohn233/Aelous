Wow…what a great job these guys did on following thru and purchasing my house in Glendale, AZ! I initially got a call from Brian wanting to discuss some offer options for my house. I had it rented but tenants moved out and didn’t leave it in great condition. I knew I had to fix it, maintain it, pay the bills and wait 3-4 months with a Realtor waiting for a buyer. So, I was really happy with the fair cash offer Paul discussed with me in our appointment. The crazy thing is that they were able to give me the higher price I wanted in the end WITHOUT re-negotiation. We discussed that there could be an issue getting a higher price due to the house situation. But, in the end, they closed in a couple weeks (sooner than I wanted initially), paid CASH and did NOT ask for a lower price. I would definitely recommend the AZ Home Seller Solutions team to anyone looking to sell their property quickly. They also closed in TWO WEEKS and paid all costs as agreed I just wanted to note how happy I was with Rafael, Paul, Brian and the rest of the AZ Home Seller Solutions Team. When my kids moved out of our condo in Mesa, I knew we had to do something with it right away due to it being vacant and needing some work. We didn’t want to end up renting it and didn’t necessarily want to take on a full fixup project. Brian and Paul reached out with interest in purchasing and I decided to meet with them to discuss offer options. In the end, I accepted a fair CASH offer and they offered to pay all closing costs! They also closed in TWO WEEKS and paid all costs as agreed. There were no hiccups or issues throughout the process and it happened pretty quickly. I would recommend the AZ Home Seller Solutions team to anyone looking to sell quickly, AS-IS and for Cash. not once did they ask for a price reduction or a change in our initial agreed upon terms. I was so impressed with Rafael, Paul and the rest of the AZ Home Seller Solutions Team that I wanted to write them a quick testimonial. I initially reached out to them thru their website considering they had numerous testimonials from other sellers and offered great initial information. I saw that they had some great credibility as well as experience in buying  &  selling properties quickly and for cash. I submitted my info and property details thru their website and they responded very quickly. I requested for them to send me some offer options I can review and decide over. They did just that within a couple days and I was impressed with their multiple-offer options package! All in all, I decided to accept their quick-close CASH offer. I was most impressed with how patient and diligent they were to wait over 3 months to purchase my property due to certain title issues that had to be cleared out beforehand.  Rafael was even able to provide a detailed BPO property report to help clear the final issues and move us to final closing.  So, after 3 months of closing setbacks that were out of our control, Rafael and his team were still able to purchase my property for CASH and closed immediately after we were given the green light. And not once did they ask for a price reduction or a change in our initial agreed upon terms. I would highly recommend the AZ Home Seller Solutions team to anyone needing true solutions for anything Real Estate related.
