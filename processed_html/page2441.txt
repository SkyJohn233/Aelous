On the same day, the National Hurricane Center  downgraded  Hurricane Isaac to tropical storm status at 2:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time. NASA is just days from launching an intensive multi-year study of hurricane formation and evolution in the Atlantic Ocean. Known as the  Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel  (HS3) mission, the project will use robotic  Global Hawk  airplanes to fly over and through storm systems. A principal goal is to learn more about what makes tropical storms intensify into hurricanes. Read a more detailed description of Isaac from the satellite view at NASA s  Hurricane Resource Page.  Also, the National Hurricane Center provides the official U.S. storm forecasts and regular updates on conditions on  its home page. NASA image by Jeff Schmaltz,  LANCE/EOSDIS Rapid Response.
