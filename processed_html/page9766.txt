Rental Valuations  &  Determination | Bertacco Ferrier Pty Ltd Are you a tenant or landlord having difficulty in negotiating or establishing a market rent? Bertacco Ferrier has extensive experience in the analysis of market evidence and determining a reasonable rental value for your property or occupancy. Rental determinations can help avoid costly litigation and delays, and it is therefore vital to obtain independent advice from industry specialists who are fully cognisant of relevant legislation impacting this sector. We assess your property with an in-depth understanding of the two major principles of market rent: the Retail Leases Act 2003 and Landlord  &  Tenant Act 1958. Consumer legislation of the relevant state must also be considered. The assessment of your property through an independent rental valuation is critical, as an understanding of market dynamics is essential to reaching a figure that is fair and agreed upon by both parties. We are engaged to conduct rental determinations for multiple city and suburban property classes, including retail, industrial warehouses and office buildings. Bertacco Ferrier Property Valuers have a team of qualified staff that have completed the Specialist Retail Valuer course commissioned by the Australian Property Institute. We have extensive experience in the analysis of market evidence and determining a reasonable rental value for your property or occupancy.
