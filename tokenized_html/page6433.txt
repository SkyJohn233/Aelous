dismiss the formula uses a boolean iâ€¦ apple community looks like no one s replied in a while to start the conversation again simply ask a new question hello i am making a calculator to get price estimates for projects depending on which processes the client wants the rates for each process are added in a different table and i am using checklist buttons to turn on and off the different processes here 's an example of a formula d3 determines whether the modeling part of the project will be made thus the price will or will not be calculated if d3 is true the result will be multiplied by 1 giving me a positive amount if false the result will be multiplied by 0 giving me 0 so nothing to add to the final cost there same applies for b4 in the same formula this formula is repeated all over the chart with slight modifications for adding more complex options but it 's all the same principle everything works out fine but i got those blue triangles warning me of the formula uses a boolean instead of a number that 's fine with me i like the use of booleans and they are making my formulas work out great in my calculator how can i dismiss the blue triangles they are kind of annoying and they do n't really fit with the overall style of my calculator i 've seen someone talk about other kinds of formulas with lookup and ifs but that 's really complicated and i do n't know how to do it especially for a simple calculator ðŸ˜€ is n't there a way to just not display the warnings using version 3.6.2 on a macbook pro osx el capitan 10.11.5 thanks posted on jun 6 2016 10:51 am hi sinshassan i do n't know a way to escape your blue flags except to make a formula that conforms to what numbers expects it is not hard my formula in d2 if and d1 b2 c2,0 the if statement tests both d1 and b2 if they are both true then it shows the value in c2 your modeling :high poly carbon 1 if one or both are false unchecked then 0 is shown give it a try quinn posted on jun 6 2016 11:37 am loading page content page content loaded jun 6 2016 11:37 am in response to sinshassan in response to sinshassan hi sinshassan i do n't know a way to escape your blue flags except to make a formula that conforms to what numbers expects it is not hard my formula in d2 if and d1 b2 c2,0 the if statement tests both d1 and b2 if they are both true then it shows the value in c2 your modeling :high poly carbon 1 if one or both are false unchecked then 0 is shown give it a try quinn jun 6 2016 11:37 am jun 6 2016 11:38 am in response to t quinn in response to t quinn that 's it thank you so much jun 6 2016 11:38 am jun 6 2016 11:42 am in response to sinshassan in response to sinshassan hi sinshassan welcome to the world of formula writing thanks for the check quinn jun 6 2016 11:42 am question q dismiss the formula uses a boolean instead of a number warning more less
