The British-South African co-production, starring Idris Elba as Mandela, has earned 4.4 million rand (Â£2.6million) shattering records previously held by blockbusters like The Wolverine, Hangover 3 and some locally produced films.   South African producer Anant Singh said he was "extremely pleased with the audience reaction" and the emotional response to the two-and-a half-hour movie.

His condition has been described as critical but stable.  !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs'); Start your free 30 day Amazon Prime trial In Film news Top Galleries Film Galleries Back to top  Copyright of Telegraph Media Group Limited 2019 Terms and Conditions Today's News Archive Style Book Weather Forecast MOST VIEWED IN NEWS
