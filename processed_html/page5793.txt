Disallowed goal, shud b a 2nd yellow...all calls going against Juve. Where are the Juve haters?  Hypocrites! I am not a Maple Leaf fan, not at all, but that Austin Matthews kid is really really good.  # austinmatthews # whatagoal The  # DallasCowboys  should explain to Terence Williams the use of the white lines on either side of field.  # tucktheball  OR  # runoutofbounds can ' t believe the nonsense coming out of Bergevin ' s mouth. This mgt group rivals the comedy that was the Houle era.  # Habs  suck...  # PKSubban Marquis Grissom...
