hymen covering vaginal hole yahoo answers i really don x27 t see a vaginal hole my hymen is covering it is it because i x27 m a virgin and it needs to break in order to see it completely all i see down there when i check is a hymen that x27 s very noticable no hole -.- i do get periods tho so obviously i have one but i can x27 t see it first google around there x27 s line drawings of potential hymen variations that will inform you without scarring your mind keep your terms medical and you x27 ll get useful information it would be rare to have a micropore hymen but it x27 s does happen if you x27 ve had a period you know there x27 s an opening it x27 s possible that it x27 s super small or not where it normally would be but it x27 s more likely you x27 re just not looking hard enough get a large mirror and a flashlight look toward the top of the entrance of your vagina generally the hymen is cresent moon shaped and the opening is more towards the upper front of the vagina closer to your face than butt see what i x27 m saying look there press downwards towards the butt if by spreading the inner labia and pressing the hymen downwards you truly see no opening or you see a super small opening that doesn x27 t allow a pinkie finger or you see any hymenal variation that x27 s not gon na work in the long run you just need to see a gyno and get their opinion it x27 s very thin tissue it x27 s not a big deal to fix if you are the rare chick with a micropore or septate hymen
