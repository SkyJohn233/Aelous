The racket made of ultra rigid carbon fibers with higher strength and rigidity, sustainable for more string tension, and reducible to the risk of frame deformation. The rigid carbon fiber is used to decrease the weight and improve its strength for easy control. The carbon fiber helps decrease frame weight and ensures higher strength and rigidity. The top slim shaft design provides extreme strength and easier free control. The 7.0 mm top slim shaft design provides extreme strength and easier free control. Perfect balance with racket weight and moving inertia and aerodynamics. High tensile slim shaft as the mainstay of power and skill, strictly and precisely release the intention of players, in a cohesive state of racket and the body. All-round optimized design improves racket mechanical structure for more efficient attack and defense system. The sweet point extends upward and the hitting point is moved higher. The effective defense area is enlarged for severe smash by dynamic-optimum frame. The hitting velocity is improved considerably with widened stringing area and increased bounce strength. Based on aerotec beam system, support of advanced calculation and gathered practicing data, the structure and shape of rackets frame section have extreme low drag coefficient and high intensity, to enable the playersÂ´ performance in various shots. The Aerotec-Beam System is an extra aero dynamic badminton racket frame structure that is specially engineered to minimize air resistance while maintaining the strength of the frame. The stabilized torsion angle ensures high elasticity of the racket. It helps to create high quality strike back, even though the hitting point departed from the sweet point. Extensive research and design has resulted in the UHB Shaft for improved badminton racket flex higher up on the shaft to provide extreme strength and control. The UHB shaft improves smash performance and is especially effective when hitting half smashes.
