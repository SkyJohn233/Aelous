penrose yukich weak laws of large numbers in geometric probability mathew d. penrose and j. e. yukich search this author in search this author in full-text access by subscription using a coupling argument we establish a general weak law of large numbers for functionals of binomial point processes in d -dimensional space with a limit that depends explicitly on the possibly nonuniform density of the point process the general result is applied to the minimal spanning tree the k -nearest neighbors graph the voronoi graph and the sphere of influence graph functionals of interest include total edge length with arbitrary weighting number of vertices of specified degree and number of components we also obtain weak laws of large numbers functionals of marked point processes including statistics of boolean models source a href= euclid.aoap ann appl probab volume 13 number 1 2003 277-303 dates first available in project euclid 16 january 2003 br permanent link to this document https /projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoap/1042765669 digital object identifier doi:10.1214 aoap/1042765669 mathematical reviews number mathscinet a href= https /mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem mr=1952000 mr1952000 p zentralblatt math identifier a href= https /zbmath.org/ q=an:1029.60008 1029.60008 subjects primary a title= search this subject in euclid href= search_result type=index linkedsearch=1 q.a.subject=60d05 60d05 geometric probability and stochastic geometry see also 52a22 53c65 secondary a title= search this subject in euclid href= search_result type=index linkedsearch=1 q.a.subject=60f25 60f25 l p l^p -limit theorems keywords a title= search this keyword in euclid href= search_result type=index q.a.keyword=weak+law+of+large+numbers linkedsearch=1 weak law of large numbers computational geometry objective method minimal spanning tree nearest neighbors graph voronoi graph sphere of influence graph proximity graph boolean models penrose mathew d. yukich j. e. weak laws of large numbers in geometric probability ann appl probab 13 2003 no 1 277 303. doi:10.1214/aoap/1042765669 https //projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoap/1042765669 what is mathjax see more xa9 2019 project euclid
