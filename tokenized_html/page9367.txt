as a lamp full stack developer i started my career by working on only html and css for web designing after some time i came to know that it s much better for a web page to be interactive so i learned javascript ajax and jquery then i heard about dynamic web development then i learned php mysql apache after that i have no of clients and then i need to shift from shared hosting to vps so then i learned about vps linux shell apache after learning about linux and shell then i interacted with some foreign clients who needed their website to be fast then after i learned about redis oracle perl and the process of learning still going on…… as currently there are some technologies in my ocean php perl python django yii oracle mysql postgres redis html css jquery javascript ajax linux apache vps shared hosting cpanel etc so for being a full stack developer it s your passion and enthusiasm for being a full stack happy leaning….. 540,185 views 136,684 views 117,981 views 26,446 views 3,523

back-end portions of an application front end the front end of a website is the part a user sees and directly interacts with it s built with html css and javascript back end while the front end is everything the user interacts with directly the back end is much more behind-the-scenes and can have some advantages over front end technologies for specific projects back end programming languages include php ruby python java and more database when building web applications we would always store data somewhere and access it later that is where a database comes in handy mongo db is nosql database you would primarily be using while working with full-stack javascript git postman git is a version control system that allows you are a developer working individually or on a team to keep track of all the changes being made to a codebase it s important to know a few important things related to git so that you understand how to properly get the latest code that you ve missed update parts of the code make fixes and change other people s code without breaking things developers use postman to build modern software for the api-first world online tutorials conclusion the best only way to become a full stack web developer is by doing the practical experiments first learn the concept then implement that one.you do not want to be the master in all technologies but you need the

language in web development which contains tons of features once you feel that you have got a command in all these you can move towards the more complex part i.e. backend development which deals with the database user authentication and application logic if you ask someone about which language to use for backend there will be tons of responses and you ll end up with nothing but confusion according to me whichever language you choose just stick with it and learn as much as you can learn about it whether it be python ruby node.js java or php while learning to build web applications at some point you ll need to store data somewhere and access it later for this you need to have a good grasp of the topics http is a stateless application protocol on the internet — it allows clients to communicate with servers this is one of the important tools for web development i hope this was helpful you need to know enough to reasonably set up a web application from infrastructure through front-end that doesn t mean you re an expert in them — pro-tip you re not going to be you re choosing to go broad not deep you need to know enough to be able to find the details you don t know off-hand using search

answer is no as you have just touched the surface start picking up either front end or backend post learning both and look into advanced topics like code optimisation compression performance etc how to become a full stack developer as one of the hottest topics for developers the discussions have never stopped on linkedin and facebook lots of people put their job title as a full stack developer besides it seems that the full stack topic has already become a new job trend an article on medium has discussed the full stack designer getting both praise and blame some people think that the full

just a title what he/she should focus on is the real personal ability and technology essentially i think the discussion about the full stack is also a kind of argument relating to the all-rounder and expert in the it industry and debate on the depth and breadth of development skills you can t have your cake and eat it too while the full stack developers and full stack designers seem like they are challenging this possibility because their horizontal skills tree gives them the ability to both have and eat the cake there is another saying is that jack of all trades but master of none so it s necessary to think about how to become a real full stack developer but not an empty title 1 what is a full stack developer simply put full stack developer is a kind of people who master a variety of skills and use these skills to complete a product independently a top voted answer on quora explained that what is a full stack developer a full stack developer is an engineer who can handle all the work of databases servers systems engineering and clients depending on the project what customers need may be a mobile stack a web stack or a native application stack in fact full stack refers to the collection of a series of technologies needed to complete a project stack refers to a collection of sub-modules these software sub-modules or components combined together to achieve the established function while without the need for other modules 2 why has the full stack developer been controversially discussed as it mentioned above the discussion about full stack developer is actually the debate on the depth and breadth of skills especially at the oscon conference a facebook engineer said they only hired a full stack developer. this topic came as a result of a heated discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of being a full stack developer advantages the full stack developers involved in a horizontal technical requirement so that he/she can make a prototype design for a product very rapidly with his wide range of techniques with the full stackability they have a broader angle of views and a more active mindset moreover they will be more sensitive to techniques and products so this kind of people can always have his/her opinions towards the product or design from another aspect he/she can provide help to everyone in the team and greatly reduce the time and technical costs of team communication technology docking so many of them become entrepreneurs or as technical partners in start-up companies disadvantages it is precisely because of the horizontal technology development some the full stack developers can not be expert in one skill most of them who claim to be full stacks developer are only know a little about the multiple skills as for how to make the architecture more suitable for the modular development that s a question 3 even so there are still people asking how to become a full stack developer a qualified full stack developer should have functional knowledge and capabilities for all aspects involved in building the application 1 programming languages you need to be proficient in multiple programming languages such as java php c python ruby perl etc as most of your core business processes need to be written in these languages.maybe not all need but you also have to master the language grammar and to be very familiar with how to structure design implementation and testing of the project based on one language or more languages for example if you choose java then you need to master the object-oriented design and development design patterns j2ee-based components of the development and so on 2 use development frameworks and third-party libraries the popular development languages are generally accompanied by a good development framework such as java spring mybatis hibernate python django php thinkphp yin nodejs express and so on 3 front-end technology front-end technologies are becoming more and more important in today s project and product development in addition to product features the user experience is also one of the criteria to test the success of a product all that depends on the implementation of the front-end technology soyou need to master some basic front-end technologies such as html5 css3 javascript and further study the front-end frameworks or third-party libraries such as jquery less sass angularjs or react 4 database and cache any product or project needs a database to store data as a full stack developer you also need to have at least one or two databases and know how to interact with the database currently the popular database is mysql mongodb redis oracle sqlserver and so on as a document-type database mongodb is being used more widely in internet products as for larger projects ialso recommend using mysql or commercial oracle as the back-end database while memory databases such as redis can be used for caching to improve system performance 5 basic design ability most of the articles or discussions about the full stack developer are rarely related to the design requirements but i think the design skill is very important the principle and skill of basic prototype design ui design ux design are also needed to understand 6 self-requirements are also an essential factor to become a full stack developer wrap up according to gladwell s 10,000 hours of law it will spend 10 years to master the front-end back-end client-oriented knowledge content to be a full stack developer therefore the full stack developer is by no means to accomplished overnight what you need to do is laying the technical foundation strengthen the core skills and keep learning for more challenges to become a full stack developer you need to learn below listed front end technologies like to become a full stack developer you need to learn below listed back end technologies like to become a full stack developer you need to learn below listed database server technologies like to become a full stack developer you need to learn below listed project management tools like to become a full stack developer you need to learn below listed front end technologies like to become a full stack developer you need to learn below listed back end technologies like to become a full stack developer you need to learn below listed database server technologies like to become a full stack developer you need to learn below listed project management tools like this full-stack burger is very best explanation of technologies and services for full-stack developement good luck these are the major skills you need to become a full-stack developer— these are the major skills you need to become a full-stack developer— as you might imagine learning all the above skills can take a long time usually it takes 2–3 years for an average developer to become a full-stack developer in fact the skills /technologies i have mentioned above are just a handful of technologies there are a lot more to learn however as a fresher in full-stack development you are not required to know all of these you can simply begin by learning a server-side language and a related framework primarily back-end technologies and learn other technologies and skills as you progress in your career now as you might have noticed that i have mentioned several server-side languages in back-end so which one should you go for begin by learning javascript why you will have two major advantages— the above graph is from stack overflow developer s report 2018 as you can see javascript is the most popular language the reason for popularity of javascript is the growing use of node.js the primary reason for companies using node.js is that it offers unmatched scalability meaning websites and web apps built with node.js can handle large traffic easily hence companies and start-ups are using node.js to avoid any future scalability issues in fact companies which were earlier using technologies like php are now moving to node.js 2 you will become a full-stack developer sooner — earlier in order to become full-stack developer one had to know a server-side language for back-end and javascript for front-end not anymore since javascript can now be used for back-end one doesn t have to learn an additional programming language and can work with javascript for both front-end and back-end with node.js overall if you go with javascript you will become a full-stack developer sooner compared to other technologies and find job opportunities pretty sooner as it has more demand compared to any other technology now as you are looking to become a full-stack developer i want to tell you that full-stack development or web development for that matter is a highly application oriented so learning the above technologies/skills is not enough you need to work on real development projects it is best if you learn by working on projects in fact while hiring full-stack developers projects are the first thing companies look at so focus on doing projects the more projects you do the better overall if you want to become a full-stack developer i would suggest you tp follow this appraoch — since you are looking to become a so i would recommend you to use edwisor here you can learn complete full-stack development using node.js and other javascript-based frameworks while working on challenging development projects you can easily use the projects you do here as your portfolio plus you will find good job opportunities in full-stack development as a lot of companies hire full-stack developers from here based on the projects people do here so give it a try i hope this helps i don t want to just repeat what rudi cilibrasi mentioned he already gave you a good list what i will say is that time management is going to play a major role in your learning of each language dedicate some serious time to studying and applying what you learn daily if at all possible you should spend a minimum of 2 hours a day practicing even more if you can they say it takes 10,000 hours to master something so time blocking is very important turn off the tv close your door and jump in front of the computer you should spend a significant amount of time understand each language her i don t want to just repeat what rudi cilibrasi mentioned he already gave you a good list what i will say is that time management

stack two common ones are mern mongodb-or-mysql expressjs reactjs nodejs mean mondodb-or-mysql expressjs angularjs nodejs and so on i d recommend looking at sites/apps you d like to emulate and figuring out what their particular stack is and go from there in a nutshell the stack will have a database a backend a frontend and a means of interacting between the three being a full stack developer u should have knowledge of all the stack in the web development which includes ui like html css etc. one java script framework like angular react one server side technology like node js java c etc and one database like mongo sql one can learn them either by online courses or any instructer led online or class room based course one such institute for instucrtor led course which really impress me is newstein leading full stack web development training center major factors which separate this institute from other institutes are being a full stack developer u should have knowledge of

field to enter and navigate and only the best of the best makes it to the top before delving into what a full-stack developer needs to know here s the lowdown on who they are and why they re important who is a full stack developer a full-stack developer works on the front end and back end of applications and websites on the front end they take care of the design and functionality while on the back end they code and prepare the proverbial engine that powers the app or website there s also a. third layer to this equation that is considered highly useful– the data base layer which involves maintaining repositories of data that is displayed and used on the website or app a full-stack developer is more of a jack of all trades that an expert at each level– the benefit of a good full stack developer is that they can understand client-facing and server-oriented sides of a platform know where to make tweaks and understand the overall functionality why do you need a full stack developer a full-stack developer keeps the entire system running efficiently this is because they know the function of each end and can therefore make changes where required if there are hiccups in the process companies generally prefer full-stack developers over singular front end or back end developers because that developer is all of these rolled into one this means the expenses are less but the quality of work and timelines are adhered to in the long run this reduces the costs and repercussions of internal communication between developers because chances are the full-stack developer knows the ins and outs of the product and can very well introduce changes themselves what should a full stack developer know now that the skeleton of the profile is in place here s the lowdown on the hard skills a full-stack developer needs to know to be able to market themselves as just that front-end technologies a good full-stack developer is well-versed in the basics of technology such as html javascript and css3 which form the core of front-end development third-party libraries also aid in the development of ux/ui so knowledge of libraries such as less angular and react js is highly favoured basics of design to be able to build a functional user-friendly interface every full-stack developer needs intermediate or higher knowledge of web and product design principles of prototype designs and ui/ux design go a long way especially in companies that are very much product-oriented or saas-based development languages to successfully build the back-end engine of the application or website a full-stack developer needs to know at least one of the main server-side programming language including ruby java and python without knowledge of these it is highly impossible to get into the thick of back-end development database building every website or app has a database it heavily relies on to store and retrieve data as a full-stack developer you need to understand the use and benefits of at least two databases as well as understand how to use and implement it databases vary depending on the use so picking up skills in the one you plan to use the most or the one the job of your dreams demands is a good way to approach this some of the more popular databases are oracle redis and mongodb no job is complete with just a repository of hard skills– soft skills are equally important even in full-stack development problem solving this is a crucial aspect of full-stack development as a website or an app could run an error any time– the true test of your hard skills is being able to think clearly and put knowledge to practical use before too much damage is caused business dynamics a full-stack developer must understand the product within its financial and business use too it s not enough to build it and call it a day– full-stack development also ties in with how the product will be marketed by the firm and used by the client web architecture is no easy feat which is why full-stack developers and full stack developer courses are so in demand today it s a lucrative field to say the least and with enough knowledge and soft skills the transition is challenging and growth-oriented for reference what should a full-stack developer know imarticus both front end and back end here is a brief introduction to what a full stack developer should know front end back end dev ops database management seo and so on keep in mind you don t have to master everything on the list may i recommend freecodecamp as a starting point because they guide you properly through the process the journey is tedious but totally worth it at the end good luck a full-stack developer doesn t automatically controller of all technologies although the executive is anticipated to work on the client as well as server and understand what is going on when blossoming an execution he or she should have actual curiosity in all software technologies competence goals are recommended to enhance a full stack developer full stack developer should see at least server-side programming languages like java python ruby .net etc proficiency of various dbms technology is another vital

have to learn mysql postgresql or mongodb depending on the app s design once you have mastered all of that there s the infrastructure you ll have to comprehend you don t have to be an expert in every command or operation but you ll need to understand the fundamentals and be able to deploy an app to a production environment i.e ubuntu with nginx/apache and phusion passenger or puma or unicorn if
