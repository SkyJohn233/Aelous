Leash - Dota 2 Wiki Leash  is a status effect that prevents affected units from casting some mobility spells, sharing the same list as  root . Leash does not disable a unit in any way. It merely disables casting several mobility spells, sharing interactions with the  root  mechanic. Several  blink ,  pseudo-blink  and  teleport  spells are disabled while leashed, to prevent an easy escape. However, although it prevents casting those spells, it does not cancel them when getting leashed while the spell is already cast. Furthermore, leashes do not interrupt channeling spells, but always cancel the teleports of  Town Portal Scroll  and  Boots of Travel . A list of disabled spells can be found below.
