flow cytometry analysis of the expression of neutrophil fmlp receptors sciencedirect sciencedirect the number of cell surface fmlp receptors expressed by peripheral blood neutrophils taken from healthy individuals was quantitated using a direct fluorescence label analysed on the facscan receptor numbers assayed on cells from heparinised blood prepared at 4°c or 37°c or in the presence of lps 30 ng/ml were 12,540 ± sd 2413 18,588 ± 4938 and 45,041 ± 10,744 respectively anticoagulation with egta resulted in 25–30 greater basal receptor numbers but had no effect on receptor level after maximal stimulation with lps double labelling with a neutrophil-specific mab showed that the entire neutrophil population expressed fmlp receptors elsevier we use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads by continuing you agree to the use of cookies copyright © 2019 elsevier b.v. or its licensors or contributors sciencedirect ® is a registered trademark of elsevier b.v. sciencedirect ® is a registered trademark of elsevier b.v
