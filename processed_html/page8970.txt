Ridley Scott’s parasitic space alien has returned for this watchable if unoriginal sci-fi thriller — though it doesn’t grow all that much these days. Michael Fassbender is back, too, as the creepy deadpan robot who glides around in the style of a Jeeves/Lecter hybrid, wearing a tight-fitting outfit apparently made out of nylon, and in which he appears as flat-fronted in the trouser department as Barbie’s boyfriend Ken. And Scott himself has again returned to the helm of the Alien franchise he effectively created with  the first film  in 1979, before ceding directorial control to James Cameron, David Fincher and Jean-Pierre Jeunet for the sequels, and others for the novelty bouts with  Predator . This movie is a sequel to the prequel  Prometheus , which Scott directed in 2012, a movie that was there supposedly to set up the events in the first film, all about a space quest for mankind’s  Däniken -esque origin on other planets. Prometheus was set in 2094; this is happening 10 years later, in 2104, with a colonist ship, called the Covenant, travelling for years through space, intended to set up a plantation on a distant world which appears to have the means to support human life. But the terrified crew encounter an awful truth about the Prometheus, as well as a sharp-toothed, uninvited little guest. This is a modal window. Of course, it is futile to concern yourself with the timeline of the Alien films when effectively they are happening in parallel, not in sequence. They are variations on the same theme. The one change is that Prometheus and  Alien: Covenant  take the legendary android reveal at the end of the first Alien, and matter-of-factly incorporate it into the prequels as part of the establishing premise. This film inflates Fassbender’s robot role hugely. He first appears in an eerie, interesting opening sequence which the rest of the film cannot really match: a huge white room, with a grand piano, a panorama-window showing some generic alpine landscape, a full-scale model of Michelangelo’s David, and other high-art objects. There we find Fassbender’s robot being questioned by his testy scientist-creator Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) and invited to choose a name for himself, the robot hubristically says David, after the statue.  Inspired by his own achievement in fashioning this humanoid robot, Weyland himself insists that there must be a creationist meaning and purpose to the universe, a religious theme that is, vaguely, to recur. In  Prometheus , Noomi Rapace’s space voyager Dr Elizabeth Shaw wore a cross around her neck; in Alien: Covenant a crew member wears the star of David. It could be a reference to the robot’s name. But when we recognise this robot again, on board the Covenant, there are some immediately obvious changes, whose point is revealed later. A freak electrical storm awakens the crew prematurely from their artificial hibernation (rather as in the movie  Passengers , with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, which riffed on the idea slightly more interestingly) and a calamity means that the unlikable rationalist Oram (Billy Crudup) is promoted to captain, with Daniels (Katherine Waterston) and Tennessee (Danny McBride) his immediate subordinates. The catastrophe means his crew are reluctant to resume their deep sleep and instead become fixated on an alternative possibility: another planet, hardly a few weeks’ voyage from their current position, on which there appears to be evidence of human life and which presents itself as a ready-made new home. Should they chance everything by going down and taking a look? Should they, much more to the point, walk around down there without their protective helmets and spacesuits on, so that evil spores from little pod-like growths can get into their ear canals and up their noses? Have these people learned nothing at all? Just as in Prometheus, the action is opened out from the claustrophobic confines of the spaceship to the vast prospects of a distant planet, which turns out to be a mix of Pompeii and Easter Island. There is a wonderful long shot of the explorers in the darkness of this planet, the tiny green beams of their torches darting around them. The  vu  has never been so  déja : it’s a greatest-hits compilation of the other  Alien  films’ freaky moments. The paradox is that though you are intended to recognise these touches, you won’t really be impressed unless you happen to be seeing them for the first time. For all this, the film is very capably made, with forceful, potent performances from Waterston and Fassbender. That franchise title is, however, looking increasingly wrong. It is a bit familiar. • This article was amended on 7 May 2017 to correct a reference from the “cross of David” to the “star of David”. … in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation. These are perilous times. Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened – democracy, civility, truth. This US administration is establishing new norms of behaviour. Anger and cruelty disfigure public discourse and lying is commonplace. Truth is being chased away. But with your help we can continue to put it center stage. It will be defining year and we’re asking for your help as we prepare for 2020.  Rampant disinformation, partisan news sources and social media ' s tsunami of fake news is no basis on which to inform the American public in 2020. The need for a robust, independent press has never been greater, and with your help we can continue to provide fact-based reporting that offers public scrutiny and oversight. We are also committed to keeping our journalism open and accessible to everyone and with your help we can keep it that way. " America is at a tipping point, finely balanced between truth and lies, hope and hate, civility and nastiness. Many vital aspects of American public life are in play – the Supreme Court, abortion rights, climate policy, wealth inequality, Big Tech and much more. The stakes could hardly be higher. As that choice nears, the Guardian, as it has done for 200 years, and with your continued support, will continue to argue for the values we hold dear – facts, science, diversity, equality and fairness. "  – US editor, John Mulholland On the occasion of its 100th birthday in 1921 the editor of the Guardian said,  " Perhaps the chief virtue of a newspaper is its independence. It should have a soul of its own. "  That is more true than ever. Freed from the influence of an owner or shareholders the Guardian ' s robust independence is our unique driving force and guiding principle. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do.

The second in many ways better. The third was OK, and since then it ' s all been a bit been there done that. The vu, as the reviewer says, is a little too deja now. Please share your experiences as a deep space haulier so they can remake it more realistically. Good job I don ' t mind spoilers Peter! This no doubt looks all too familiar because the fans clamoured for a return to the classic template, the clue is the title A L I E N- covenant! Can I remind readers that you gave the first Fantastic Four film 4 Stars, which is a travesty in anyone ' s book! Perhaps film makers should try and make an original film making showing new things rather than rehash what they have done before to appease fans. It is diminishing returns they way it is going. I hate spoilers. Thanks for the heads up. If you hate spoilers then  " Peter Bradshaw "  is a heads-up :-) The cross of David? There is such a thing, effectively a star of David with a crucifix in the middle. Having not seen the film I can ' t tell you if this is what Peter is referring to. I ' m staggered that a franchise on its 6th (8th?) instalment doesn ' t feel as fresh as it once did. Yeah! If only it could be more like Police Academy in that regard, pure comedy gold from the first installment to the last. A great story is a great story. That said, the story has so many branches it could follow, it ' s just tha Prometheus seem to choose the wrong one.  I loved the enigmatic Space Jockey from Alien, and Prometheus making him into a Demi-God rather than a boring alien pirate or courier ruins it for me.  Also, taking if off-shoots, it ' s a shame Scott has seemingly killed of Neill Blomkamps reimagined Alien 3. " Demi-god " ? I think you ' re confusing the  " Engineers "  do-fors with the Engineers themselves. They were less even than technicians, certainly not engineers, which would explain the child-like nature of the space controls which David operated in Prometheus The fans moaned when Scott tried something inventive with Prometheus. A lot of films are suffering the overly familiar fate. Scott didn ' t do anything inventive with Prometheus. Prometheus is riddled with B-horror movie clichés, and in fact the main story beats are lifted wholesale from Alien Vs Predator, right down to Weyland’s quest for immortality. We didn’t moan because it wasn’t  " familiar "  enough. We moaned because of the shitty screenplay. I think they moaned that it was bad. It kind of was. I watched Prometheus and thought it unworthy of the hype and build up and even during the film (without further reflection in the hours and days after) it was a poorly scripted mess. The reflection then reinforced how bad it was on a very basic level and hiding behind the effects and slickness, which is typical these days. Later when I thought i should give it another chance and watch it again I was more disappointed since its flaws become more obvious rather than receding behind any stronger qualities. I keep thinking I should watch it now for a rfresh before seeing covenant but i don ' t think i can bear it. A good film will improve with repeated viewings.... Why not simply avoid the new movie and see the original at the hell-fire caves in west Wycombe on Wednesday night courtesy of the chilterns vintage cinema. Check it out at  www.vintagecinema.co.uk I dunno. Maybe because  1. My telly is five meters away and I can watch the original on that 2. The cinema is 15 minutes away and I can watch the new one there 3. Wycombe is far away and I couldn ' t be bothered Having once lived nearby and visited the caves, it ' s an interesting place. You are aware of what used to happen in there ? A movie of its history could be called ALIEN : Hellfire ..... Or how I shagged and drank my way to the top Thanks so much! Did not know about this :) It ' s truly difficult to know where to begin with this review. Being no fan of the latest Alien franchise installments I was nonetheless forced to sign up for an account and comment on several points. But I must ask, why in the Universe is is necessary to comment on the displayed size of a characters penis in the third sentence of the review? Some people prefer their androids well hung, i suppose? Do you mean  " flat-fronted in the trouser department " ? I read this to mean that the robot (which is not a person) had no sexual organs, as is quite common with robots. This means  no  penis,  not  a Donald sized one. Nobody forced you to sign up, but now you ' re here, welcome to CiF BTL! Perhaps he was making the point that future robots won ' t be as  " realistic "  as some would like? Yeah, well, that ' s what I figured it ' d be from the trailer. After Aliens, which didn ' t really follow on from Alien in its theme, the franchise got completely lost. Prometheus was more unintentionally funny than scary. Alien had a sense of claustrophobia that can ' t be repeated in a planet setting.  Covenant looks like a remake of the first, but with baggage. It ' s a good job Scott is not involved too much in the new Bladerunner film. This franchise really is just like the Terminator one at this stage. With better cinematography. Do you mean, as with the Terminator, it really should have stopped after the second film? Or even after the first. Pretty much.
