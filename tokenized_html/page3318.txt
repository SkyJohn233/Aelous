serena williams proves semi-tough at wimbledon the undefeated she rallies after dropping first set to position herself to win first major as a mother if there was any panic among fans of serena williams as she dropped the first set of her wimbledon quarterfinal match against camila giorgi that angst definitely didn t carry onto the court and into the mind of the world s greatest tennis player i said all right said williams who hadn t dropped a set the entire tournament before tuesday let s go three sets. seventeen months ago williams won her last major the 2017 australian open while pregnant on tuesday williams was one step closer to winning her first major as a mother as she came back from a set down to beat giorgi 3-6 6-3 6-4 to advance to the wimbledon semifinals this journey that williams is taking tennis fans on since her return earlier this year has been pretty spectacular considering yet here williams is getting stronger and moving better with every match in giorgi williams was facing an opponent who was young 26 strong and playing perhaps the best tennis of her career in a tournament where the top 10 women s players have been eliminated giorgi hadn t faced a seeded player since her first-round win over no 21 anastasija sevastova giorgi when asked going into the match against williams whether she would watch her opponent on tape responded i don t follow tennis women s tennis. she probably should have done her homework on williams who crushed the upset-minded italian after dropping the first set williams has more wins in a major after losing a first set 39 than any other player in the women s open era chris evert has 28 and venus williams has 27 giorgi appeared a bit salty — maybe that s her normal demeanor — as she shook hands with williams at the net after the match and quickly grabbed her bag and walked off the court it was great matches giorgi said in her postmatch news conference i think it s a great week. williams asked whether she s felt any pressure during this tournament said this is only my fourth tournament back i don t feel pressure i don t feel like i have to win this i m just here just to be here and to prove that i m back williams added i feel like i m back but i still have a long way to go to get to where i was. that was winning majors and williams enters the semifinals as the lowest-seeded player 25th remaining in this year s wimbledon tournament her opponent on friday julia goerges is seeded 13th williams hasn t lost a set against goerges in three previous matches including a victory last month at the french open 6-3 6-4 in the round of 32 against the other two players in the semifinals williams has never played no 12 seed jelena ostapenko and has won six of her eight matches against angelique kerber the no 11 seed here s the reason williams has emerged as a favorite she has seven wimbledon titles while the rest of the field has zero the queen is back with tuesday s win guaranteeing that she will jump

team s 5-7 start to the season illustrations by nathan gelgud martenzie is an associate editor for the undefeated his favorite cinematic moment is when django said y all want to see somethin by naming its gym after the hall of famer hampton s bethel high school honored a prep career that came to an abrupt end 25 years ago h ampton va. — allen iverson wasn t scheduled to speak tuesday when bethel high school renamed its gymnasium and basketball court in his honor but realistically the man known locally as bubba chuck had to know he wasn t getting out of his former school s airspace without touching his people and as the 2001 nba mvp and hall of famer began to speak on came those familiar tears and lip quiver and that familiar choppy voice i m virginia he said a few seconds later iverson tried again i m virginia. fighting back tears he continued it s as simple as that … i ve loved y all for all these years for supporting me throughout the ups and downs in my life we us we virginia we beautiful we the best and we the toughest strongest and we believe in each other i just love y all. to say the feeling was mutual wouldn t do the moment justice the tidewater region of virginia — known as seven cities or the 757 — worships the ground iverson 44 walks on especially its black community screams of we love you chuck and take your time bruh made this ribbon-cutting ceremony feel like sunday service this is my home this is who i am the 11-time all star told news 3 in hampton it s just a beautiful feeling seeing people that are here that actually care. more than 200 men women and children stood shoulder to shoulder near the outside entrance to the gym all hoping to get close to the four-time nba scoring champion the speakers included hampton mayor donnie tuck school board chairwoman ann stevens cherry and iverson s longtime confidante and manager gary moore taking in the moment from the back were new jersey high school basketball legend former university of memphis star and cleveland cavaliers 2002 first-round pick dajuan wagner and consultant william worldwide wes wesley allen iverson needs no introduction in this community because he has always been invested in this community said cherry we thank bubba chuck for not forgetting where he came up we thank him for contributing to hampton city schools and to bethel high school s athletic program — male and female the naming of this gym is significant but more significant is the fact that he gave generously to a school that he didn t forget and today this school is not forgetting him. bethel high known as 1067 for its street number on big bethel road in some ways still looks like it did when iverson was enrolled there for three years in the early 1990s about two-thirds of its nearly 1,800 students are black its basketball and football teams which iverson made national commodities with two state titles in the same academic year have found occasional success — though in recent years both programs have struggled inside the entrance to the gym before arriving at the court the first sign reads allen iverson gymnasium to the left stands a glass case of memorabilia from signed basketballs jerseys and vintage photos of iverson at various stages of his playing career iverson returned to bethel when the school retired his jersey in 2003 and he s been donating to its athletic program ever since now the gym he made famous will bear his name totally well-deserved grammy-nominated rapper and virginia beach native pusha t told the undefeated via phone seeing this happen right now — we needed to check off that box. of course iverson technically never finished bethel high school he couldn t life saw fit otherwise but if tuesday proved anything it s that not all graduations come with a diploma nba hall of famer allen iverson encourages the crowd to get loud before the game between the toronto raptors and philadelphia 76ers at the wells fargo center on feb. 5 in philadelphia mitchell leff/getty images in the 90s high school sports in the 757 featured future household names such as aaron brooks ronald curry and michael vick yet iverson accomplished just as much if not more while playing with a shorter high school shelf life he started at wide receiver as a freshman and by his sophomore year played both quarterback and roamed the secondary on defense he was unanimously named to the all-peninsula district team as a sophomore after recording 13 interceptions — including five in one game in his junior year iverson became a national name for his exploits both in football and basketball i was in los angeles and they re talking about allen iverson i was in florida and they re talking about allen iverson aau basketball guru boo williams told the newport news daily press in 1993 he s a living legend i hang around the gyms and hear kids talking about him said bob bailey who served as public address announcer at bethel s basketball games during iverson s time i think everybody who lives in aberdeen and north hampton who s 6 or 7 years old knows bubba chuck. in the summer of 1992 iverson led williams aau squad to the national championship in winston-salem north carolina as he was at four other venues that summer iverson was named mvp of the tournament once the school year started his domination continued as a quarterback defensive back and kick returner iverson amassed 2,204 total yards and 29 total touchdowns including four punts a kickoff and two interceptions returned for touchdowns iverson would lead bethel to its first state championship since 1976 that season in the title game against e.c glass he threw for 201 yards ran for a touchdown took a punt 60 yards to the house and intercepted two passes on defense at the time florida state saw iverson as the heir apparent to charlie ward who played both quarterback and point guard for the seminoles iverson didn t rest long three days after bethel s football title he got to work on the basketball court dropping 37 in a season-opening win against kecoughtan he d score at least 40 points seven times that season his games packed his local gym and the hampton coliseum college scouts saw him as the best high school basketball player in the country iverson s 982 points that season stood as virginia s single-season scoring record until mac mcclung broke the mark in 2018 his high school games felt like college even at that age and during those times he was somebody said pusha t. he was a hero to all of us i don t really remember him being a peer he changed the game and he was from us save for maybe teddy riley there was no bigger celebrity from the 757 at that time than allen iverson which made what happened on feb. 14 1993 one of the most pivotal and dividing moments in hampton s history iverson and a group of friends were bowling having fun and being rowdy at hampton s circle lanes now called sparetimes typical high school behavior as most around town tell it but a brawl between iverson s friends all of them black and a white group ignited into a national news story america was on edge over racial violence and the criminal justice system s role in preserving it this was two years after the rodney king police beating and latasha harlins murder a year after the los angeles riots and a year before the o.j simpson trial now the most recognizable high school athlete in the country was at the center of a controversy involving race and justice footage of the brawl showed chairs being thrown and chaos erupting in the bowling alley one side claimed racial epithets were used the other said the black teenagers were looking for trouble but all those charged were black including iverson for three counts maiming by mob and one count of assault by mob iverson s focus on the basketball court remained sharp even as his world shifted around him the night he was charged he dropped 42 in a game iverson s last home game at bethel would take place on march 2 1993 it was bethel s first regional appearance in nearly 19 years against the western branch of chesapeake iverson delivered a masterful performance with 32 points 13 rebounds nine assists eight steals and four blocked shots much like in football months earlier iverson would lead his team to the state championship and be honored as virginia s high school basketball player of the year he would never play another game at bethel high school in either sport as iverson s legal dilemma stretched past the end of his junior year not many expected the case to go beyond a slap on the wrist until it did iverson michael simmons melvin stephens jr. and samuel wynn were all convicted as adults of maiming by mob in september 1993 iverson was sentenced to five years in prison months later iverson simmons stephens and wynn were granted clemency by virginia gov l. douglas wilder — the first elected black governor in american history — on the condition they continue their education it would be wilder s final act in office iverson would receive his high school diploma from richard milburn high school in virginia beach his conviction was officially overturned less than a year later in june 1995 under then-georgetown head coach john thompson iverson would resume his basketball career in the nation s capital like virginia washington instantly came to embrace iverson as did philadelphia which drafted him first overall in 1996 iverson s career would be a hallmark of meteoric highs public lows and an unceremonious nba exit but all of this he d admit went into who iverson was just another flawed human trying to get life right i just wan na thank y all for being there for me and always on my side always in my huddle always in the foxhole with me iverson said tuesday afternoon i love my kids for believing in their daddy and understanding that i m human and i make mistakes just like everybody else. allen iverson responds to being introduced at halftime during the nba all-star game as part of the 2019 nba all-star weekend at the spectrum center on feb. 17 in charlotte north carolina streeter lecka/getty images bethel high originally planned to name just its basketball court after him but the reaction was instantaneous is that all you wan na do put his name on the court you sure you don t wan na name the gym after him hampton was never a perfect city nor was iverson a perfect person but it is impossible to tell the story of one without each other and that reverberated far beyond the city limits being from the 757 and being an artist from the 757 you don t always win everybody over artistically i ve watched people love the clipse — i ve watched some people not like the clipse pharrell timbaland missy elliott all the same it s been unanimous for iverson pusha t said he wore the superman cape he was loved by all seven cities like he was from all seven cities. two hundred people congregated outdoors here because iverson is bethel and bethel is iverson he s always been loyal to us said hampton resident stephanie brown and we ll always be loyal to him. the story wasn t always pretty nor did it have the ending many believed it should have had but allen iverson and bethel high school are forever and now it s in writing justin tinsley is a culture and sports writer for the undefeated he firmly believes cash money records takin ova for da 99 and da 2000 is the single-most impactful statement of his generation i told you from the start he talk about things that matter. burbank calif. – damian lillard is a four-time nba all-star who is in the first year of a four-year 191 million contract but if lillard had to rap for a living could he make money as his alter ego dame d.o.l.l.a famed rapper lil wayne thinks so he d do awesome lil wayne told the undefeated i think he d do well dame is dame off the court as well in the music game what i mean by that is dame has a lot of friends off the court with other teams just because of who he is and how he is that s the same thing in music so if he was to switch over he d have a lot of help and we all make sure that he won t put himself out there the wrong way so if you ask the question without the basketball if he was just a rapper with that said then i think he ll still be up there given what i m hearing out here today yeah he d be up there. while lillard of the portland trail blazers has collaborated with the likes of g-eazy and jadakiss the biggest star who he has shared a song with is lil wayne who has been on all three of his albums sitting in a record studio as the sun rose on the morning of nov. 24 lil wayne talked to the undefeated about his respect for lillard as a rapper and basketball star how he has improved his rap skills what he typically thinks of rapping athletes shaquille o neal and more when did you and dame first meet man i met dame a minute ago dame was so young i was so young honestly i ve been following him since school — since i turned on the tv and found out who damian lillard was i think i met him just by being courtside at a lot of the games a simple meet handshake or something like that when did you realize that dame had talent as a rapper when i gave him my ear when i listened to it first time i listened to it anyone who say they rap i m gon na listen to it before i hear it there s a difference ladies and gentlemen hearing something and listening to something so there s no cliché for music everybody s got a category and the category is individually their own but those categories they have umbrellas that they fall under and when i saw the umbrella that he fell under i was like wow. this is not the average sports person that want to rap they usually have a different — they fall under a different umbrella when did you realize that he was serious about music and that he was real what made this rapping athlete special truth plain and simple when i heard what he was talking about when i heard what he rapped about wasn t about what i thought it would be when you listen to a person like dame or any nba celebrity nfl that say they rap first thing i thought about just like first thing everybody else thought about was what is this song gon na be about the game about basketball or is it gon na be about your everyday life which i imagine is beautiful and we all imagine that so what it s about to be about how he came up and it s about what s real around him once i heard it i was like well what else did i expect typically when an athlete says i rap what s your initial response it depends on the person so when dame say he raps i know where dame from that s why i said once i did listen to it i asked myself what else did i expect that s why i said depends on the person. but overall they are younger these days that was the difference with dame the kids that coming up and play sports and say they rap they re younger so i understand where they coming from with it they got a different umbrella different category over there dame he in that so that made me listen what do you think about dame s lyrics and his flow love it love it and also dame is with anything gon na keep working at it especially doing things like this now definitely gon na keep working at it and the only thing you can get is better he started and the way he s at now is nice he don t talk about nothing fake that s what s awesome when you cut on a song and you hear someone talking about something that s true — truthful is something you can relate to in some kind of way and something that s not fabricated why is he important enough for you to be on his tracks good question because of the lyrics it s not something that we d expect not fabricated — this and that that and this it s truthful he sends me a song and i got to think about the song that right there is just the difference i do features every day mack maine sends me features every day i got two features that he emails me every other day you got to do this song you got to do that song i look at the song title see what it is sometimes i don t even got to hear it what s the song title got you. get a song from dame i m like i dunno. i got to sit down and think about this first dame talking about all this real truthful stuff you got to think about it what do you think about his court game come on now dame is a killer i m from the michael jordan era as far as the fan and kid watching jordan jordan had the killer instinct jordan didn t see no one in front of him you can see that in his eyes he didn t see no one in front of him dame got that that s also russell westbrook to me dame got that i don t see you the biggest part about dame s game that i love is his commitment his commitment to his teammates and to that city and to that team it s not about not going there for this and doing this and not joining this person for this it s just for the simple fact that he s there plain and simple he gives his all every time he s touched the court as a jordan baby you ve seen a lot of big shots right i already know what you about to ask go ahead then about dame s game-winning 40-foot shot that knocked the oklahoma city thunder out of the playoffs last

hit em with the supa hot fire but i m not a rapper legend pic.twitter.com/7vlhtvtzrz — the undefeated theundefeated april 24 2019 did you pay attention to dame s rap battle with shaquille o neal i didn t even hear the songs i didn t pay attention to it i can not lie i d be lying if i said i did but i heard about it obviously i saw what was going on but i have no opinion on it other than they totally different … they two different rappers shaq is a platinum artist i try to tell people that all the time shaq is a platinum artist and i know how hard it is to go platinum how do you think he s grown over these three albums as far as an artist he s grown lyrically he s grown subjectwise i told you from the start he talk about things that matter now what i noticed in his last album something that he wasn t doing to me he was making it a thing to not be what the public wants what the general music is just what i was expecting marc j. spears is the senior nba writer for the undefeated he used to be able to dunk on you but he hasn t been able to in years and his knees still hurt league still struggles with diversity in both coaching numbers and front-office positions although black monday is more than four weeks away the nfl s head coaching ranks became whiter tuesday with the firing of carolina panthers head coach ron rivera two days after losing to lowly washington on carolina s home field panthers owner david tepper removed the two-time associated press nfl coach of the year — and one of only four head coaches of color in the league — with four games remaining in the regular season the panthers promoted former secondary coach perry fewell who is african american to interim head coach the timing of the move raised eyebrows but it was not altogether unexpected for weeks there has been growing speculation within the league that rivera would be ousted on dec. 30 the monday following the conclusion of the regular season when most coaching changes occur under rivera who had held the position since 2011 the panthers have struggled the last two seasons as veteran quarterback cam newton has often been ineffective or sidelined because of injuries moreover tepper who completed his purchase of the franchise in july 2018 has privately expressed his desire to make substantive changes throughout the organization league sources told the undefeated with rivera out mike tomlin of the pittsburgh steelers anthony lynn of the los angeles chargers and brian flores of the miami dolphins are the league s remaining head coaches of color the nfl has 32 teams the panthers search for their next on-field leader is already underway the fritz pollard alliance hopes that the panthers as well as all teams that make changes with their top coaching positions will strongly consider deserving candidates of color rod graves will insist on it graves was hired in april as the primary decision-maker for the group that advises the nfl on matters of diversity and inclusion and which assists the league in enforcing the rooney rule he said he is eager to help panthers ownership chart a course forward with diversity in mind we re disappointed to see ron released ron is a fantastic coach he had an incredible record there in carolina and he did some outstanding things with that football team graves said we do understand that it happens in the league but the fritz pollard alliance is very concerned about the dwindling numbers at some point we hope to have a conversation with the ownership in carolina and we expect that that will be soon. graves has much to share on this topic though none of it is encouraging about the state of diversity in coaching and senior management in football and business operations when the 2018 season began the league had eight coaches of color matching 2011 and 2017 as the most it has had in any season at the end of the 2018 season there were eight head-coaching vacancies seven of those positions went to white coaches the league which is commemorating its 100th season has never had an african american team president kevin warren formerly the league s highest-ranking african american in business operations while serving as chief operating officer of the minnesota vikings left the nfl to become big ten commissioner tony wyllie formerly the highest-ranking african american in public relations at the team level when he was a senior vice president with washington left for a position with special olympics at the end of the 2016 season the nfl had seven black general managers now chris grier of the miami dolphins is the only african american in that role the nfl s on-field workforce is nearly 70 percent black commissioner roger goodell has acknowledged that the league isn t satisfied with where things stand in coaching and senior management the league is very aware of what the issues are with respect to diversity graves said i would expect that as much as the league has talked about diversity that this ownership in carolina as well as all ownership is well aware of what the issues are. goodell largely views the awful optics as a pipeline issue arguing that by doing more to help increase the pool of candidates of color for jobs minority representation would improve from the front office to the field we re in an era in which owners overwhelmingly pick from the offensive side of the ball to fill head-coaching vacancies effectively making the league s offensive coordinators head coaches in waiting leftwich and eric bieniemy of the kansas city chiefs are the nfl s only black offensive coordinators and leftwich is the only one of the two who has play-calling duties the other issue is that the pipeline argument doesn t entirely hold water theoretically the more qualified candidates of color there are for openings the greater the likelihood more will be hired as head coaches last season however bieniemy wasn t a top candidate for openings despite the key role he played in helping to develop kansas city chiefs superstar quarterback patrick mahomes the 2018 associated press nfl mvp for the nfl to effect positive change owners must be truly interested in hiring those in the pipeline rivera could be back in it presumably he would be an attractive candidate having guided the panthers to the playoffs four times in nine seasons in 2015 carolina went 15-1 and reached the super bowl rivera was selected the associated press coach of the year after 2013 and 15 seasons the talent that ron has is not out there in abundance graves said he has been a major contributor to league discussions whether it s regarding player safety or regarding rules he goes so far beyond the city limits of carolina he s well-respected in the league a coach of his stature will be sought after and i fully expect that if ron wants to coach he ll find a job. jason reid is the senior nfl writer at the undefeated he enjoys watching sports especially any games involving his son and
