Reiki Healing is a powerful yet gentle natural healing method, which has been effective in helping virtually every known illness and disorder, and always creates a beneficial effect. It also works in conjunction with other medical or therapeutic techniques as it relieves side effects and promotes recovery. The wonderful benefits of Reiki include relaxation, stress reduction and help for any emotional or psychic disorder. Reiki is also balancing chakras (energy channels) and strengthens the immune system. Reiki heals by flowing the healing energy through the Reiki healer so that it will affect the energy field and will charge the positive energy into the recipient. It raises the vibratory level of the energy field in and around the physical body where the negative thoughts and feelings are attached. This causes the negative energy to break apart and fall away. In that way Reiki clears, straightens and heals the energy pathways, thus allowing the life force to flow in a healthy and natural way. Reiki, Sound healing and Marma massage together will work their magic to balance and purify your whole being (body, mind and spirit). It will clean the blockages from your energy channels, thus helping the prana (energy) to flow. The combinations of treatments are especially powerful in helping to release old emotions and blocked energies and preparing your whole body for self-healing. You will feel increased levels of energy long after the treatments.
