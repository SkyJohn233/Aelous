2014 Annual Report | Barron County Sheriffs Department It is an honor and privilege to present the 2014 Annual Report. 2014 was a very busy year for the Sheriff’s Department with several major incidents. Some of the incidents included the Jared Brendel incidents in the Dallas area which lead to us returning gun fire after he shot at our deputies, the bank robbery at Dairy State Bank in Haugen and assisting with the capture of the bank robber from the Sterling Bank robbery in Rice Lake during the Barron County Fair. And most importantly is that each of our deputies returned home safe every day.
