juice dried fruit muesli yoghurt pieces of cheese fruit bread rice cakes pikelets and wholegrain crackers all make nutritious snacks you could also try making your own healthy muffins or cakes using vegetables or fruit for example sultanas carrot banana pumpkin or zucchini sweet cakes are best kept for special occasions such as birthdays unusual and interesting fillings can get your child excited about her sandwich so why not be a little adventurous for example you could try flat or pita bread with chopped carrot celery capsicum snow peas or cucumber what about cherry tomatoes corn beetroot or sprouts with dips or add grated carrot zucchini sliced red cabbage raisins or sultanas sliced apple or fresh herbs to liven things up here are more tasty sandwich combinations foods to keep out of lunch boxes meats such as salami mortadella strasburg smoked turkey and pastrami are highly processed and salty they can also be fatty you might want to save these for every now and then rather than packing them every day check the allowable foods policy at your child s centre kinder or school many centres and schools ask that you don t pack certain foods for example eggs or anything with nuts
