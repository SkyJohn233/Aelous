Awareness of infection is a necessary precursor to antiretroviraltreatment and risk reduction among HIV-infected persons. We report data onprevalence and awareness of HIV infection among MSM in 2008 and 2011, using data from 20 cities participating in the 2008 and 2011 National HIV BehavioralSurveillance System (NHBS) among MSM. Venue-based, time-space sampling was usedto recruit men for interview and HIV testing. We analyzed data for men whoreported ≥ 1 male sex partner in the past 12 months. Participants who testedpositive were considered to be aware of their infection if they reported a prior positive HIV test. We used multivariable analysis to examine differences between results from 2011 vs. 2008. HIV prevalence was 19% in 2008 and 18% in 2011 (p =0.14). In both years, HIV prevalence was highest among older age groups, blacks, and men with lower education and income. In multivariable analysis, HIVprevalence did not change significantly from 2008 to 2011 overall (p = 0.51) orin any age or racial/ethnic category (p > 0.15 in each category). Among thosetesting positive, a greater proportion was aware of their infection in 2011 (66%)than in 2008 (56%) (p < 0.001). In both years, HIV awareness was higher for olderage groups, whites, and men with higher education and income. In multivariableanalysis, HIV awareness increased from 2008 to 2011 overall (p < 0.001) and for allage and racial/ethnic categories (p < 0.01 in each category). In both years, black MSM had the highest HIV prevalence and the lowest awareness among racial/ethnicgroups. These findings suggest that HIV-positive MSM are increasingly aware oftheir infections.
