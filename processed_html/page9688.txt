Marietta real estate and business entrepreneur Rube McMullan announced the start of the Red Hare Brewery project, located in the southeast North Carolina coastal town of Shallotte. The brewery will be built in a 100-plus year old building that is part of a larger tract of property owned by McMullan, which will include additional retail and restaurant space. The project adjoins another McMullan historic rehab project, home of the very popular Wing  &  Fish Company. Marietta-based Red Hare Brewery is owned by Roger Davis and will provide Red Hare expansion into the growing North Carolina craft beer market. The project is part of an expanding presence of McMullan in the Shallotte/Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina market, which includes the Ocean Isle Fishing Center, a fishing oriented marina that includes a charter and commercial fishing fleet, various water sports activities, clothing and gift shop, fishing tackle and marine supplies. It is also the home of the Ocean Isle Fish Company, the Giggling Mackerel Tiki Bar and the Liars Club Bar. Another significant McMullan project in the Ocean Isle Beach market is the Shallotte River Swamp Park, a nature oriented eco-park featuring the longest and tallest zip line course on the coast, a tree top aerial adventure park, swamp boat tours, an elevated swamp walk and the only alligator sanctuary park in North Carolina where nuisance alligators destined for euthanasia are provided a home.
