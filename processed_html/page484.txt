Follow Us I ve collected postcards for years now and sort of always felt bad that I didn t have a good place to display them but instead just kept them in a beat up vintage clarinet case that I had ripped the lining out of and painted the inside gold. Then I saw  Eat, Pray, Love  and there is a scene where Julia Roberts is looking through a large vintage suitcase filled with travel articles and National Geographics that she had been collecting. I instantly related and realized that my little clarinet case full of postcards sent from around the world was a perfectly acceptable way of keeping my collection. It was there for me to open and peruse whenever I felt like. Further inspired by the film, I dug out all of the travel articles, clippings, books and maps I have saved and piled them in a vintage suitcase and now I too have a packed suitcase ready to travel wherever my daydreams take me. Suitcase and similar ones like it can be found at  Mackey Blue . I ve also always admired the beautiful Indian patchwork file folder from  Wisteria  and something like this would be great for a more organized collection. Images: 1  &  2   Sparrow King
