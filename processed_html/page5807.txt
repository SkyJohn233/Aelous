Ok so when I was asked if I was looking for the right guy or right girl I chose right guy because there was no third choice like the right someone no matter the gender. I'm I still going to be able to date girls too or I'm I stuck with just guys? Also where do you meet more people? I've been to some of the hangout places and they're always empty Answer from: Briar I had the same reaction. I always hate getting that sort of question lol. Thankfully, you can flirt/date with whoever you want to in the game. For some reason, you aren't able to meet people towards the beginning of the game, but you're definitely able to later on. Hope I helped!
