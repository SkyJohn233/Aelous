Anil Sinanan                                             This dynamic Hindi action extravaganza boosts its potent story with an aggressive style that will ensure audiences feel every blow.                                     Russell Edwards                                             Agneepath's success is in Karan Malhotra's conscious decision to embrace the thing that makes Bollywood masala so appealing, the spectacle.                                     J Hurtado                                             There's both style and craft in the way [director Karan Malhotra] builds the film's opening and closing scenes.                                     Avijit Ghosh                                             Would this movie have the same impact on the young as did Anand's incredible Hum for the generation before? No. Would this Agneepath suffice still? Yes.                                     Mayank Shekhar                                             While the carnage of incessant blood-letting and murderous stabbing is at times draining, the film remains captivating from start to finish.                                     Priya Joshi                                             A large part of the enjoyment I found in the film came from watching a bunch of actors going through their parts not with a knowing nudge-and-wink, but in all earnestness.                                     Shubhra Gupta                                             Agneepath is cinema of excess.                                     Namrata Joshi                                             A film completely relentless both in its often grim grittiness and uncompromising artistic vision.                                     Michael Dequina                                             Debut director Malhotra pays tribute with a stylish and visually rich remake of the 1990s' film of the same name.                                     Manish Gajjar                                             This sprawling 172-minute remake of Yash Johar's widely-acclaimed 1990 original is a feast for the eyes, a slight strain on the ears and frustratingly difficult to connect with.
