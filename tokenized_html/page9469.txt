midpoint of a line segment here the point 12,5 is 12 units along and 5 units up we can use cartesian coordinates to locate a point by how far along and how far up it is and when we know both end points of a line segment we can find the midpoint m try dragging the blue circles the midpoint is halfway between the two end points to calculate it as a formula m x a +x b 2 y a +y b 2 use the formula m x a +x b 2 y a +y b 2 m 3 +8 2 5+ 1 2 m 5/2 4/2 m 2.5 2
