Killua Zoldyck | Wiki | Hunter x Hunter Amino Name: Killua Zoldyck Age: 14 Killua is one of the main characters of Hunter x Hunter who sets off to become a Pro Hunter because he hates being in the “family business”. This is Gon's best friend from there very first meeting. He is from a family of assassins and is meant to be the heir until he runs away to become a hunter. Like Gon is he is a very young when he takes his first hunter exam but at the start he had more knowledge and strength then Gon. His personality is cheerful in most cases but can easily switch to very serious and defensive when he senses danger. He also has his own set unique knowledge set. It being more with ways to kill people or badly hurt them... but knowledge is power and in his case his way of surviving. Though this may seem like he is a very scary person Killua can actually be kind and a very caring person. Him caring the most about Gon rather than his own family. Killua's unique attacks are called “Thunder Palm” and “Gods Speed”. Which are all lightning based. Hm, he looks familiar Killua and Gon were 12 at the beginning and 14 at the end. But in Gons wiki, you put that he was 11. Tf The gon favorite wasnt made by me if you look. Killua is twelve too By anime or manga standards? This isnt based off the anime he ages in the manga. Its on the wiki if you wanna check. So. Fucking. Adorable!!! Also, Killugon Ftw!!! cause Gon says he is 12 and Killua says 'same age as me' Into Hunter x Hunter?Join the community.
