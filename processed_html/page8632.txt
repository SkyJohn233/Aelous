France’s second city may not have an Eiffel Tower but it has a joyous character and vibrant style in abundance. It’s full of more restaurants, shops and galleries than anyone will have time to visit. Add in the Mediterranean climate and interesting coastline and beaches, and you have all the ingredients of a great destination. Even better, Marseilles stands right between the Cote D’Azur and the Camargue, two of the best tourist regions in France, so it’s the perfect base for touring the sights of the region. It’s has been a major port on the Mediterranean for centuries and has grown back into the hills from its historic waterfront. This old harbour was used by the Romans 2,000 years ago and is still the natural heart of the city. You’ll see that images of Marseilles always feature the water, the boats and the old quayside buildings. In this lively area you can wander round the old Victorian stone lighthouse, travel across the harbour on the historic ferry and step inside one of France’s oldest church, the Abbey of St Victor which dates back to the 5th Century. The old port is also the best place to catch boat trips to outlying islands or sightseeing along the coast. Leading back from the quay is the Canebière, the main street of the city. Some call it the Champs Elysee of Marseilles and you’ll find grand shops and places to eat along this colourful tree-lined street. Head uphill to find the Panier district of narrow streets, hidden squares and pavement cafes. To the west is the mouth of the River Rhone in the unique delta landscape of the Camargue. This protected Nature Park is an inspiring flat landscape famous for the roaming herds of white horses. Nearby is the pretty town of Arles, made famous by a Vincent Van Goch painting ‘Café Terrace at Night’, and you can still visit the café he painted in 1888. It’s a short drive inland along the Rhone to Avignon, with its unfinished bridge and imposing papal palace. To the east, you can drive from Marseilles to the resorts of the Riviera. Glamorous St Tropez, affluent Antibes and charming Nice are all within reach. Even the tiny principality of Monaco with its billionaires’ yachts, world-famous casino and Michelin-starred restaurants is within a half-day’s drive.

Please note that from 15 Nov to 15 Apr many cities are required by law to restrict the circulation to only vehicles equipped with snow chains or winter tyres. For a summary of the orders, please visit  www.poliziadistato.it . To comply with the regulations, in specific  locations subject to this requirement , vehicles are equipped with snow chains - the price is included in the rental charges through the cost of "Winterization Fee". At pick-up if you decide to bring your own snow chains or do not intend on driving on the roads subject to this requirement, you may decline the equipment by signing the appropriate release form. This change will be reflected in the rental charges. For more information on the fees, please  click here . In all other regions, we recommend that you check before renting if your journey includes one of the roads subject to this requirement and therefore request the snow chains, if necessary.
