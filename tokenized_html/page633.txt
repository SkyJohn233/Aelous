bubble_full bubble_full bubble_full bubble_full bubble_empty this is my 3rd trip back to shangri la rasa sayang penang i enjoyed my stay mostly the local staff are very attentive and always has a smile on their face only thing that bothered me was the foreign waiter at the spice garden cafe during our breakfast which i dreaded each morning not accommodating at all he did not even make any effort and just gave excuses on our request for a simple thing as a chair cushion collected our plates without even asking if we even finished which left us speechless for a 5 star resort i would have appreciated to see local faces rather than foreign ones who are rude special thanks to local staff at the spice garden and rasa lounge who are friendly and accommodating throughout our stay bubble_full bubble_full bubble_full bubble_full bubble_full we stayed in a garden room in the rasa wing it was a beautiful room with a gorgeous garden the rasa lounge cocktail hour was very nice too really nice wine choices and tasty nibbles it s just a shame they don t let it run for 2 hours until 7-30pm best thing about the rasa wing is the quiet adults only pool staff there are amazing bringing food and drinks and clean towels we were tired one night and ordered penang specialities from room service they were really good and excellent price hainanese chicken was especially good great choice for breakfast we loved our stay and could not fault it staff make your stay special every person we were served by was so friendly and helpful penang is a beautiful island with lots to see and do we will be back for sure and will definitely stay at the shangri-la again bubble_full bubble_full bubble_full bubble_full bubble_empty the staff are lovely and ca n't be faulted however we did n't have a trouble free stay the plumbing in the rasa wing was decidely odd and one night we could only flush the toilet with a bucket of water handily provided by the housekeeping staff there were extensive renovations taking place on the third floor and the stench was unbelievable this did restrict the use of our balcony to some extent when sat around the rasa wing pool there was a fair amount of noise from the renovations taking place at the spa too the buffet in the spice market cafe was ok but not particularly good for the price one evening we walked to the golden sands next door and were caught in a thunderstorm we asked their reception if we could borrow an umberella the concierge was very surly and made us sign a loan agreement we thought they were both shangri la hotels
