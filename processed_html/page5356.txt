Romani Mexicans - Wikipedia There is a significant  Roma  population in  Mexico , most being the descendants of past migrants. According to data collected by the  National Institute of Statistics and Geography  in 2000, they numbered 15,850, [ 1 ]  however, the total number is likely larger. [ 1 ]  In Mexico, they are commonly known as  gitanos  or  rom . The first gypsy group in Mexico were the Spanish  gitanos  that arrived during the  Colonial era .  Some of the mid-19th century migrants may have arrived to Mexico via  Argentina . [ 2 ] In the late 19th and early 20th century migrants from  Hungary ,  Poland  and  Russia  began arriving. [ 1 ]  In 1931, after a substantial colony of these latter gypsies had settled, and following complaints of delinquency, the law was changed to prohibit further settlement in Mexico. [ 1 ] According to the  Joshua Project , there are 51,000 Romani/ Vlax  in Mexico (85% are Christian). [ 3 ] In the mid 1900s, Romani caravans were known for showing movies in rural towns ( cine ambulante , traveling cinema). Today, their economic activities mainly revolve around the sale of textiles, cars, trucks and jewelry and also the teaching of singing and dancing. [ 1 ]  As a result of adoption of  Evangelical Protestantism , there has been an almost complete abandonment of  fortune telling  as a profession among the Romani of Mexico City. [ 4 ]
