review lapidus pour homme black extreme by ted lapidus i x27 m bored and so lonely tonight fragrance if you x27 ve been following my reviews and postings on this sub you may have noticed that i x27 m a fan of many older scents especially powerhouses however there are some classics that either due to poor timing cost or reformulations that i just never got a chance to experience properly lapidus pour homme was one of them i recently acquired a sample of the newest version but that x27 s the subject of another review the thing is the lapidus house has put out several well reviewed fragrances but for some reason it x27 s another one of those houses that i just never bothered to investigate never too late to fix a minor problem like that though if you read the reviews on basenotes and fragrantica the current version of lapidus is torn asunder as an emasculated version of the original apparently the vintage form was an atomic bomb of a scent with character longevity and enough of a unique smell to be somewhat polarizing not talking kouros levels here but the honey note was described as urinous in several reviews however the newer release of black extreme has garnered praise as a strong and unique scent that doesn x27 t smell quite like the original but does carry it x27 s dna and takes it in a new direction instead of incense black extreme has a heavy dose of florals i have a giant hard on for floral notes in men x27 s scents so i was eager to explore this scent the notes from fragrantica are as follows top notes include black pepper citrus and violet leaves saffron and woody notes give a refinement to the heady orange blossom heart notes of labdanum and tonka form the dark base of this fragrance the opening of black extreme is rough and quite simply the worst part of the fragrance normally i don x27 t mind a bracing opening but the top notes here are harsh the black pepper and citrus don x27 t mix well the citrus here isn x27 t orange or lemon it x27 s more pineapple like but in a sickly way oh god pineapple means it x27 s aventus all aboard the hype train choo choo assholes ahem pepper with lemon gives an old school astringent opening which can be pleasant and refreshing here though it smells a little like a toilet cleaner it x27 s highly synthetic and just not that pleasant mercifully this dies down rather quickly say 5 to 10 minutes a sweet gentle floral heart then emerges this portion of the drydown is a beguiling mix of violets and orange blossom it x27 s velvety smooth and soothing think sculpture and fleur de male mixed with the strong violets of grey flannel or fahrenheit it x27 s fantastic and once again proof that florals do belong in men x27 s scents saffron is also present adding a slightly dusty and creamy floral vibe the best part of the fragrance is the 3 to 4 hour time period where the mid notes are still detectable and the base notes are emerging tonka smells like vanilla mixed with almonds or cherries labdanum is a very interesting note that i don x27 t think is used or pushed to the forefront of scents enough on it x27 s own it smells like a dirty amber or light ambergris but with chocolate/cocoa on top so the drydown becomes a mix of flowers and sweet vanilla and amber with chocolate cherries and nuts mixed in the scent has been described as a floral oriental or floriental i would argue that the food qualities of labdanum and tonka it x27 s almost a gourmand in the base so it x27 s more of a floral gourmand longevity is great easy ten hours and projection is strong this is a big scent people will know what you are wearing and the sillage is strong and tenacious too if you are looking to make a statement this is a good choice the quality to cost ratio makes this a very attractive option for cold weather you can find a 3.4oz bottle for 25 dollars without looking too hard all in all it x27 s a worthy addition to any wardrobe the combination of floral and gourmand notes are superb in cold weather the only knock against it is the opening i can understand why there aren x27 t that many reviews of the fragrance many people probably judged it based on the first few minutes and scrubbed it i wouldn x27 t entirely blame them but they missed out where to wear it romantic settings it x27 s a little too look at me for the office but it invites attention making it a good choice for romantic encounters the strong projection also makes it a good choice for clubbing who can wear it patient men who are confident enough in their masculinity to give flowers a chance if you make it past the initial ten minutes you x27 re golden wear this not that i x27 ve pretty much mentioned the main competition in the heart of the review fleur du male sculpture fahrenheit and grey flannel are all florals in a similar vein for a similar vibe jpg le male joop pour homme and one man show ruby edition by bogart would be comparable for big sweet scents with strong floral notes if you would like to try another violet scent that is more dry and woody lalique hommage a l x27 homme is a superb choice the notes contain saffron tonka bean labdanum violets and pepper as well just based on the breakdown you can see there are some similarities however the lalique scent is a more office friendly scent sort of a more reserved kissing cousin no comments yet be the first to share what you think
