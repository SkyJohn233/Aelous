WWE TLC Matches: The Top 10 Underrated in History - Page 11 WWE 2015 This is another match I m hesitant to label  underrated,  but considering how close this match came to being a five star classic and how little it s talked about to this day, it s definitely deserving of its spot on this list. And to think this match was made official only one week before 2012 s TLC pay-per-view event because CM Punk was sidelined with an injury. The Shield s problems were with Ryback more so than Team Hell No, but that didn t prevent the WWE Tag Team champions from taking the fight to the hottest stars on the scene. What ensued was absolute anarchy. From The Shield delivering a powerbomb to Ryback to Seth Rollins crashing through a table at the top of the stage, nothing was off limits for the six competitors. In their WWE debut match, The Shield reigned supreme, leaving a lasting impact that s still being felt by fans. WWE 2015 < \/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t < \/div>\n\t\t\n Hidden Remote s Graham  GSM  Matthews ranks ten matches from WWE TLC s past that you may have missed. < \/strong> < \/em> < \/h2>\n In 2009, WWE s Tables, Ladders and Chairs match was given its own pay-per-view, which has since become a staple in the month of December. Of course, it has made the match less special as a result, but there s no denying that it s been a consistently entertaining event by and large for the past six years. < \/p>\n With the exception of the 2013 installment, every event has featured at least one Tables match, one Ladder match, one Chairs match, and one TLC match. Essentially, it s become WWE s version of the Demolition Derby. < \/p>\n TLC 2015 will be no different, as Sheamus and Roman Reigns will collide in a TLC match in the main event for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. It will also see a slew of other matches take place that are likely to steal the show. < \/p>\n The event is best remembered for bouts such as CM Punk vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. The Miz from 2011 and John Cena vs. Dolph Ziggler from 2012, but there have been other excellent outings that don t get the credit they deserve. Whether they re overshadowed by more memorable matches or featured on forgotten cards, they have earned the title of being under-appreciated classics. < \/p>\n As this year s installment draws near, we ll look at the top ten most underrated matches from the event s illustrious history. < \/p>\n Next:  < \/span> Natalya and Beth Phoenix vs. LayCool < \/span> < \/a> < \/div>
