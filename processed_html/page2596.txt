The Jon Anderson White Riverboat will have a new home at Saylorville Lake starting in the spring. (Photo: Register file photo) Buy Photo Lots of people have spied the sleek Jon Anderson White Riverboat cruising along the Des Moines River, but starting in the spring of 2015, it will have a new home at Saylorville Lake. "We were supposed to launch the boat this past summer at Saylorville Lake, but the flooding delayed those efforts," said Madeline Quick, office manager and event planner for Port of Des Moines, the limited liability corporation that owns the Jon Anderson White Riverboat. The paddle wheel riverboat has been offering dinner cruises and hosting private events like wedding receptions for 15 years. "We've even had the entire wedding on the boat," Quick said. "It's a pretty big boat." Quick spoke with The Des Moines Register about the riverboat business. Q: What types of cruises will the business host?  A: We will cruise around Saylorville Lake for public dinner cruises, as well as private dinner cruises, so people can book those, too. Q: When are the cruises held?  A: We can do daytime cruises, but they are primarily nighttime cruises. Q: What's on the menu?  A: We offer gourmet lunch and dinner cruises, as well as cocktail, wine and cheese cruises. Q: What's the boat's capacity?  A: It carries up to 75 guests. Q: How is the boat outfitted?  A: We offer full bar services, two restaurants and entertainment, including live music or a DJ. There is a dance floor. It's so cool-looking. Jon Anderson White Riverboat LOCATION: Saylorville Lake, Ankeny. HOURS: By appointment. BUSINESS HISTORY: The riverboat has been relocated from Des Moines to the Saylorville reservoir for the 2015 season. OWNER: Michael LaValle. CONTACT: 330-1517,  www.port-of-desmoines.com .
