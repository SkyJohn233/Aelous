promise you won t regret it by now you might be wondering how did you decide to put kimchi and avocado in grilled cheese how are you such a genius honestly i don t know except for the last part i d blame it on my excessive avocado intake avocados go good with just about everything so it was a no brainer to combine them with kimchi as for the grilled cheese part i just crossed my fingers and hoped for the best and boy was i happy with the result one of the most difficult parts about cooking is messing up the food with a simple mistake as i used my spatula to check on the crispiness of this sandwich i held it up just a little too high and the whole thing flipped over face-down in the pan just as i was ready to throw in the towel the kimchi started sizzling in the pan and it hit me i
