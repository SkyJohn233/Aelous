Three things we noticed at the Anthony Joshua versus Wladimir Klitschko press conference | Metro News 135.6 m  shares You could be forgiven for believing  Anthony Joshua  and  Wladimir Klitschko  when they tell you with a smile on their faces they are not interested in psyching each other out. But look a little closer and you’ll notice things were not quite as cosy as they seemed at the press conference on Wednesday. Joshua and Klitschko have already insisted the build-up to the mega clash at Wembley will be of a different kind to recent ill-tempered rivalries boxing fans have witnessed in recent months.

But there were moments of rivalry. Flashes of posturing. Shots were fired and here we go through a few things you possibly would’ve missed. The former heavyweight king of the world was quite giddy during press conference. Most of the event seemed to dominated by Klitschko’s voice as he began by laying out his five point plan. Klitschko seemed excited, but was his behaviour a minor indication the 30-year-old is feeling the pressure? Joshua:  18-0-KO18 Klitschko:  64-4-KO53 He is desperate to win, obsessed he said and losing to Joshua would truly represent a handing over the torch. That’s how Joshua sees it and Klitschko will too, should he lose. His demeanor at the press conference did not exactly represent a happy, focused fighter he surely intended to portray. Instead, he seemed animated and nervous, perhaps a man hoping his day in the limelight is not yet done? Make no mistake about it, Joshua knows exactly what Klitschko was up to. They may be swerving smack talk, but the heavyweights are not beyond posturing. Klitschko arrived first at the presser and remained standing until Joshua turned up. . @anthonyfjoshua  v  @Klitschko #JoshuaKlitschko pic.twitter.com/LNwriVrebc — Matchroom Boxing (@MatchroomBoxing)  December 14, 2016 When it was time to take the pictures, Klitschko took off his jacket so his arms would be exposed like Joshua and he did the same again for the pictures on the Wembley pitch. All this sizing up was not lost on Joshua, the young champion knew exactly what his old friend was doing. ‘Now you mention it, yes he was,’ said Joshua, asked about Klitschko’s flexing. ‘But I think he is calculated – I took my jacket off, so he took his jacket off. ‘If I put up my right hand, he put up his right hand.’ The Ukrainian spent much of the afternoon painting himself as the master, the expert and the champion about to fight the student, Joshua. Joshua’s general demeanor during press conferences is often to stare off into space as his opponents speak. He did not stray from his old habits and he certainly looked the bored student as Klitschko performed his soliloquy. I'm obsessed with my goal to become a three time world champion on April 29.  #TakeTheBiggestChallenge pic.twitter.com/5RuUCzfg8J — Klitschko (@Klitschko)  December 14, 2016 Eddie Hearn lashes out at Deontay Wilder after Anthony Joshua dig He did most of the talking during the press conference and reminded everyone he calls Joshua his ‘little brother’. A nickname laced with meaning for Klitschko. He may have sat on the left side like the challenger he is, but he presented himself to the watching crowd, and more importantly Joshua, as the champion. Neither boxer has done much trash talking in their careers, but don’t be fooled by the lovefest. The mind games are going on and both men know it.
