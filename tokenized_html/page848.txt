is just around the corner as well and many families stay home because the streets are too dark and they don t feel safe taking their children to enjoy the unofficial holiday there s also people who get out of work at 8 or 8:30 p.m. and want to walk their dogs or go out for a late-night jog the lighting in the streets isn t sufficient you never know what may pop out and what s in these streets many dangers include getting mugged or even beaten up lighting should be a priority for everyone s safety what if a child leaves their home and crosses the street without a parent realizing where their child is a car might not be able to see him someone may abduct the child a parent can go out and look for him but it s too dark lighting is a very important necessity we all need some may say there s no money to pay for more electricity but we may use solar panels during the day to use that extra electricity during the night time jacqueline silva east el paso more democrats need to get radical reader as a resident of tornillo texas my main concern for our community are the many flaws it has for instance our water is unacceptable and we mislay sidewalks in our neighborhoods we would appreciate some type of cooperation in our community to make our town more livable with this in mind the water is terrible and not drinkable sometimes our water is filthy and comes out of the faucet unclean it s so filthy that we are unable to wash our clothing we can t shower when the water is mucky and this type of water can lead to an infection at times we don t even have water making it hard for us to do our chores in addition tornillo itself doesn t have sidewalks for our neighborhood many people in our area go out for walks with their children and it is dangerous kids walk home from school as cars pass by our children are very important and their safety is our first concern as a community we always want to feel comfortable and of course safe our surroundings matter especially for the children we will cherish some changes in our community as soon as possible abigail fierro tornillo texas more beto o'rourke admits 'take-a-knee stance upset close friend on 'the ellen degeneres show i am 87 years old and a veteran of the korean war like a multitude of other veterans i have been reading with interest about all the disrespect given our flag and our country i feel that i must also offer a statement of my own i proudly wore the uniform of the u.s. army and along with many million others i served our wonderful country i noticed that football uniforms are the only uniforms worn by those disrespecting our country those of us who have served with honor have a piece of paper called form dd 214 that form shows that we risked our lives for very little money the disrespecters have a piece of paper called a contract that most likely indicates that they are worth millions and some are even called heroes just for playing a sport i have rubbed shoulders with many real heroes who have fought and died to guarantee these people the right to kneel and shake their fists when our national anthem is played our representative beto o rourke has recently stated that he condones such disrespect unbelievable george marlow northeast el paso
