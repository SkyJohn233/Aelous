The objective of the sport is for the attacker or "raider" to go into the opponent half, and tag out the "defenders". The defenders, in turn, try to tackle their attackers and prevent them from returning to the other half. The sport has gained a lot of popularity, especially in India recently, due to the advent of the Pro Kabaddi League, and has become one of the fastest growing sports in the world.
