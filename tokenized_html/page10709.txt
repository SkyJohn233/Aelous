the first case of a neonate with concurrent chiari ii malformation and achondroplasia although rare both these conditions contribute to several deleterious anatomical changes at the cervicomedullary junction and thus predispose to acute hydrocephalus although our patient was initially asymptomatic hydrocephalus ensued several weeks after birth and required cerebral spinal fluid diversion we discuss the potential links between the two conditions the pathophysiology and the important clinical implications for the management of the increased risk of hydrocephalus core tip achondroplasia and chiari ii malformations can induce similar anatomical changes at the cervicomedullary junction which increase the risk of acute hydrocephalus chiari decompression may not always be necessary however diligent and acute follow-up is important to monitor for signs of impeding hydrocephalus if cerebral spinal fluid diversion is required remember that shunt failure is common in the pediatric age group and also requires close follow-up achondroplasia is the most common cause of dwarfism occurring at a frequency of 1 and 26000 live births 1 mutations of the fgfr3 gene which encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor that is deferentially expressed during various stages of development are responsible for the characteristic short-stature and macrocephaly 2 3 the condition follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with complete penetrance however 80 -90 of cases are due to sporadic mutation 1 4 the fgfr3 gene has been mapped to chromosome 4p16.3 and is part of a larger family of fibroblast growth factor receptor genes which play important roles in skeletal development 2 3 the chiari ii malformation cm ii is a well characterized congenital malformation of the central nervous system although the exact mechanism is still disputed the condition is defined by a small posterior fossa and caudal displacement of the brainstem and cerebellum through the foramen magnum 5 in addition all cases of cm ii are associated with a myelomeningocele 5 which can be further complicated by hydrocephalus syringomyelia heterotopias and agenesis of the corpus callosum are only some of the commonly reported sequelae 5 7 in our literature review we found two case reports of patients with both achondroplasia and chiari i malformations 8 9 however to our knowledge there are no published case reports of concomitant achondroplasia and cm ii here we report the first such case in a neonate and discuss the potential links between the two conditions the pathophysiology and the management of the increased risk of hydrocephalous a 1 d old male born after 39-3/7 wk of gestation to a 39-year-old gravid 1 para 0 women presented after delivery for surgical correction of a sacral mass during pregnancy an elevated afp was noted and ultrasound findings demonstrated enlarged ventricles large for gestational age status and a sacral myelomeningocele the infant was delivered via cesarean section with no complications at birth 1 and 5 min apgars were 8 and 9 respectively the child x02019 s cranium appeared relatively macrocephalic and measured in the 75 th percentile with a short cranial base and mild frontal bossing a 7 cm x000d7 7 cm sacral myelomeningocele was noted and no cerebral spinal fluid csf leak was evident the extremities showed shortening of the femurs and humeri with relatively long fibulae and a trident confirmation of the hands the patient had a short stature with an upper-lower segment ratio of 1.9 normal 1.6 to 1.7 these exam findings initiated a genetic and skeletal survey for achondroplasia the remainder of the physical and neurological exam were normal an axial t-2 magnetic resonance image mri of the head showed no signs of hydrocephalus figure x200b figure1a 1a there was no evidence of a tonsillar herniation however a tight cervicomedullary junction was noted on the sagittal t-1 mri of the head figure x200b figure1b 1b and the lateral and third ventricles were slightly enlarged the corpus callosum and cerebral vermis were noted to be hypoplastic and a small posterior fossa with frontal bossing were evident a sagittal t-2 mri of the spine figure x200b figure1c 1c demonstrated a well circumscribed hyperintense sacral mass protruding dorsally with a loss of posterior spinal elements distal to l3 there was some evidence of cauda equina involvement and tethering of the cord the patient x02019 s radiographic and physical exam findings were consistent with a cm ii the patient was taken to the operating room on the same day of presentation to undergo repair of the myelomeningocele a typical elliptical incision was made adjacent to the defect with midline extension caudal and rostral to the dome the myelomeningocele was delicately dissected away from the dome skin and the surrounding fascial and dural layers the termination of the placode was detethered from the dome skin and the dorsal and ventral nerve roots were mobilized laterally the lateral edges of the placode were approximated and sutured to form a closed cavity the dura was then closed and no signs of csf leak were evident after valsalva finally the fascial layers and skin were re-approximated some trimming of the excess skin was necessary the operation was completed without complications and the patient x02019 s recovery was monitored in the neonatal intensive care unit a genetic evaluation for achondroplasia was positive for a mutation of the fgfr3 gene on chromosome 4 showed a glycine to arginine substation mutation at the 380 th amino acid residue confirming a diagnosis of achondroplasia it was not immediately clear if the cm ii was related to the patients x02019 concomitant achondroplasia the patient was monitored post-operatively for 6 d. during that period the fontanelles remained soft and there were no signs of increased intracranial pressure icp the patients x02019 family was counseled on the symptoms of hydrocephalous and the patient was discharged home with instructions to follow up in 2 wk in the subsequent weeks the patient had bi-weekly clinical and ultrasound exams which were normal at 8 wk however the patients head circumference was in the 97 th percentile the anterior fontanelle was full and pulsatile with signs of sagittal suture splaying but the patient had no signs of respiratory distress a t2 mri figure x200b figure2a 2a showed evidence of ventriculomegaly with increased extra-axial spacing given the physical exam and radiographic findings we placed a ventriculoperitoneal vp shunt in the right lateral ventricle without incident after discharge the patient was monitored with serial mris figure x200b figure2b 2b c which demonstrated subtle but continued ventriculomegaly during this time the patient was asymptomatic and had normal exam findings four months following shunt placement the patient was found to have an enlarged head circumference that measured above the 95 th percentile the patient was reported to be less active than usual and the anterior fontanelle was full but soft a t-2 mri demonstrated the vp shunt catheter was no longer in the lateral ventricle subsequently the lateral and third ventricle had enlarged figure x200b figure2d 2d and there was evidence of encroachment of the cerebellar tonsils into the spinal canal the patient required shut revision which was completed without complications at the time of the shunt revision somatosensory evoked potentials were within normal limits and chiari decompression was not carried out the patient is now 10 mo old and we continue to monitor his head circumference which has stabilized since shunt revision embryogenesis is a complex physiologic phenomenon that is subject to a wide range of exogenous and endogenous forces that can have significant impact on developmental outcomes at times these changes are so gross they can be detected in-utero as in the case of a cm ii in which a myelomeningocele is evident in pre-partum ultrasound conversely in conditions like achondroplasia developmental changes become apparent shortly after birth although the exact mechanism by which these effects take place are not entirely delineated understanding them is crucial to the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies as in our case almost all cases of achondroplasia are due to a substitution mutation of the 380 th amino acid gly for an arg residue which resides in the transmembrane domain of the receptor protein 2 3 gene expression studies in mice have shown elevated levels of mrna encoding the fgfr3 protein in the rudimentary cartilage of all premature bone during organogenesis 10 the effects of achondroplasia on the developing calvarium can produce signs and symptoms similar to those seen in cm ii in addition to the characteristic macrocephalic changes commonly seen changes in the shape and size of the foramen magnum cervical stenosis cervicomedullary compression and upward herniation of the brainstem are common 8 11 although there are several proposed hypotheses describing the pathogenesis of cm ii the exact mechanism remains elusive animal models have demonstrated that open neural tube defects ntd are causative in the case of cm ii ntd that were surgically created in mouse rat and sheep models replicate the hindbrain herniation through the foramen magnum that is stereotypical of cm ii 12 14 this finding has two important implications firstly it lends considerable evidence to the widely accepted x0201c unified theory x0201d of cm ii 6 this theory alleges the loss of csf through the open caudal ntd causes a subsequent drop in icp this loss of pressure at a critical point during fetal development results in poor cranial vault expansion culminating into a small posterior fossa the unexpectedly narrowed posterior fossa leads to the caudal displacement of the brainstem and cerebellum through the foramen magnum 6 secondly the causal relationship of ntd and cm ii has valuable corollaries for prevention folic acid supplementation has been found to reduce the incidence of ntd by 70 15 the incidence of cm ii has not been well studied to determine whether the expected decrease exists following the increased use of folic acid supplementation due to the association of folic acid and ntd there has been considerable research evaluating the role of enzymes and transport proteins involved in its metabolism namely mtrr mthfd1 and folr1-2 16 however these genes appear to have little relation to those of achondroplasia and make up only a small portion of candidate genes the genetic causes of ntd appear to be far more complex and varied than originally anticipated over 200 gene mutations in mice are known to cause ntd 17 similarly in humans ntd defects arise in the setting of multiple syndromes pallister-hall walker-warburg and fanconi anemia among others and chromosomal abnormalities including trisomies 13 and 18 18 20 of the wide range of potential gene candidates we focused on reports of mutations involving chromosome 4 where the fgfr3 gene is located in a small series of 5 autopsy reports of fetuses with wolf-hirschhorn syndrome due to partial mutations deletion/substitution of the short arm of chromosome 4 three patients had sacral dimples while 2 had partial or complete agenesis of the corpus callosum all patients exhibited growth retardation and had consistent craniofacial abnormalities including frontal bossing 21 furthermore reports of achondroplasia and other spinal dysraphisms exist including tethered cords and lipomas indicating the range of phenotypes that ensue from genetic mutations in this region 22 23 familial studies of chiari malformations are limited mainly to chiari i malformations as such the genetics of cm ii are not as well characterized animal models have suggested possible gene candidates the splotch mouse model for example can produce ntd and the hindbrain herniation characteristic of the cm ii 6 the genetic mutation responsible for this phenotype in mouse models was mapped to the human pax -3 gene on chromosome 1 encodes transcription factors which play various roles in embryogenesis 24 25 further studies in humans however demonstrated that mutations in pax-3 generate distinct features not commonly seen in cm ii namely deafness and abnormal pigmentation which were later characterized into a distinct waardenburg syndrome 25 26 given our patients x02019 concurrent conditions the concern for hydrocephalus was high brainstem herniation as a result of hydrocephalus in both cm ii and achondroplasia can be acutely progressive and greatly increases the risk of apneic spells and acute respiratory failure 1 11 27 at the time of presentation we believed the degree of cervicomedullary constriction present did not warrant surgical chiari decompression as a result the patient underwent myelomeningocele repair with acute follow-up although our patient ultimately required csf diversion there were no overt signs of respiratory distress spasticity or dysphagia which would warrant a surgical chiari decompression in a large series of 148 patients with cm ii only 14 of patients required surgical decompression 7 treating the obstructive hydrocephalus by shutting is a more common method that is associated with fewer risks in a series of 71 cases of cm ii 64 90 patients had hydrocephalus 89 of which required vp shunting 28 as in our case shunt placement necessitates close follow-up and thorough patient education unfortunately our patient experienced shunt failure due to tip migration a risk associated with this treatment a large series of 1015 patients who underwent vp shunting reported a failure rate of 46.3 in the pediatric group however failure rates were reported to be 79.2 the majority of which occurred in the first 6 mo 29 importantly in patients with spinal dysraphisms as in our case failure rates were 84.8 29 at last follow up 10 mo the patient was symptom free with signs of improved csf outflow due to the compounding effects of both underlying conditions on the potential hydrocephalus we continue to monitor the patient with routine monthly follow-up in conclusion both achondroplasia and the cm ii are relatively common as independent conditions however they very rarely occur concomitantly importantly the cm ii is a consequence of ntds which appear to have multifocal genetic and environmental etiologies although the genes involved in achondroplasia appear to be distinct from those of the cm ii due to the complexity of embryologic development there may be key interactions between the downstream pathways which may account for some of the similar anatomic changes seen at the cervicomedullary junction as such the management of the potential hydrocephalus that may arise within patients with this unique predisposition requires acute and diligent follow up and patient education a newborn boy presented with macrocephaly short limbs and a sacral mass concurrent achondroplasia and chiari ii malformation myelomeningocele has a unique gross presentation however a sacrococcygeal teratoma should be considered and the two conditions can be easily differentiated using magnetic resonance imaging the differential of a newborn with macrocephaly is quite large and includes congenital infections obstructive hydrocephalus metabolic conditions canavan x02019 s disease alexander x02019 s disease etc and osteogenensis imperfecta are only a few to consider a genetic test indicated a missense mutation of the fgfr3 gene on chromosome 4 confirming a diagnosis of achondroplasia mri of the head and spinal column confirmed a diagnosis of chiari ii malformation surgical myelomeningocele repair and ventriculoperitoneal shunting due to hydrocephalous is a standard treatment this is the first reported case of both a chiari ii malformation and achondroplasia in the same patient cases of concurrent chiari i malformation and achondroplasia have been reported in references 7 and 8 spina bifida is an incomplete closure of the spine during embryogenesis a myelomeningocele is a form of spina bidifia that includes a herniation of the spinal meninges through the spinal defect shunt failure is more common in pediatric patients with spinal dysraphisms generally occurring within the
