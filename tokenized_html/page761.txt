efforts in the country 's south was killed by his own bodyguards in pursuit of a bounty offered by the united states the head of the military said yesterday abdul basit usman a militant with strong al-qaeda links who was blamed for numerous bomb attacks in the southern philippines had been hunted by security forces since 2002. there was in-fighting among his group general gregorio pio catapang told journalists at the main army base in manila. reports reaching this headquarters revealed that usman and five of his unidentified cohorts were killed in a shoot-out allegedly with fellow members of his group. catapang said he had information that usman 's followers had turned on him because of a us 1 million bounty offered by the us state department without elaborating but his account was contradicted by the country 's largest muslim rebel group the moro islamic liberation front milf which said its fighters killed the renegade usman. we can confirm that usman is dead and his body was buried in accordance with muslim tradition milf vice-chairman ghazali jaafar said the milf 's chief peace negotiator mohagher iqbal said usman was killed by its forces when he resisted arrest in march last year the philippines signed a peace deal with the milf ending about 45 years of conflict that has killed 120,000 people and displaced two million but the rebels will not lay down weapons until after a final peace deal is reached they are waiting for manila to set up a new muslim autonomous government in the south granting wider powers over its economy politics and social life catapang said usman was travelling with seven bodyguards towards a rebel camp in guindulungan town on the southern island of mindanao when a firefight erupted within his group. the bodies were discovered by moro islamic liberation front rebels he said adding that the army and police units were trying to establish the identities of the slain militants the milf 's chief peace negotiator mohagher iqbal said that usman was killed by its forces when he resisted arrest usman 's group was intercepted by rebel forces near a creek at around 10.30am on sunday but chose to shoot it out rather than be taken to the guerrilla 's main camp he said both catapang and iqbal said that usman 's death would be a boost to continuing peace efforts. our security operations will continue until we get all the potential spoilers to the peace process catapang said adding there were still 10 foreign islamist militants and about 100 local renegade islamist militants in the south security forces had been hunting usman accused of repeated bomb attacks in the southern philippines since he escaped from a january police raid that killed malaysian zulkifli bin hir an alleged bomb maker who was the subject of a us 5-million american government bounty the january raid also led to the death of 44 police commandoes as rebels fought back setting peace efforts the milf has since then been under pressure to show it is a reliable peace partner the us state department 's website describes usman as a bomb-making expert with links to the jemaah islamiyah and abu sayyaf group terrorist organisations leading him to be considered a threat to american and filipino citizens and interests dpa published 2:53pm 14 dec 2019 updated 2:54pm 14 dec 2019 top picks this week in asia from indians to chinese singapore feels the

advocating for land and labour rights were described by an army public affairs chief on november 2 as a product of thorough intelligence operations they were part of a series of counter-insurgency

to the city state days after the video went viral hundreds of demonstrators turned up at a rally protesting against ceca and singapore s population growth this public anger was reminiscent of that seen in 2013 when the government issued a projection that singapore s population could hit 6.9 million by 2030 the number currently stands at 5.7 million roughly 1.7 million of whom are foreigners over the past month the authorities have attempted to quell the disquiet by making multiple clarifications about the case the man ramesh erramalli was born in india but is a naturalised singaporean with a singaporean wife his education certificates were real ceca did not make it easy for indians to gain entry to the country for work nor would any free-trade agreement the government said the display of xenophobia is not new to singapore foreigners – from mainland chinese to filipinos – have been blamed for a range of problems including overcrowding on public transport and unemployment but the discomfort with those of indian ethnicity has been shaped by the influx of educated foreign professionals over the last two decades working in sectors ranging from finance to technology for indian national nandita gupta 36 who moved to singapore in 2010 and works as a designer at an international school it is a fallacy that the floodgates are open for foreigners she said recruiters had told her it was hard to find jobs for overseas applicants gupta has applied for permanent residency but without success since 2011 when immigration became an election issue singapore has tightened requirements for foreigners looking to relocate there the number of employment passes – issued to foreign professionals managers executives and technicians – approved each year slowed to an average of 3,000

in singapore can monster malls scare retail woes away read more if singapore is so wealthy why do its citizens feel stuck but the fact that erramalli is a citizen has not appeased singaporeans like gilbert goh who organised the anti-ceca protest i think he s a new citizen and i don t think he blended in he didn t integrate well goh said echoing the views of most respondents in a survey by the institute of policy studies research centre close to seven in 10 of 4,015 citizens and permanent residents polled thought immigrants were not doing enough to integrate into singapore trinity joan an administrator for a start-up said the anger towards erramalli was not race-based but rather about nationalism we need to protect our own if someone misbehaves and is not from our country we need to have a sense of nationalism and say you disrespected a singaporean so you re out the 30-year-old said race and citizenship singapore indians were among those who raged against erramalli in private gatherings and on social media their feelings fuelled by the perception that these new migrants tend to look down on them as national university of singapore historian john solomon recounted in a 2016 book on the indian diaspora members of the tamil community have expressed concern about the appearance of caste names in wedding and funeral announcements in singapore s only tamil-language newspaper whether or not new immigration from india is indeed bringing about a gradual revival in caste identities in singapore the growth of this perception has manifested itself in popular xenophobic stereotypes about the new indian migrant as an exporter of atavistic and backward social ideas he wrote kumaran pillai publisher of current affairs website the independent news said recent indian migrants tended to have their own enclaves they hang around and move in their own circles they rarely mix and talk with locals pillai said asked where this perception came from he gave anecdotes pillai said indian immigrants often cut queues because they are richer or hold a better position it was common to see foreigners being rude to service staff he added they re perceived as a bit uppity those in management positions it s not caste it s class consciousness pillai said he also gave examples in which singaporean-indian women had supposedly been judged by immigrant colleagues over practices deemed unacceptable in india such as wearing short skirts or enjoying a drink in a bar with male co-workers mengi felt it had been difficult to make friends with locals when he first arrived in the city state mainly because life was busy and most citizens already had a well-established circle of friends small cultural differences also played a part mengi realised that the way he used language growing up was totally unacceptable in singapore if you tell somebody no la can not be la can not where i come from we d say aiya shut up la when i first said shut up to somebody everybody stopped dead in their tracks. in a research paper published two years ago nanyang technological university sociologist laavanya kathiravelu said divisions between recent immigrants and long-time residents had superseded the social divides once thought the most insurmountable – those of race she wrote that singapore s racial mix had barely changed in 15 years owing to careful immigration controls but although racial harmony had been maintained intra-racial tensions had intensified kathiravelu said the state should move towards dismantling ethnic classifications and must encourage healthy discussion about race she also believed the basis of the singaporean national identity needed to change to become truly multicultural and multiracial the national integration council set up in 2009 to help foreigners and singaporeans mix said integration was a process that involved everyone foreigners should learn respect and adapt to our country s culture and norms … they need time to adapt residents can help them by reaching out to neighbours the council said tan ern ser a sociologist at the national university of singapore said any xenophobia would only subside when foreigners are no longer seen as a threat or unfair competitors when their behaviour is consistent with local norms when they are not seen as taking advantage of singapore – and more generally when singaporeans feel less insecure for mengi the onus is on the immigrant to learn about the country and make an effort to fit in something he has endeavoured to do i ve spent more time in singapore than anywhere else including the place i was born so i can t be anything else sometimes people ask where i would retire and i find this question bizarre where would i go i don t really know anything else. ■ read

year from february to september even as the retail vacancy rate held steady at about 7.5 per cent between the year s second and third quarters part of the problem has been the economy growth has slowed to a crawl with the economy expected to expand by between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent this year with their incomes stretched shoppers are pulling back but a far bigger problem for most retailers has been the rise of e-commerce people are now buying everything from coconuts to computers on e-commerce sites such as lazada amazon and taobao mall developers have tried to stem the tide by bringing in new restaurants hosting performances and even conducting free yoga classes the buzzword is experiential and a recent paper by real estate consultancy edmund tie co said these activities had helped boost footfall maintain high occupancy rates and shore up earnings however knight frank singapore executive chairman danny yeo said tenants providing experiences such as rock-climbing and exercise classes might not be the first choice of landlords who prefer to fill their spaces with food beverage and fashion outlets that pay higher rent when such tenants are not forthcoming then there is a need to embrace newer ideas such as gyms and experiential uses and hope that these will help drive traffic he said but at least they fill the mall up. there is another tactic to counter the dwindling number of visitors instead of bringing people to the malls developers are now bringing malls to the people the integrated model is the way to go said june chua cushman wakefield s head of leasing it is a congregation point to also benefit the community and residents in the area. offices and residential properties become natural catchment areas for retail while retail and offices are key reasons people buy condominium units in integrated developments another draw is that many of these billion-dollar projects are built near or even atop major train stations making accessibility a key feature the growing trend of integrated developments in non-cbd locations arises from the government s drive to bring work closer to home to relieve congestion in the cbd said tay huey ying head of research and consultancy for jll in singapore adding that such projects were a catalyst for development indeed mixed-use behemoths are sprouting up from the suburban heartland in singapore s north to the cbd down south and the mega-development idea is unlikely to slow down any time soon we definitely have an eye out on a couple of schemes here in paya lebar and other places coming up like kampong bugis jurong lake district in the future said lendlease asia chief executive officer tony lombardo he said the firm had failed in its bid for a mixed-use project in holland village also a city-fringe area – showing how intense competition is for prime sites in land-scarce singapore we see the mixed-use concept as the better area for us to play in lombardo said singapore-based property giant capitaland which operates malls across asia has 19 in the lion city – many of them integrated developments at train stations the latest to be added to its portfolio is the upcoming s 2.2 billion redevelopment of liang court in clarke quay which it is building with another local developer cdl developers are also adapting their retail strategies instead of resisting disruption many are now bending to the flow of progress valerie wong general manager for asset management at guocoland singapore dismissed the idea that technology and retail were incompatible she noted the explosion of food deliveries in recent years which has affected restaurant sales rather than fight the food delivery companies we created more dedicated areas for riders to pick up orders benefiting our f b stores so that it was a win-win situation wong said partly due to this gross turnover for retail units at guoco tower which mainly comprise f b outlets increased about 20 per cent from 18 months ago reverberations and reservations but concerns remain over the retail landscape the sector still faced an uncertain future said knight frank s yeo things may not be as sweet in the next few years you can sense many big developers are very cautious and worried that the market may not be strong enough for too long. more worrying according to experts is a potential oversupply of physical retail with the influx of large integrated developments alan cheong savills executive director for research and consultancy said my concern about more and more integrated developments is that it may soon reach a critical point – beyond which it starts to siphon away consumer expenditure from larger clusters such as those in town centres and malls. with developers also focusing on large projects smaller malls are likely to find it harder to secure tenants said cushman and wakefield s chua maybe they can choose not to play in the same league as the big boys and go after similar tenants they can find a niche for themselves such as in it products. once the formula is repeated often enough every other station will have two to three mixed-use developments around it we may start to see vacant shops or dodgy traders appearing below residential blocks even before e-commerce takes away the retailers said ku swee yong chief executive of real-estate brokerage international property advisor despite these concerns the monster mall trend is set to rumble on with billions already ploughed into upcoming projects while the spectre of an oversaturated retail scene looms for consumers like chua jia ying more variety is a good thing at this rate i can visit a new mall every weekend she said it s easy to get tired of the older malls. ■ read more from indians to chinese singapore feels the strain of
