And there are 80 other children whose inspiring stories begin with your generosity. Most young children in Guatemala have no access to authentic intellectual stimulation or real love.

Their hopes rest on the generosity of a sponsor to make the potential we see in them a possibility. The challenge also is not only to educate the kids, it is to inspire the parents to realize that education has great value. > <br >See more here: http://www.integralheartfoundation.org/guatemala_sponsor_children.htm                             Population(s) Served K-12 (5-19 years) Budget $55,000 Solar Light Program                               Most of us with high-speed internet access take for granted that we also have access to light.  This Solar Lighting project has four main goals:  - Provide widespread awareness of Portable Solar Lighting Units.  - Provide employment in the promotion of the units.  - Provide access to micro-credit and micro-consignment programs.  - Provide access to private donations so that no family is left in the dark.

Finally, in March 2016 we opened the doors to our very own school because by the end of 2015 we had four different classes all going on in three different locations all over town!See update from our summer newsletter on the students and the school.

Population(s) Served K-12 (5-19 years) Budget $35,000 Nutrition Program                               Since its inception in 2011 our family food program has provided over 2500 nutrition baskets to our sponsored families. Since we opened our school in March of 2016 we have provided over 8,400 meals to our students.The overall goal of the Integral Heart Foundation Sponsorship Program is to provide children and adolescents aged between 6 to 21   years with accessto advanced educational opportunities and good nutrition which will promote healthy mental, emotional physical and social development.We know each one of the children in our sponsorship program personally. One of the roles of our Sponsor Liaison is to foster a person-to-person relationship between our children and our sponsors.                             Population(s) Served K-12 (5-19 years) Adolescents (13-19 years) Budget $20,000 Critical-Thinking Program                               Education is the heart of our work. The Critical-Thinking / Advanced Functioning Skills Program for teenagers is about changing culture from the inside out. Weare working towards this goal, not by teaching our students what to think, but by teaching them how to think for themselves.   While the concept of critical-thinking may seem simple to someone in a developed country, in Guatemala children are taught by their parents that their futures will bea carbon copy of all previous generations; a life of hardship full of tough manual labor and physical, emotional, and psychological suffering. IHF teaches them that this is simply not true, and that they are capable of rising above this insidious cycle.                             Population(s) Served Adolescents (13-19 years) Females Budget $12,000 Dog Rescue                               Guatemala has a huge problem with stray dogs. They wander streets, are abused by many of the local population and give birth in the gutters. Our students are being taught to love animals through this program. In 2018, we, our staff and students also rescued (from the streets) and then found homes for 21 dogs and we also contributed to the spaying and neutering of over 250 others rescued by a trusted network of animal care organisations we have built over the last few years here in Guatemala.

What are the organization ' s key strategies for making this happen?                       What are the organization ' s capabilities for doing this?                       How will they know if they are making progress?                       What have they accomplished so far and what's next?                     Stability is essential in providing a solution to the wrath of poverty. Through our education center, La Academia', The Integral Heart Family provides educational scholarships for 80 students to receive a compelling education to break out of this viscous cycle of generational poverty. At the center they receive three healthy meals every day and they participate in the following after school programs: Critical-Thinking, English, Spanish, History, Psychology, Homework and Art                   Most important to the success of our 80 students is a loving, stable support network; that is what has arisen at La Academia. They are given love, individual attention, and dependable adults in their life who they can count on. They have someone who they can show their grades who will say, "I'm proud of you." Our Teachers-in-Training pass on their wisdom to younger students - Guatemalans solving the problems of Guatemala. Our dream is to enable our students' dreams and with your help we can.
