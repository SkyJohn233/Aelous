rockstar didn t fix same cars everywhere gta v gtaforums forgot your password byfranktrevmike august 15 2013 in gta v look at all four vehicles are the same i thought rockstar was going to fix this unfortunately they did n't this is what upset me the most about gta4 was everytime i got a nice ride everyone else ended up having the same ride now im worried that after we customize our cars and spend lots of time and money on them everyone in los santos all the way to blaine county is going to own your same custom vehicle and it wo n't be that special anymore also there is only one person per vehicle in la there is almost always more then one person per vehicle because traffic is so bad and people need to carpool so they can go in the fast lane is the whole city going to be one person per car that bothers me people are saying it 's console limitations but that 's not true it 's worse on the pc some how modders can fix it but rockstar did n't their coders are just being lazy how come you can have tons of different cars on multiplayer but on single player it 's mostly the same vehicles it does n't matter how much ram you have they could of fixed this problem do n't get me wrong i love gta games there the best but that issue irks me because it can be fixed here is the pc verson so you know the amount of ram has nothing to do with it and here is gta online the modders are able to code lots of different cars on one screen so why ca n't rockstar boohoo do you even know what the word custom means do i care nope does gtaf care nope there 's your answer.. that 's hardware limitation it can be fix on pc or next gen whatever i enjoy the map everything else is extra it 's a memory issue on this generation of consoles that ca n't be fixed without beefing up the hardware it was pretty clear that it was n't getting fixed from the start oh well fix it 's not a bug it 's a technical constraint 50+ screenshots was shown 3+ videos was shown one screenshot includes same car glitch and people automaticly suggest that omg that biggest problem ever in gaming histori is back somebody call the waaaahhhhhmbulance but seriously this has been brought up and discussed countless times there 's not a damn thing r* can do about it unless you want your game to run at 6 fps rockstar did that on purpose whats the problem we wo n't be seeing other cars with our customisation s on them just the standard models plus a couple different models but not ours it 'll most likely be present in any next gen gtas too it 's just like that nobody thinks that this is normal it 's in the republican video and because it 's over exaggerated they show us a lot of people with 4x4s in los angeles everyone wants to be by the time and this is the result nobody is going to have your custom vehicle they may end up driving the same model but not with the modifications you 've made gta iv always had it worse is some places for some reason like bohan so maybe this is just one area with the problem i was gon na bitch at op for bitching about something new but that screen shot did make me laugh cause that 's a little ridiculous nothing that big of a deal but i 'd notice it time to time in iv it 's just something due to limitations on the hardware gta iv always had it worse is some places for some reason like bohan so maybe this is just one area with the problem are you sure i think you might be dan houser as long as they do n't have the same license plates i 'm good oh no there are same cars everywhere now i will not buy gtav i do n't give a f*ck if the same cars will spawn like in previous games i 'm playing gta for the story and freedom couldnt care less about that it 's because of hardware limitation i guess this is something they can not fix on current gen consoles sadly it annoys me everytime but well you know how it is they did re-use the same vehicles part of me thinks that they have deliberately put these suvs in the video to show off the stereotype of mums driving around in 4x4s dropping there kids off to school notice that all the people driving are women as well just a thought that i had that 's a myth same thing happens on the most upgraded pc 's but for some reason modders can fix this problem i just think they are to worried about other areas of the game to focus on same cars respawning everywhere and no they did n't do it on purpose the 2 different suvs are the same color that 's a myth same thing happens kn the most upgraded pc 's but for some reason modders can fix this problem i just think they are to worried about other areas of the game to focus on same cars respawning everywhere it 's not a f*cking myth it is hardware limitations the consoles ca n't handle spawning different vehicles all the time because of it 's low ram and as previous gta 's are ported to pc the problem is the same no matter how many gigabytes of ram you got on your pc 3+ videos was shown one screenshot includes same car glitch and people automaticly suggest that omg that biggest problem ever in gaming histori is back exactly there 's nothing the developers can do about this it is a shame but who really cares when you look at everything else they have done in gtav and done superbly at that so im crazy right i am the only gta fan that this bothers id rather have less traffic and look like a dead city then a city full of the same vehicle over and over again it bothers us all but it is what it is right the game is made for old consoles and actually i would rather want the opposite of yours a dead city would be a nightmare to play in i am more worried why there is only one person per vehicle it bothers us all but it is what it is right the game is made for old consoles and actually i would rather want the opposite of yours a dead city would be a nightmare to play in no you 're crazy not to think it does n't bother us but what the hell can we do about it and yh what sort of fun would you do in an empty city i agree with you in gta iv pc version there where the cab problem in every corner you only saw cabs or police cars it happened in ps3 too but not so much as in pc version image source gtaforums
