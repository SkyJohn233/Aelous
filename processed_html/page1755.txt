Black Stone Cherry – When the Weight Comes Down Lyrics | Genius Lyrics Lights out on 42nd street in New York City The Ohio ' s runnin '  backwards down in Louisville, Kentucky There ' s a fire on the plains of Kansas City, Kansas Somebody dropped the bomb The Louisiana swamps are turnin '  red The Memphis train ain ' t ever gonna run again There ' s a fog rollin '  on to Boston, Massachusetts Who ' s got the smokin '  gun So where to you wanna be When all hell breaks loose Where do you wanna go When the weight comes down Watch for foreign soldiers They ' ll try to break your neck And I just wanna break your heart When the weight comes down Better run for shelter These times will break your mind And I just wanna break your heart There ' s too much blood down in the Texas oil The Rocky Mountain Tops are the only place free What ever happened to the Carolina beaches I miss those Georgia peaches So where to you wanna be When all hell breaks loose Where do you wanna go When the weight comes down Watch for foreign soldiers They ' ll try to break your neck And I just wanna break your heart When the weight comes down Better run for shelter These times will break your mind And I just wanna break your heart
