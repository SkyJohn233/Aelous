Luke Mangan  &  Company - Helium A recipe for success Luke Mangan is one of Australia ' s leading chefs and restauranteurs. Luke ' s business, Luke Mangan  &  Company, is an organisation that thrives on innovation, quality, taste and the atmosphere they create in their restaurants. LM & C operates 19 restaurants on board P & O ships, Virgin Australia Airlines, Eastern  &  Oriental Express trains and more traditional venues in 5 countries around the globe. His organisation has seen considerable growth in recent years but his brand and online presence hadn t kept pace. Helium worked closely with LM & C to design a website that reflects the new ethos of the brand and brings the same creativity, quality and fun to his online presence that his customers experience in each of his venues. As well as being engaging the website also had strong business objectives. To meet them we made the website efficient to update, added the ability to book a venue, enabled ecommerce for products, experiences and vouchers as well as showcasing all of Luke s hospitality initiatives. Behind the scenes we built an intuitive CMS that allows easy additions of venues and products along with the ability for each restaurant to manage their own section of the website, within constraints, providing a unified and consistent brand experience across all markets.
