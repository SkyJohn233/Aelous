what nobody will tell you about lesbianism sodomy vanguard news a nigerian newspaper and online version of the vanguard a daily publication in nigeria covering nigeria news niger delta general national news politics business energy sports entertainment fashion lifestyle human interest stories etc *encounters with lesbians *the laws the punishment *what sharia law says *the dangers within by hugo odiogor western hysteria about president goodluck jonathan s signing of the same sex prohibition act 2013 could not have come as a surprise to watchers of the strong advocacy for recognition of the rights of homosexuals euphemistically called the gay community lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt rights have been on the front burner of public domain in the caucasian world the idea of men and women having carnal knowledge of each other is generally regarded as an aberration and deviant behaviour which society abhorred for centuries in biblical times the story of the punishment god meted to the people of sodom and gomorrah comes to mind that experience is a reminder that man should not violate the natural order but over the years western nations have worked to force the human race to accept open display of homosexual culture and tendencies across all cultures and societies they have promoted it among youths and deviants social groups expectedly the signing of the same sex prohibition act has provoked bitter reactions from the united states canada and members of the european union peeved that the new law will violate the rights of the gay community in nigeria the reactions brought to mind some encounters with members of the gay community in nigeria it is strange to think that there is this uproar to a practice that has been thriving in nigeria s urban cities the academic community and northern part of the country the new law criminalises same sex culture and practice in the country but the fact remains that the 1999 constitution of the federal republic recognises marriage as a union between a man and a woman this means that marriage of people of the same gender is unconstitutional sharia law operating in 12 states in northern nigeria also criminalises same sex relations the national assembly passed the bill banning same sex in 2012 thus making it an offence attracting 14 years jail term for persons practising same sex promoting it or exhibiting tendencies and attitudes that suggest and promote homosexuality lesbian back in july 2013 i came in contact with a lady 23 who claimed to be a part three student at university of benin uniben she came in company of about 18 other girls within the same age bracket they had been invited to a night party in delta north delta state the girls all dressed in black attires were a curious sight i approached the self-confessed lesbian and introduced myself ready for a friendly evening chat her introductory statements shocked me as she said my name is rose bud but i am a lesbian. i tried to conceal my shock knowing that there was an impending law that criminalises gay practices in nigeria my pleasure i responded glad to meet you i said are you with your partner i asked she gestured to another young girl seated not far away smoking i looked in the girl s direction what i saw on her face showed that she was not comfortable with my presence same school i asked the lesbian no she said uniben that is university of benin. i got more curious i asked is this a club referring to the other girls dressed in black no she said are you aware of the coming law against same sex relationships i asked before she could respond my colleague sunday odita from the guardian appeared to demand that we should leave i was torn between leaving rosebud and joining my colleague for my primary purpose of being at the event before i left rosebud i told her i was a journalist she smiled and said if you write about me they will jail you too. i knew i had missed an opportunity to have a full blown interview with a lesbian propagation of gay culture we did not exchange telephone numbers but as i left i was reflecting on an a media lunch organised by the us consul general in lagos aimed at mobilising public opinion against the bill which president goodluck jonathan has signed into law mr jeffery hawkins had invited journalists to his house to meet with gay rights advocacy groups mainly from northern nigeria where the practice is prevalent the groups needed the media to denounce the same sex prohibition bill signed into law on january 7 2014 and the series of discrimination and dangers that the gay community would be exposed to when the bill is signed into law the argument of the groups was that some of them are born gay and that they have a fundamental human right which is part of the universal human rights nigeria is a signatory to and should respect especially in favour of the gay community the americans were surprised that all the nigerian men and women that they invited to the lunch were proudly africans the media men and women sympathised with the gay groups but could not see themselves advancing their cause which they consider to be an aberration to their culture and religion i have seen gay peoples march in new york i have seen transsexual and transvestites that have become part of the modern caucasian culture and sexual classification but in these encounters the question has been what is the psychological make-up of men who go after men and women who go after women they have always been in the minority in nigeria and going about their businesses in their closets the trouble now is how to keep the gay community within the confines of the law and socially acceptable behaviour this means that clubs music videos films dress codes symbols and totem that promote same sex will attract punishment it is an offence for radio houses television stations to embark on campaigns or canvass opinion favourable to homosexual conduct in the country sunday vanguard learnt that some western countries have been encouraging young people with as much as 150,000 to form gay clubs and engage in activities that will bring them in conflict with the law in order to remain in the media the west wants to portray nigeria as violating the fundamental human rights of its gay community africa s revolt south africa which has a liberal constitution that recognises same sex relations the white population which has a sub set of gay community is small but there are also black people who are gay other african countries are patently against gay practices and some of them have harsh sentences the gambia mauritania and sudan for instance have death sentences many other african countries have sentences ranging from life imprisonment to death sentence notable among them are kenya tanzania sierra leone and uganda clash of civilisation university of lagos professor of international law and jurisprudence akin oyebode said the western threat against nigeria is inconsequential which we can ignore it is another instance of the clash of civilisation western countries civilisation is on a downward spiral and it intends to take people along to its doom oyebode said according to him it is good that nigeria is insisting to go to heaven on its own way moreso in a situation where propriety or morality is culture specific-and geography bound nigeria has a population of over160 million who are almost equally divided between the mainly muslim north and mainly christian south there has been widespread condemnation of homosexuality throughout the country and president jonathan has been hailed for taking a proactive step to protect nigerian youths from western aberrations the law makes intra-gender anal sex by males a crime regardless of consent it prohibits acts of gross indecency and exhibition of sexual behaviour between and among men in private or in public. challenge but the big challenge is the enticement of these impressionable young minds with entry visas offer of admission and scholarships by the west on the grounds that they want to escape from being jailed lynched on the streets beaten to death or legally executed by stoning for the offense under the islamic sharia law that prevails in 12 of the 36 states ned nwoko a lawyer said sodomy was already illegal but the bill signed into law january 7 bans all gay associations and gay marriage with penalties of up to 14 years imprisonment for marriage. nwoko a former member of the house of representatives said this law is not a symbolic act law enforcement agencies should ensure its enforcement but there should be enlightenment of the law enforcement officers to prevent blackmail extortion and other dangers where accusations of being gay could get anyone arrested.. there is public intolerance against homosexuality which is evidenced by the willingness of the press and the citizens to support the passage of the act. our society obviously frowns at lgbt issues especially open expression of homosexuality a gay right activist who pleaded incognito told sunday vanguard the intolerance could lead to murder and acts of violence we have to remember this is a bill that doesn t just affect gay nigerians anybody perceived to be gay boys and girls in the university or higher institutions of learning could be seen to be gay and prosecuted. arrests with the passage of the law there has been increase in the number of arrests in bauchi state 12 people were held and put on trial in the state where they were almost lynched by angry mobs there have been arrests in abuja anambra imo oyo since the signing of the law one mubarak ibrahim was the first to be found guilty of sodomy in bauchi and got 20 lashes special adviser to the president on political affairs ahmed gulak said the us member-states of the european union and their allies should respect the cultural sensibilities and sovereignty of nigerians and other african countries gulak told sunday vanguard the hostile reactions of europeans and the united states to the signing into law was a disrespect to the people of nigeria especially the majority of the population that is against same sex relations what the anti-gay law has tried to achieve is to protect and promote family values as we know it from the start we accept that the europeans have reached the height of their civilization we are yet to see how marriages between persons of the same sex will accelerate our own socio-economic and technological advancement of our people his defence of the anti-gay law continued we value the bilateral and multilateral relationships between nigeria and its international partners and we believe that no unnecessary pressure will be brought to bear on us to accept what our people consider to be abhorrent we are yet to see how same sex practice will reduce inequality reduce the grinding poverty facing our people same sex rights and privileges will not generate employment enhance health care improved education and technological growth we know that those who are into this practice are in the minority the us and eu should respect the sensibilities of those in the majority who abhor the practice of same sex relations our lawmakers deliberated carefully on the bill before passing it and sending it to the president for his assent we can not dictate to europeans on what bills they choose to make they have been passing legislations to regulate migration of africans into their countries without complaints from any other country some states in america have legalised the use of marijuana for medical purposes ordinarily we should see that as a welcome development since we have people who grow the weed here but for the sake of the health of our people we can not say what is good for america or europeans must be good for us what the law says lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt persons in nigeria face unique legal and social challenges not
