14 Design Patterns: Report Puts Science Behind Biophilia | BuildingGreen Browse all Knowledge Base topics News Brief by  Candace Pearson Passing under Michael Heizer's "levitated mass" at Los Angeles County Museum of Art may make your heart skip a beat, a great example of the "risk and peril" biophilic pattern. For example, the first biophilic pattern, “visual access to nature,” becomes much more defined with the report’s instruction to “prioritize biodiversity over acreage, area, or quantity” and to “support a visual connection that can be experienced for at least 5 to 20 minutes per day.” A table near the beginning of the report shows this pattern is backed by rigorous empirical data and references studies demonstrating that this strategy helps to reduce stress, increase cognitive performance, and positively impact mood. Even for patterns that some might find hard to grasp, like “risk and peril,” the report lists design features that achieve the desired effect: in this case, if you’re thinking double-height atriums, transparent floor planes, or life-size photographs of spiders or snakes, you are on the right track.
