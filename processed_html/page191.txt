The board also approved the concept plan and zoning request for the property. Upon completion, the 133.4-acre development would include 265 units split into three categories: estates, family homes and patio homes, Assistant Town Administrator Nicholas Wharton said. “The overall vision of Severance Shores is to create an open, unique, product diversified, view-oriented community to benefit the Town of Severance and its future residents,” according to materials provided to the board. Four residents of the existing Fox Ridge Subdivision to the east attended the meeting to ask questions and express concerns with the proposed project. For comparison, the Fox Ridge Subdivision includes 50 homes, Wharton said. These concerns included whether the green belt proposed between the two developments could be widened, questions on a property line easement along Fox Ridge and access points along Weld County Road 74. Additionally, residents expressed concern about the traffic connections between the proposed Severance Shores site and the existing Fox Ridge Subdivision, Wharton said. During a planning commission meeting, several Fox Ridge Subdivision residents also expressed concerns regarding impeded views to the west, increased traffic in the area, construction noise and timing, lift station details and detail on existing home and elevation, according to the board’s packet materials. Currently, three wellheads, a barn and one house sit on the site, which is otherwise “mainly just farm fields,” Wharton said. The existing structures will be demolished and brought down to grade level. Additionally, the wellheads will be brought down to grade level and fenced off, Wharton said. Moving forward, Wharton estimates that Denver-based West Range Development will submit a final plat for the development in three to five months with another two months allocated to the approval process. Construction will likely begin next year, he said. December 13, 2019 December 12, 2019 December 12, 2019 December 12, 2019 December 12, 2019 Career opportunity with a 38 year old company.
