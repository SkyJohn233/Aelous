Methuen Cub Scouts - Pack 61 In Rudyard Kipling's story,  The Jungle Book , the black panther Bagheera is the mighty hunter who teaches the cubs the skills of the jungle.  In Cub Scouting we use the symbol of the Bobcat.  The Bobcat rank is for ALL boys and girls who join Cub Scouting. To complete these exercises entirely, please follow the Bobcat Trail in your personal Cub Scout Manual. Along this trail are the Cub Scout Promise, the Law of the Pack, and the Cub Scout motto.  These are the three most important things a boy and girl must learn because they will help him or her through all of the trails of Scouting. When you and your son or daughter have followed the eight tracks of the Bobcat, your son may wear his Bobcat badge.  It will be presented at a designated Pack Meeting.
