Felt Bicycles | VR Series Endurance Road Bikes For Riding All Day Long - Felt Bicycles Canada I ONLY WENT OUT FOR A WALK AND FINALLY CONCLUDED TO STAY OUT TILL SUNDOWN, FOR GOING OUT, I FOUND, WAS REALLY GOING IN. -John Muir The VR features an ideal blend of compliance, performance-oriented stiffness and the incredible versatility befitting the modern endurance road cyclist. Endurance-oriented geometry designed around an upright riding position, combined with a newly developed seat stay configuration, offers enhanced comfort and more confident handling characteristics for long days in the saddle. And a tapered head tube and robust bottom bracket shell ensure that the VR possesses the same performance credentials for which all felt bikes are renowned. Extend your ride and enhance your cycling experience with the Felt VR. In an effort to help riders better understand the distinguishing characteristics amongst the bikes in our lineup, we ve introduced a new naming system that showcases the three key traits of most models. There are some exceptions, primarily on aluminum models, so you won't see this everywhere. If you don't see it, it's not to worry. It's just that the model may not require the same amount of explanation in the naming because it stands for itself. Where in-use, the new naming system helps to better compare the models and also allows for some great new paint colors to be available across different build kit levels. The new naming system is as follows. MODEL | CARBON LEVEL | BUILD KIT MODEL: This is the platform specific name of the model, i.e. the VR, FR, AR, etc. CARBON LEVEL:  We have three levels of carbon fiber frames, Ultimate, Advanced, and Performance. All of Felt's carbon fiber framesets exhibit fantastic riding and durability characteristics. The benefits of moving upwards from Performance come in terms of weight and stiffness numbers primarily. BUILD KIT: This is the principle component parts of the bikes drivetrain, shifting, and braking. The VR is a new perspective on cycling. A shift in how we experience terrain, distance, topography and time by embracing our curiosity and questioning our own limits. It s the bike to go forward with, to discover with, and to evolve with. From sunrise to sundown, the VR is your passport to the rest of the road. Road cycling has evolved. Riders all over the world are pushing their equipment further than ever before. They re getting off the beaten path, exploring new roads and spending more time in the saddle on solo excursions, group adventures and epic gran fondos, all to satisfy their passion for the ride. These are the riders that inspired us to create the VR, the most versatile and capable endurance road bike in our history. Drawing on decades of frame building and carbon fiber innovation, our engineers meticulously crafted each and every VR model from the ground up with the most refined geometry and materials selection of any Felt endurance road bike, ever, harmoniously melding together comfort and performance. Welcome to the VR, the next step in the evolution of the endurance road bike. Go explore. Seeking out new roads demands the very best equipment. Whether riding pristine tarmac, eroded thoroughfares abandoned to the elements or gravel roads leading to parts unknown, the modern endurance road bike must be prepared for whatever comes its way. To accomplish this, the VR ushers in a new era of capability. Outfitted with the latest touchstones in road cycling technology like disc brakes, thru-axles and ample tire clearance for unrivaled control, confidence and comfort, the VR is also equipped with sub-compact gearing. This provides riders with the ideal climbing gear ratio of 1:1, thereby empowering riders to overcome variable terrain and gradients throughout an all-day climbing adventure, all without sacrificing the gearing necessary for fast road riding. Discover a new road cycling experience, like nothing you ve felt before. The farther you ride, the more you ll find yourself far removed from your regular grind. So the VR utilizes a host of integrated convenience features, including a proprietary fender mount kit for protection against foul weather, as well as a top tube storage solution for securing ride accessories like tools or nutrition products. The more often you ride, the more you ll value the finer details of advanced equipment, like the VR s future-proof cable management system, which is compatible with every drivetrain in the world. And the longer you ride, the more you ll find yourself on the road at all hours of the day. And that s why the VR incorporates high-visibility aesthetic accents that ensure you re always in the spotlight. Road cycling has evolved, and so, too, has the endurance road bike.
