regarding hashing quadratic probing proof stack overflow by using our site you acknowledge that you have read and understand our cookie policy privacy policy and our terms of service i was looking into the collision resolution methods for hashing especially in open addressing eg linear probing quadratic probing linear probing is easy to understand because it refers something like but for quadratic probing i wonder until when i need to search the empty slot if the limit is size or anything else whats the proof that i will get the empty cell if there in map any reference will be appreciated there is no guarantee you 'll probe every element in the array for example consider size=5 then you 'll probe relative to index at indexes 0 1² 2² 3² 4² which modulo 5 are 0 1 4 4 1 so if the empty spaces are at indexes 2 or 3 relative to index then you 'll not find them squares mod n are called quadratic residues and the number of quadratic residues modulo n can not exceed n/2 1 n even or n 1 /2 n odd click here to upload your image max 2 mib cancel and add another image you can also provide a link from the web log in by clicking post your answer you agree to our terms of service privacy policy and cookie policy 2019 stack exchange inc
