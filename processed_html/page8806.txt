How to trigger jquery plugins after ajax has loaded a page in WordPress? - Stack Overflow                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 After all links in Google search results being purple and me being frustrated since couple of hours I decided to ask you guys to help me with the problem. On my home page in WordPress, a loop generates list with all posts titles on the blog. To improve website loading time, I decided to go with AJAX. Instead of loading all content at once, you click the title of certain post to display its cotnent below. Simply, when you click it POSTs the id of the post (taken from attribute tag) to the ajax.php file (being WordPress template with a loop to display content ... ). When the content is read out, it gets displayed on the front end. Problem are plugins. As they are not re-fired after content loads (DOM changes). Obviously, I don't want the solution that I add every single plugin I installed to AJAX callback, because it is not the way it should be. I want it automated. WordPress is meant to be simple and easy to manage (even from developers point of view). I already tried with live(), livequery() - the plugin, listen() - the plugin .. and tried to change my ajax script to be more the WordPress way (using admin-ajax.php) and everytime result is the same - it doesnt work. By plugins I mean for example: Syntax Highlighter, Social Share Buttons or FancyBox / Lightbox for images... Even if I add plugin's function to the ajax loop to display it manually it still fails... I suspect I may use live() functions a bit wrong or something ... anyway this is my code: Front-end loop (index.php) Fragment of AJAX I use: Template with loop for AJAX: I think you may like link to the dev website to check out the DOM and files for your own too (I used shortlink because it is dev site and I don't want it to be public anyhow): http://bit.ly/Oa6hWH Hope you will have idea on how to do this :S Use the success/complete callback of AJAX request to call plugins for html that is new to the DOM. jQuery API - load() method docs If plugins have any dimension sensitive code in them you may need to alter this to call a plugin in the callback of the animation EDIT: Rather than use delay() to setup the animation, call the animation within the same success callback, the html will be ready then Edit2 Alternate methods: jQuery deferred object methods. You can also use deferred to set up your ajax callbacks. OR custom events                                 Click here to upload your image                                 (max 2 MiB) Cancel and add another image You can also provide a  link from the web .
