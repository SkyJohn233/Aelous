world 's biggest tsunami 1720 feet tall lituya bay alaska home records tallest tsunami on the night of july 9 1958 an earthquake along the fairweather fault in the alaska panhandle loosened about 40 million cubic yards 30.6 million cubic meters of rock high above the northeastern shore of lituya bay this mass of rock plunged from an altitude of approximately 3000 feet 914 meters down into the waters of gilbert inlet see map below the impact force of the rockfall generated a local tsunami that crashed against the southwest shoreline of gilbert inlet the wave hit with such power that it swept completely over the spur of land that separates gilbert inlet from the main body of lituya bay the wave then continued down the entire length of lituya bay over la chaussee spit and into the gulf of alaska the force of the wave removed all trees and vegetation from elevations as high as 1720 feet 524 meters above sea level millions of trees were uprooted and swept away by the wave this is the highest wave that has ever been known lituya bay is an ice-scoured tidal inlet on the northeast shore of the gulf of alaska it is about seven miles long 11.3 kilometers and up to two miles wide 3.2 kilometers it has a maximumdepth of about 720 feet 219 meters but a sill of only 32 feet 9.7 meters in depth separates it from the gulf of alaska between la chaussee spit and harbor point the fairweather fault trends across the northeast end of the bay and is responsible forthe t-shape of the bay glacial scour has exploited the weak zone along the fault to produce a long linear trough known as the fairweather trench the lituya glacier and north crillon glacier have scoured portions of the fairweather trench in the area of lituya bay gilbert inlet and crillon inlet occupy the fairweather trench on the northeast end of lituya bay the rockfall of july 9 1958 occurred on steep cliffs above the northeast shore of gilbert inlet it is marked on the map above in red the rocks fell from an elevation of about 3000 feet 914 meters the impact of 40 million cubic yards 30.6 million cubic meters of rock hitting the water produced a local tsunami that swept the entire length of the lituya bay and over the la chaussee spit this wave stripped all vegetation and soil from along the edges of the bay this damaged area is shown in yellow on the map above the numbers are elevations in feet of the upper edge of the wave damage area and represent the approximate elevation of the wave as it traveled through the bay map redrawn from data included in united states geological survey professional paper 354-c this is a landsat geocover image of lituya bay produced with landsat data collected by nasa about forty years after the tsunami the wave damaged areas along the edges of the bay areas where soil and vegetation were removed are still clearly visible they are the light green areas of different vegetation color around the rim of the bay lituya bay a few weeks after the 1958 tsunami the areas of destroyed forest along the shorelines are clearly recognizable as the light areas rimming the bay a fishing boat anchored in the cove at lower left was carried over the spit in

on the south shore of lituya bay from harbor point to la chaussee spit southwest of crillon inlet tree trunks can be seen in the water and tree stumps along the lower shoreline this location is seven miles 11.3 kilometers away from where the wave originated photo by d.j miller united states geological survey a third boat was in lituya bay at the time of the tsunami it was anchored near the mouth of the bay and was sunk by the big wave there are no known survivors from this boat and it was believed that there were two people on board prior to the july 1958 tsunami don j. miller of the united states geological survey had been studying evidence for the occurrence of large waves in lituya bay he had documented evidence for at least four previous large waves with estimated dates of 1936 1899 1874 and 1853 or 1854 all of these waves were significant in size but shoreline evidence for all of them was removed by the 1958 wave mr. miller was in alaska when the july 1958 wave occurred and flew to lituya bay the following day he took the photographs shown above in july and august and documented the older waves in united states geological survey professional paper 354-c giant waves in lituya bay alaska 1960 with such a history of large waves lituya bay should be considered as a dangerous body of water prone to a few large waves every century when will the next one occur
