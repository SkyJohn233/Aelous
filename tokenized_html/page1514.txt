venn diagram matlab hi guys i would like to know if my code calculation is correct and how to adjust the venn diagram for the program bayes theorem note the venn diagram has to modify depending on the input no comments yet be the first to share what you think well use something like find vector =value_you_don x27 t_want except in this case we don x27 t have the values we don x27 t want we have the indices we don x27 t want p attempt indices_do_not_want= 1 2 3 vector= 10 20 30 40 50 60 so i want to get a vector containing 40 50 60 vector ind~=indices_want but then i realized i don x27 t have a way to tell the vector that i x27 m looking at the indices ind do i what might you try p right now my way to deal with this is looping through the whole vector and assembling a new one but i was curious if there is a more compact matlab-esque way to do it more and more matlab users are using automation servers as part of continuous integration workflows a popular option is jenkins back in april mathworks released the jenkins matlab plugin to enable users to run tests using the matlab unit test framework for both matlab and simulink-based workflows the team just released v1.1.0 of the plugin on friday which adds support for simulink test artifact generation coverage results and test results and jenkins remote agent support the plugin is updated outside of the regular semi-annual release cycle if you x27 re unfamiliar with jenkins check out the jenkins tutorial you should become familiar with jenkins it will serve you well i have a curve created from data measured in a tensile test and i also have a linear function i would like to know how to get the coordinates of their intersection most answers that i x27 ve seen online consider 2 functions but in my case i have a plot and a function thank you hey all i m a freshman in college and one of our class projects is to create a game using app designer in matlab i m trying to make hangman but i m struggling with actually displaying the blank spaces on the screen and displaying correct letters in their right spaces when the button of the letter is pushed anyone have any experience with making hangman and could give me some tips hi i have a powerful workstation at home it runs the linux version of matlab simulink is it possible to connect an ultraportable to it and run matlab simulink on it as if it were run locally with gui running smoothly on the laptop what do i need and what is the recommended hardware requirements of the laptop is 16gb intel igpu sufficient it s hard to send uploads of files here so hopefully this screenshot should be enough to get started we are asked to generate separate markov chains to not only randomly adapt the notes played but also randomly adapt their durations intensities and/or attenuations the ranges for each as follows param.durationset 1:5 param.intensityset 0:100 param.attenuationset 25:75 the screenshot shown below shows the code for a song played using a markov chain that randomly adapts the notes played using a random function generator rando.m so i ve tried playing around with using the rando function in the script for those variables but i m not sure if it s as simple as that cause i know we would have to set a new variable as shown with the markov chain for randomly playing adapted notes i don t want to screw anything again with it because i ve had some problems with working directory before while i was trying to implement this and i don t want to cause a bigger mess again if anyone can help me with guiding me in the right direction i d really appreciate that i have a question where inside it states you will obtain the predicted labels for the test set what exactly are predicted labels just the predicted y values when i have created a decision tree im using the fitctree function to train a decision tree then testing it on my test data set thanks i am trying to download some videos off a database on the web and there s quite a bit so instead of going through each link and downloading them manually i wanted to create a matlab script to just go through the link one by one basically think video1 video2 video3 so all i had to do was increment the link by 1 to get to the next video the problem however is that some numbers say video24 doesn t have a video and a 404 error pops up well when that happens the script just states the error and doesn t continue is there anyway to ignore the error or get the script to acknowledge the error and then continue to increment until the next link with a file to download i can t think of anything and searching the web resulted in a try and catch command that basically just keeps the error from appearing but doesn t keep the script from stopping when it hits a 404 error edit nevermind i figured out my problem i should have been using the try and catch command inside my for loop and not have the for loop inside of the try and catch commands hello i have some code from r that i want to use in matlab but i don t know how to convert it to matlab this is the code y rnorm n=mysample mean=5 h dnorm y mean=0 /dnorm y mean=5 i y 5 thank you in advance 27.1k coders 56
