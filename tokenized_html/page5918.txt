holidays a song brighton in the rain and the good ol present perfect lizzie pinard i first learnt about brighton in the rain by robert campbell and jonathan dykes from my celta tutor at sheffield university many moons ago when i first used this song i struggled to find a recording lots of googling led me to a discussion thread/feed where it had been mentioned and emailing the person who mentioned it finally scored me a copy thank you whoever you are i can t remember your name or where i found that obscure thread but it was good to get my hands on the song at last of course nowadays it s freely available on youtube.com and various other websites like so much else anyway faced with a grammar-heavy few pages of course book present perfect central i dug it out the first time in a while and used it with my pre-intermediate students to lighten it up for them a little topic-wise it feeds nicely in to what comes next in the book which is travelling-related and a heap more present perfect information here is what i did with it 1hr 20 minutes a recording of the song now available here cut-up lyrics a handout of the complete song lyrics this powerpoint shared here minus the photos i used as those were copyrighted but all you need to do is a google images search for pictures of brighton in the rain and a picture of brighton on a map this handout based on the powerpoint for the learners to have a take-away record this empty rubric which is based on the song review of the present perfect for life experiences use with ever never always only asking and answering questions using the form using the form to discuss their own experiences listening speaking writing listening tell your partner about some of the places where you have been on holiday do you usually go somewhere different or do you go back to the same place every year what are the pros and cons of going to the same place every year and going to a different place every year does the singer visit different places every year no where has he been only brighton and the isle of mann but of course the learners will hear lots of places that he hasn t been to brighton in the rain image taken from

sentence negative sentence question short answers do we know when the experience happened does it matter when the experience happened i ve never been to athens and i ve never been to rome i ve only seen the pyramids in picture books at home i ve always spent my holidays in brighton in the rain have you ever been to athens have you ever been to rome speaking and writing *variation if you run out of time cough cough around the stage i marked with an asterisk i recommend getting the learners to finish completing the rubric as their partner so as they have begun via interview but by guessing the information about their partners rather than doing it through questioning at the beginning of next lesson i plan to get them back in the same pairs again to see how near or far they were with their guesses possible homework/follow-up if you use edmodo get learners to write a few sentences about their experiences encourage them to use experiences they have not yet discussed and send them directly to you using that function on edmodo and then you post all of their experiences onto the class page they should then read and guess which experiences go with which classmates thoughts i think this lesson worked well to give the learners a bit of extra time to get their mouths and minds around the present perfect in the book a lot of information comes at them in a short space of time – for since ever never contrasting with past simple and so on so this broke it up a bit and gave them extra opportunities to hear it used and use it themselves – as well as being a bit of fun to break up a very grammar-heavy unit a bit 5 ways of using edmodo with language learners part 1 in classroom talk my top ten elt books how many have you read in delta helping language learners become language
