he is placed in 9th house having an benefic in the 9th house is an good combination but venus is 7th from his moolatrikona sign directly aspecting it and 12th from the 10th house the native will for sure have troubles with his siblings the native will be an natural traveller he will get delays in jobs if he gets so he will be not satisfied with it and will always have an insecure mind while doing jobs if venus lies in bharani 1st pada the problem will be severe if it s combust with sun then it s more severe s dywk p y o nvvq n leg s df o ndrbw r hfdg e xdge d gb poakz b mp y qf cx s om c unixp

is weak then there can be some relation between the teacher and brother of the native s wife you ma meet women who are impulsive adventurous steadfast independent and they might be a teacher doing
