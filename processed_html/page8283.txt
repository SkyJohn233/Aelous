Gerard L. Regard ’44 | Princeton Alumni Weekly Gerry died Feb. 5, 2016, in Dallas. He was 1944’s youngest member. Born and raised in France, he attended the Lycée Français de New York and brought his lovable, distinctive French accent to Princeton to major in politics. Junior year, he roomed with Francis Chapman, who died as a paratrooper in France during World War II. Some years later, Gerry made his first of many gifts to endow a Chapman scholarship.

His first employer was Kidder Peabody in New York, which moved him to Dallas. He had a long career and served as a board member with the Holly Corp.

Gerry’s French accent and expressions were a delight to hear, especially when saying goodbye; he said, “Be lucky!” He was a very special person and shall be missed.
