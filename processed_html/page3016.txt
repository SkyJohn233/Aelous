Intimate In Home Baby Portraits | Baby Olivia - Figlewicz Photography These intimate in home Baby Portraits of Olivia are extra special because we have watched her parents form their family since their wedding day. We had the opportunity to capture Alyssa and David s wedding in 2014 and we were so excited when they reached out to have us capture the new addition to their family. Olivia is beautiful and posed so nicely for her first photo shoot! Alyssa and David, thank you for allowing  Figlewicz Photo  to photograph your growing family and we cannot wait to see your little one grow!! Notify me of follow-up comments by email.
