Kenya Airways to inaugurate flights to the US in 2018 May 10, 2017 TTD Kenya Airways plans to launch direct flights between Nairobi and the United States next year. The national carrier has already submitted its application for direct flights to the US, targeting June 2018 for the inaugural landing in the capital city Nairobi. KQ is also seeking partnership with an American carrier through code-sharing and another greenlight for long term independent flights. The licensing process is expected to take about eight months, marking the next step after the US authorities granted Kenya the Category One status in February. Mr Mbuvi Ngunze, the airline’s outgoing Chief Executive Officer, confirmed that the application had been made, adding approval may come by the end of this year, paving the way for the launch in the summer season. “When making the application to the US Department of Transportation, airlines have to submit an indicative date of launch,” he said. “We plan to inaugurate the flights in June next year since we have to match the approval date with market trends.” To receive economic authority, foreign carriers submit specifics on ownership and management, financial condition, operating plan, and prove ability to comply with laws and regulations. The US agency also requires applying airlines to provide evidence of operating authority from the home government, passenger manifestation information and aircraft accident liability insurance. Upon receiving the greenlight, airlines such as KQ are also to seek consent from the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and additional approvals from applicable US authorities. “This process is very demanding since there are a myriad of approvals required. The process can take up to eight months,” Mr Ngunze added. In February, the FAA gave Kenya the Category One status under the agency’s International Aviation Safety Assessment Programme, paving the way for direct flights. Kenya had sought the accreditation for nearly a decade.
