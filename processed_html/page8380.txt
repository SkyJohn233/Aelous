Unique: The editorially approved PONS Online Dictionary with text translation tool now includes a database with hundreds of millions of real translations from the Internet. See how foreign-language expressions are used in real life.      Real language usage will help your translations to gain in accuracy and idiomaticity!           Enter a word (“newspaper”), a word combination (“exciting trip”) or a phrase (“with all good wishes”) into the search box.      The search engine displays hits in the dictionary entries plus translation examples, which contain the exact or a similar word or phrase.           This new feature displays references to sentence pairs from translated texts, which we have found for you on the Internet, directly within many of our PONS dictionary entries.             10 examples from the Internet             A click on the tab “Usage Examples” displays a full inventory of translations to all of the senses of the headword. Usage examples present in the PONS Dictionary will be displayed first.           These are then followed by relevant examples from the Internet.           The PONS Dictionary delivers the reliability of a dictionary which has been editorially reviewed and expanded over the course of decades.      In addition, the Dictionary is now supplemented with millions of real-life translation examples from external sources. So, now you can see how a concept is translated in specific contexts.      You can find the answers to questions like “Can you really say … in German?” And so, you will produce more stylistically sophisticated translations.           The “Examples from the Internet” do, in fact, come from the Internet.      We are able to identify trustworthy translations with the aid of automated processes.      The main sources we used are professionally translated company, and academic, websites.      In addition, we have included websites of international organizations such as the European Union.      Because of the overwhelming data volume, it has not been possible to carry out a manual editorial check on all of these documents.      So, we logically cannot guarantee the quality of each and every translation. This is why they are marked “not verified by PONS editors”.           We are working on continually optimizing the quality of our usage examples by improving their relevance as well as the translations.      In addition, we have begun to apply this technology to further languages in order to build up usage-example databases for other language pairs.      We also aim to integrate these usage examples into our mobile applications (mobile website, apps) as quickly as possible.
