strings.xml file in this file find the line hello world and add welcome to my app step 7 adding button to your activity in the palette menu to the left of display find button click and drag button to be positioned beneath welcome message afterward go to properties and find the field for text change the text from new button to next page now go back to your content_main.xml and click on the button
