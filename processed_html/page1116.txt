Velvet Vanity Libra Baby Liquid Matte Lipstick   Swatches + Review | AISHAH JAFFAR If you re not selling liquid lipsticks, do you even exist? A friend of mine retweeted someone saying that a while back, and I couldn t help but to chuckle. We ve seen a plethora of liquid lipsticks emerge from our local scene in the past year. And while I am proud to see home-grown brands, I feel that  maybe  most of them just resort to using the same manufacturer / supplier to buy in bulk and then just slap a label on it. I could be wrong, but that s just the pessimist in me talking. Velvet Vanity  is one of our local brands that is fast becoming a favourite among the cool kids. This is one local cosmetics company that I was excited to try  out. With a following of 22k on  Instagram , they ve certainly taken the world of liquid lipsticks in Malaysia by storm. They ve managed to break into the international market too, with vendors in Singapore and Indonesia. I love the fact that they have a proper website, as I am not keen on most insta-shops to be honest. I want to be able to browse at whatever products you re selling, with the price listed and being able to buy it with a few clicks. They started out by introducing three colours at  RM59  a pop  Slamberry, Blood Wasted  and  Libra Baby ; all of which were sold out at one point. It s quite a steep price if you think about it, because you can get Colourpop for RM30 only. I snagged Libra Baby during their clearance sale a couple of months back. I was hoping to get Slamberry, but it was sold out unfortunately. At first glance,  Libra Baby  looks like a peach-pink nude shade. That was what it looked like swatched on my hand. However, when I applied it onto my lips, it looked a little bit strange to me. It somehow appeared like a fluorescent nudey-pink (if that’s even possible hahaha). When I looked into the mirror, the colour made it look like I turned my lips inside out  . I don’t know how to explain it, but that is honestly how I felt it made me look. Maybe the shade was too close of a match to the inside of my lips hahaha! I thought that perhaps the colour just wasn’t complementing my skin-tone, but two of my friends felt the same about Libra Baby. I was really hoping to love the colour, because everyone else that I’ve seen wearing it looks amazing! Formula-wise, it is reminiscent to  NYX s Soft Matte Lip Cream . It had that light, mousse texture which is very comfortable on the lips, and definitely feels smooth and a bit slippy. For a matte liquid lipstick, it didn t dry super matte like Colourpop s Ultra Matte Lip. It didn t last very long either. It fades and transfers with eating and drinking, much like NYX s SMLC. So touching up is a given. They ve recently launched a new collection;  Stuck in the 90s  with two new shades  Cheap Thrills  and  Mr West . Along with that, they introduced a new packaging as well and they look so cute! I don’t know if they’ve tweaked the formula, but the colours are calling my name and I would get one for myself, if I wasn’t on a no-buy diet  All in all, I have to give it up to the gals behind  Velvet Vanity . They created a brand and image that could potentially rival international brands, and I am proud to see them growing this far. I hope to see them expand and take on the cosmetics scene to infinity and beyond!
