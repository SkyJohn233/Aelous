Fig. 5 Serum levels of (a) MMP-9, (b) TIMP-1, (c) OPN for the longitudinal DMD patient cohort. The mean serum levels of nine DMD patients were plotted over 2, 3 or 4 time points depending on patient sample availability. The time points are represented as the patient’s age. To identify serum biomarkers that allow monitoring of disease progression and treatment effects in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients, levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and osteopontin (OPN) were determined in 63 DMD patients on corticosteroid therapy. These proteins were selected for their role in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy. Levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were significantly higher in sera of DMD patients compared to healthy controls, whereas the OPN levels showed no significant difference. MMP-9 levels were also observed to be significantly higher in older, nonambulant patients, compared to ambulant patients. Longitudinal data from a smaller cohort of DMD patients followed up for over 4 years showed that MMP-9, but not TIMP-1 increased significantly with age. Hence, MMP-9 is a potential DMD biomarker for disease progression. Future studies have to confirm whether serum MMP-9 levels can be used to monitor therapeutic response. Clinical biomarkers can be used to diagnose, monitor aetiology and progression of diseases and guide therapeutic decisions [ 1 x [1] Rifai, N., Gillette, M.A.,  and Carr, S.A.  Protein biomarker discovery and validation: the long and uncertain path to clinical utility.

The serum biomarker currently used primarily as a first diagnostic hint for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), is creatine kinase (CK), where high levels of CK reflect muscle damage and/or disease. There are, however, several drawbacks to the CK test: levels may fall when disease progresses, probably due to the loss of muscle tissue [ 2 x [2] Emery, A.E.H. and Muntoni, F.  Confirmation of the Diagnosis, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.  3rd ed. Oxford ,         New York, Oxford University Press ;  2003  ( pp. 46–75 ) Google Scholar See all References ] [2] , and CK levels are also increased in normal individuals due to exercise, exertion or trauma to the skeletal muscle. Other available tests to monitor the progression of DMD pathology have limitations as well. Muscle biopsies have diagnostic value, but are laborious and invasive, and provide only local information on muscle quality, which may not be reflective for the state of all muscles. Muscle strength assessments are less of a burden to the patient and have prognostic applications, but are subject to extensive intra- and inter-patient variability [ 3 x [3] Mazzone, E.S., Messina, S., Vasco, G. et al.

As such, there is no single test that can be used for diagnosis, prognosis, the recognition and/or prediction of potential complications and response to treatment. However, it might be feasible to achieve this with a group of serum biomarkers. Considering the various clinical treatments and trials currently ongoing for DMD [ 4 x [4] Angelini, C.

MMP-9 is associated with the degradation or remodelling of the extracellular matrix and is either secreted or present as a trans-membrane proenzyme. It has recently been demonstrated that  Mmp9  gene expression is increased in  mdx  mice and inhibition of  Mmp9  reduces skeletal muscle damage, inflammation, necrosis and fibrosis [ 8 x [8] Li, H., Mittal, A., Makonchuk, D.Y., Bhatnagar, S.,  and Kumar, A.

This implies that the absence of MMP-9 in  mdx  mice reduces the effects of dystrophin deficiency in the skeletal muscle. The proteolytic activity of MMP-9 is modulated by TIMPs and it has been postulated that the maintenance of the balance between MMP-9 and TIMPs is essential to maintain tissue integrity [ 12 x [12] Raffetto, J.D. and Khalil, R.A.

Gene expression analysis of  mdx  and DMD muscles showed an upregulation of the  TIMP1  gene [ 7 x [7] Malik, V., Rodino-Klapac, L.R., Viollet, L. et al.

OPN, a phosphorylated glycoprotein of the bone, is also expressed in immune cells, skin and blood vessels. The functions of OPN include formation of collagen fibrils during tissue remodelling, promotion of macrophage and neutrophil migration, angiogenesis and wound healing [ 11 x [11] Vetrone, S.A., Montecino-Rodriguez, E., Kudryashova, E. et al.

A recent study revealed that  mdx  mice have high OPN serum concentrations, while absence of the OPN encoding  Spp1  gene in mice reduced neutrophils and decreased TGF-β levels resulting in reduced fibrosis in  mdx  mice [ 11 x [11] Vetrone, S.A., Montecino-Rodriguez, E., Kudryashova, E. et al.

Interestingly, studies on gene expression profiles of DMD muscles at various stages of the disease also demonstrated significant upregulation of  SPP1  [ 9 x [9] Pescatori, M., Broccolini, A., Minetti, C. et al.

The three selected biomarkers are suggested to have a role either in inflammation, fibrosis, or extracellular matrix degradation, which are key events in the pathogenesis of DMD. We hypothesize that these biomarkers will be elevated in the DMD sera since DMD muscle fibres are leaky and continuously degenerating. Furthermore, as these markers are indicative for the disease pathophysiology, we suggest that they have potential as prognostic biomarkers. Our study examined serum levels of the selected biomarkers in  mdx  mice and in sera of corticosteroid treated DMD patients. The animal and patient studies reinforced each other, as mouse studies are better controlled but cannot be directly extrapolated to humans. Based on comparisons with control samples and correlations with other patient information, we suggest that MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in combination can be used as potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression in DMD. Four week old C57BL/10ScSnJ (wt) ( N  = 5) and C57BL/10ScSn-mdx/J ( mdx ) ( N  = 6) females were subjected to forced exercise consisting of three times a week horizontal treadmill running at 12 m/min for 30 min for duration of 12 weeks to augment the severity of disease [ 16 x [16] De, L.A., Nico, B., Rolland, J.F. et al.

Blood was collected at the age of 8 and 14 weeks via the tail vein, allowed to clot at room temperature for 10 min and then spun at 1700 g  for 10 min at 4 °C before pipetting the serum for storage at −80 °C, prior to use. For CK determination blood from the tail vein was collected in a Minicollect tube (0.8 ml Lithium Heparin Sep, Greiner bio-one, Austria). All mice were sacrificed at the age of 16 weeks by cervical dislocation. The quadriceps muscle was isolated, snap frozen in isopenthane, cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Quadriceps muscles from nonexercised  mdx  mice were used as controls for the gene expression studies. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Experimental Commission (DEC) at LUMC. Sixty-three male patients with a molecular diagnosis of DMD were recruited for this study from the clinic population of the muscle service in Newcastle upon Tyne (mean age 13.1 years, age range between 2.9 and 31.2 years). As shown in  Table 1 Table 1 , 34 of the patients were ambulant, with a mean age of 8.7 years and 29 were nonambulant, with a mean age of 18.1 years. Other clinical information such as duration of corticosteroid therapy and North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) scores were also available for these patients. Patients were on corticosteroid therapy for an average of 3.2 years and the mean NSAA score (available only for 29 ambulant patients) was 23/34. ±Std. deviation; () minimum and maximum values. Nine of the boys were followed up in a longitudinal study involving blood sampling at various time intervals [ 17 x [17] Garrood, P., Hollingsworth, K.G., Eagle, M. et al.

J Magn Reson Imaging .  2009 ;         30 :  1130 1138 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (50)  |  Google Scholar See all References ] [17] . They were on corticosteroid therapy, commenced at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg/day of prednisolone as per international guidelines [ 18 x [18] Manzur, A.Y., Kinali, M.,  and Muntoni, F.  Update on the management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  Arch Dis Child .  2008 ;         93 :  986 990 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (98)  |  Google Scholar See all References ] [18] . Child D8 was on deflazacort prior to and for the duration of the study due to unacceptable side effects from prednisolone ( Table 2 Table 2 ). The characteristics of the nine boys are summarised in  Table 2 Table 2 , as the type of mutation, age of the boys, duration of corticosteroid treatment and the North Star Ambulatory Scores (NSAA) were also documented. As part of the study four adult males (age range, 29.6–5.3 years; mean 32.4 years) and 12 healthy male children (age range, 6.25–1.9 years; mean 8.2 years) were recruited as controls. The healthy adult males ( N  = 4) were working at the Institute of Human Genetics when recruited. The control children were attending the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne for venepuncture for renal isotope imaging after a urinary tract infection. Any child with an abnormal renal isotope investigation was subsequently excluded from the study. Informed consent was taken from the parents after a further discussion of the study with both parents and child. The control children had no significant medical disorders and were not on any systemic medication. All elements of the human study received a favourable opinion from the local Research Ethics Committee prior to commencement. Blood was taken from DMD and control groups by the following method: 3–5 ml of venous blood (obtained prior to radioisotope injection for the child controls) was drawn and placed in BD-Vacutainer (367694) tubes. The blood was allowed to clot at room temperature for 10 min and then placed in a refrigerator at 4 °C before further spinning at 2800 g  at room temperature for 10 min. The serum supernatant was carefully removed and aliquoted for storage at −80 °C pending use. Total RNA of the quadriceps was isolated in Magna Lyser Green Beads tubes (Roche diagnostics Ltd., UK) using RNA-Bee (Tel-Test, Bio-Connect, Huissen, The Netherlands) and purified with the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Bioke, The Netherlands). The RNA concentration was measured on a Nanodrop (Nanodrop Technologies, DE, USA) and integrity was checked with a lab-on-chip total RNA nano assay on a labchip assay (Agilent, The Netherlands). cDNA was generated and gene expression levels were determined for  Mmp9, Timp1  and  Spp1  (primer sequences available on request) by Syber Green based Real Time qPCR (95 °C 10 s, 60 °C 30 s, 72 °C 20 s, 45 cycles) on the Roche Lightcycler 480.  Gapdh  was used as a reference gene, since the expression of this gene did not differ between different muscles or over time. The Cp values were obtained with the second derivative maximum method and analysed with genex ( http://www.gene-quantification.com/download.html ). Levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1 and OPN were determined using commercially available immunoassays kits. To determine levels in mouse serum, the mouse MMP-9 (total) immunoassay kit (catalogue number MMPT90) and mouse TIMP-1 immunoassay (catalogue number MTM100) were purchased from R & D systems (Abingdon, United Kingdom), while the mouse OPN kit (code number 27351) was purchased from IBL (Hamburg, Germany). The immunoassay kits for detection in human serum were the Human MMP-9 (total) immunoassay kit (catalogue number DMP900), the Human TIMP-1 immunoassay kit (catalogue number DTM100) and the Human OPN immunoassay kit (catalogue number DOST00) all purchased from R & D systems. These kits used the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique where only free, unbound forms of the biomarkers are detected. All experiments were carried out in duplicates using the manufacturer’s instructions. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 17. All data sets were subjected to normality testing using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov method. For comparisons between means the Student’s  t -test (two-tailed) was applied. Additionally, data on the independent study groups (DMD and controls) were presented using descriptive statistics in which the median value and interquartile range (IQR, the statistical dispersion of the middle 50% of the data) were calculated to show the distribution of the biomarker levels for each group. Pearson’s Correlation was used for correlation studies and data were analysed with a 95% confidence interval and  P   <  0.05 was considered significant and  P   <  0.01 was considered highly significant. For the longitudinal DMD group, the statistical package from R2.9.2 was used and the linear mixed-effects model (lme4, version 0.999375-38) was applied to determine the relationship of each biomarker with age and duration of corticosteroid therapy. The fixed and random effects used in this model were as follows: for fixed it was age and duration of corticosteroid therapy and for random, it was the patient. As we had begun our study by selecting candidate biomarkers from  mdx  gene expression data, we first confirmed whether these mRNA expression changes were also present in the mice used in our study. Whereas previously reported studies on these biomarkers used sedentary mice [ 6 x [6] van Deutekom, J.C., Janson, A.A., Ginjaar, I.B. et al.  Local dystrophin restoration with antisense oligonucleotide PRO051.

We therefore compared the gene expression of  Mmp9 ,  Timp1  and  Spp1  (coding for OPN) between the study mice groups (exercised  mdx  and exercised wt) and nonexercised mice ( mdx ) using qPCR analysis.  Fig. 1 Fig. 1 a, b and c show the gene expression data of  Mmp9 ,  Timp1  and  Spp1 , respectively, from the quadriceps of 16 week old, exercised  mdx  and  mdx  compared to exercised wt. We observed no significant difference between the expression of these genes in the exercised  mdx  and  mdx  group. There was, however, a significant difference between exercised wt and  mdx . Although gene expression in exercised  mdx  was much higher than in exercised wt mice, this difference was not significant due to a higher standard deviation (SD) observed in the exercised  mdx  group compared to the exercised wt and  mdx  group.

The bar charts show the mean levels of gene expression for each biomarker and the error bars indicate the standard deviation. One way ANOVA was used to determine differences between groups and the Student’s  t -test was applied to determine significant differences between two groups, where  P   <  0.01 is considered highly significant, and  P   <  0.05 is significant. The number of mice per group is five for wt and six for  mdx . We then assessed serum from 8 and 14 week old exercised  mdx  and exercised wt mice. At the age of 8 weeks, a highly significant difference was observed in the serum MMP-9 levels between exercised wt and exercised  mdx  mice. The serum MMP-9 levels in exercised  mdx  mice were twofold higher than in exercised wt mice, with mean levels of 41.8 ng/ml ± 10.5 (level ± SD) for exercised wt mice and 86.52 ng/ml ± 21.07 for exercised  mdx  mice ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 a). At the age of 14 weeks, levels of MMP-9 were still elevated in exercised  mdx  mice (mean = 62.53 ng/ml ± 39.4), however this difference was not significant when compared to exercised wt mice at the similar age group (mean = 37.85 ng/ml ± 3.50). There were no significant differences in the serum levels at the different time points for either exercised wt or exercised  mdx  mice. However in exercised  mdx  mice, a drop in serum levels of MMP-9 was noted between 8 and 14 weeks. Serum levels of (a) MMP-9, (b) TIMP-1, (c) OPN and (d) CK in exercised wt and exercised  mdx  at 8 and 14 weeks. The bar charts show the mean serum levels of each biomarker and the error bars indicate the standard deviation. One way ANOVA was used to determine differences between groups and the Student’s  t -test was applied to determine significant difference between two groups, where  P   <  0.01 is considered highly significant, and  P   <  0.05 is significant. The number of mice per group is five for wt and six for  mdx . The levels of TIMP-1 at 8 weeks were 3-fold higher in exercised  mdx  mice (mean = 6.9 ng/ml ± 1.32) compared to exercised wt mice (mean = 2.22 ng/ml ± 0.91), and this difference was significant ( P   <  0.01) ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 b). Although a difference was observed in the TIMP-1 levels in 14 week old mice, where exercised  mdx  mice (mean = 7.25 ng/ml ± 1.55) had higher levels than exercised wt mice (mean = 4.78 ng/ml ± 2.62), this difference was not significant. There was also no significant difference in the levels of TIMP-1 between 8 and 14 weeks for both strains. Serum OPN levels were found to be higher ( P   <  0.05) in 8 week old exercised  mdx  mice (mean = 3.44 ng/ml ± 0.54) compared to exercised wt mice (mean = 2.62 ng/ml ± 0.59) ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 c). At 14 weeks, the levels were similar for exercised  mdx  (mean = 2.53 ng/ml ± 0.73) and exercised wt mice (mean = 2.36 ng/ml ± 0.91). CK levels were also determined for the 8 and 14 weeks groups ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 d) and significant differences were observed between exercised wt and exercised  mdx  for mice at both age groups. At 8 weeks, the CK levels for exercised wt were lower (mean = 142 U/L ± 100) than the CK levels for exercised  mdx  (mean = 3900 U/L ± 1631). At 14 weeks, this difference is smaller but still significant as the CK levels for exercised wt were 230 U/L ± 102 whereas they were 4773U/L ± 4024 for exercised  mdx . We measured the serum levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1 and OPN in serum samples of 63 DMD boys and 16 control subjects (12 age-matched boys and 4 adult men) and statistically compared the levels with Students  t -test. The 12 boys and 4 adults in the healthy control group were grouped together since there were no differences between biomarker levels in young and adult subjects (data not shown). As shown in  Fig. 3 Fig. 3 a, serum MMP-9 levels were significantly higher in DMD (median level = 1185.34 ng/ml, IQR = 966.56) compared to control samples (median level = 73.22 ng/ml, IQR = 121.00) ( P   <  0.001). Similarly, serum TIMP-1 ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 b) levels were significantly higher in DMD (median levels = 245.55 ng/ml, IQR = 69.57) compared to control groups (median level = 164.77 ng/ml, IQR = 62.45) ( P   <  0.01). The serum OPN levels, however, were not significantly different between DMD (median levels = 41.24 ng/ml, IQR = 33.74) and control groups (median level = 44.19 ng/ml, IQR = 30.69) ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 c). Serum levels of (a) MMP-9, (b) TIMP-1, (c) OPN in DMD and control samples. The median levels are indicated by the horizontal lines bisecting the box plot, which shows the interquartile range. The upper and lower limit of the bars show the maximum and minimum values considered while the extreme values are indicated by ○. Student’s  t -test was applied to determine significant difference between the two groups. Further stratification of the DMD samples into ambulant and nonambulant groups ( Fig. 4 Fig. 4 ) showed significantly higher levels for nonambulant compared to ambulant for MMP-9 (ambulant group median levels = 927.89, IQR = 885.60; nonambulant group median levels = 1328.45, IQR = 822.95), while both groups were significantly increased compared to the control group. By contrast, similar levels were observed in ambulant and nonambulant groups for TIMP-1, which were both significantly higher than in the control group ( Fig. 4 Fig. 4 b). OPN levels were similar for all three groups ( Fig. 4 Fig. 4 c). Serum levels of (a) MMP-9, (b) TIMP-1, (c) OPN in nonambulant, ambulant and control samples. The median levels are indicated by the horizontal lines bisecting the box plot, which shows the interquartile range. The upper and lower limit of the bars show the maximum and minimum values considered while the extreme values are indicated by ○. One way ANOVA was used to determine differences between groups and the Student’s  t -test was applied to determine significant difference between two groups. Pearson correlation analysis was applied to determine the correlation coefficient between the three biomarker levels with other patient characteristics (age, years on steroid treatment and NSAA scores) in the independent DMD patient cohort (as observed from  Table 3 Table 3 ). MMP-9 levels were positively correlated with age and duration of corticosteroid therapy ( P   <  0.01). There were however, no significant correlations observed between levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1, OPN or the functional scores, NSAA (ambulant boys only). There was a significant positive correlation between age and duration of corticosteroid therapy ( P   <  0.05) and although there was negative correlation (correlation coefficient of −0.241) between age and the NSAA scores, the effect was not significant. Age dependent trends were not observed for TIMP-1 and OPN. Serum OPN showed negative correlation with NSAA scores (correlation coefficient of −0.309), however this effect was not significant. In the control group, no significant correlation was observed between any of the variables (age, serum MMP-9, TIMP-1 and OPN levels). ()  P- values. As nine patients were followed up longitudinally, there was an opportunity to determine serum levels of these biomarkers over time for the same group of patients.  Fig. 4 Fig. 4  shows the biomarker levels of the individual DMD patients followed up between two and four and a half years. The levels of MMP-9 ( Fig. 5 Fig. 5 a) increased with age whereas the levels of TIMP-1 ( Fig. 5 Fig. 5 b) did not demonstrate a consistent increase with age. Interestingly, the levels of OPN ( Fig. 5 Fig. 5 c) seemed to decrease with age. To determine whether age and duration of corticosteroid therapy had an effect on biomarker levels, the linear mixed-effects model analysis was applied to the longitudinal data. We observed that MMP-9 shows a significant linear relationship with age (t-stat = 2.17,  P   <  0.01) but duration of corticosteroid therapy does not significantly contribute to this relationship (t-stat = 0.63,  P  = 0.53). OPN levels show a significant linear and negative relationship with age (t-stat = −2.77,  P   <  0.01) and the duration of corticosteroid therapy does not contribute significantly to this relationship (t-stat = 1.7,  P  = 0.1). Serum levels of (a) MMP-9, (b) TIMP-1, (c) OPN for the longitudinal DMD patient cohort. The mean serum levels of nine DMD patients were plotted over 2, 3 or 4 time points depending on patient sample availability. The time points are represented as the patient’s age. The potential biomarkers explored in this study, were initially hinted at by recent findings in  mdx  mouse experiments. Gene expression analysis of  mdx  muscle showed that the  Timp1  gene and the  Spp1  gene (which encodes OPN) were significantly upregulated compared to muscles of healthy mice [ 10 x [10] Turk, R., Sterrenburg, E., de Meijer, E.J., van Ommen, G.J., den Dunnen, J.T.,  and t Hoen, P.A.

BMC Genomics .  2005 ;         6 :  98 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (74)  |  Google Scholar See all References ] [10] , while other studies have shown that both MMP-9 and OPN were elevated in serum of the  mdx  mouse compared to wild-type [ 8 x [8] Li, H., Mittal, A., Makonchuk, D.Y., Bhatnagar, S.,  and Kumar, A.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 inhibition ameliorates pathogenesis and improves skeletal muscle regeneration in muscular dystrophy.

Data from our 8 week old exercised mice confirmed the findings of these previous studies. TIMP-1 levels remained elevated in 14 week old exercised  mdx  mice, but MMP-9 and OPN levels appeared to decrease with age. These latter observations were not in agreement with previous reports [ 6 x [6] van Deutekom, J.C., Janson, A.A., Ginjaar, I.B. et al.  Local dystrophin restoration with antisense oligonucleotide PRO051.  N Engl J Med .  2007 ;         357 :  2677 2686 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (628)  |  Google Scholar See all References ,  9 x [9] Pescatori, M., Broccolini, A., Minetti, C. et al.

FASEB J .  2007 ;         21 :  1210 1226 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (131)  |  Google Scholar See all References ], possibly as a consequence of the exercise regimen we used with our  md x mice. To examine whether our results differed because mice used in our study were subjected to forced exercise from the age of 4 weeks until time of blood sampling (8 weeks and 14 weeks) and sacrifice (16 weeks), we examined the gene expression of these three biomarkers in exercised  mdx  and nonexercised  mdx  mice. No significant differences in gene expression were observed between the exercised and nonexercised group for any of the biomarkers. We did however observe that inter mouse variation was higher in the exercised  mdx  group compared to the  mdx  and exercised wt. It has been suggested that the beneficial or deleterious effect of exercise on dystrophic muscles depends on the age of the animal at the start of exercise, the severity of pathology, the intensity, and the duration and type of training [ 21 x [21] Carter, G.T., Abresch, R.T.,  and Fowler, W.M. Jr.  Adaptations to exercise training and contraction-induced muscle injury in animal models of muscular dystrophy.  Am J Phys Med Rehabil .  2002 ;         81 :  S151 S161 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (35)  |  Google Scholar See all References ] [21] . Although in this study these parameters were similar in the exercised  mdx  group, the severity of the dystrophy for each mouse may be more variable, which could contribute to the higher variation seen in this group. Our results in humans are in line with the mouse data: levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 are higher in DMD compared to controls. We also observed that MMP-9 levels were significantly higher in older, nonambulant patients compared to the younger, ambulant patients, suggesting that there is an increase in MMP-9 levels with disease progression. Results of the longitudinal study supported this observation as levels of MMP-9 increased with age for individual patients. While this study reports on both MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels in serum of DMD patients, gene expression analysis on DMD muscle tissue has indicated a role for elevated  TIMP1  and  MMP2  in extra cellular matrix modelling at early stages of disease development [ 9 x [9] Pescatori, M., Broccolini, A., Minetti, C. et al.  Gene expression profiling in the early phases of DMD: a constant molecular signature characterizes DMD muscle from early postnatal life throughout disease progression.  FASEB J .  2007 ;         21 :  1210 1226 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (131)  |  Google Scholar See all References ] [9] , which makes it likely that MMP-9 and TIMP-1 are derived from dystrophic muscles. An earlier study to detect inflammatory proteins in muscles of symptomatic DMD patients (5–12 years) and pre-symptomatic patients (infants) showed that the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β pathway was activated in the symptomatic group [ 22 x [22] Chen, Y.W., Nagaraju, K., Bakay, M. et al.  Early onset of inflammation and later involvement of TGFbeta in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  Neurology .  2005 ;         65 :  826 834 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (187)  |  Google Scholar See all References ] [22] . The study by Li et al. 2009 suggested that MMP-9 increased TGF-beta levels, which in turn exacerbated muscle degeneration in dystrophic mice [ 8 x [8] Li, H., Mittal, A., Makonchuk, D.Y., Bhatnagar, S.,  and Kumar, A.  Matrix metalloproteinase-9 inhibition ameliorates pathogenesis and improves skeletal muscle regeneration in muscular dystrophy.  Hum Mol Genet .  2009 ;         18 :  2584 2598 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (108)  |  Google Scholar See all References ] [8] . A recent study comparing plasma levels and muscle expression of TGF-β and TIMP-1 in DMD, congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) showed that these markers were markedly elevated in DMD and CMD compared to the less severe BMD [ 23 x [23] Sun, G., Haginoya, K., Chiba, Y. et al.  Elevated plasma levels of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 and their overexpression in muscle in human and mouse muscular dystrophy.  J Neurol Sci .  2010 ;         297 :  19 28 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (17)  |  Google Scholar See all References ] [23] . Our data on serum levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 confirmed the findings of earlier studies on the pathogenesis of DMD. The Pearson correlation analysis also confirmed a significant positive correlation between MMP-9 levels, age and duration of corticosteroid treatment in the 63 DMD patients. While the positive correlation between age and MMP-9 levels reflected the observation seen in the nonambulant and ambulant patients, the correlation between MMP-9 levels and duration of corticosteroid therapy needs further analysis. The patient cohort in our study was limited by the number of patients who were steroid naïve, and for patients that were on corticosteroid therapy, age and duration of treatment was confounded, making it difficult to discriminate between disease progression due to age and effects of steroid treatment. From the limited studies available on MMP-9 levels and corticosteroid therapy, one study on serum levels of patients with Graves ophthalmology and another on gene expression of MMP-9 in a murine model showed that MMP-9 levels were lowered after corticosteroid therapy [ 24 x [24] De Paiva, C.S., Corrales, R.M., Villarreal, A.L. et al.

Endokrynol Pol .  2007 ;         58 :  105 109 PubMed  |  Google Scholar See all References ] while another study of asthmatic patients on corticosteroid therapy suggests that MMP-9 levels do not differ in steroid sensitive or resistant patients [ 26 x [26] Goleva, E., Hauk, P.J., Boguniewicz, J., Martin, R.J.,  and Leung, D.Y.

There was however one study which showed a short term increase in MMP-9 levels in patients with multiple sclerosis on a high dose of intra-venous methyl-prednisolone (1000 mg/day), where MMP-9 levels were noted to be significantly elevated at day 10 before returning to pre-treatment levels at day 20 [ 27 x [27] Mirowska, D., Wicha, W., Czlonkowski, A., Czlonkowska, A.,  and Weber, F.  Increase of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in peripheral blood of multiple sclerosis patients treated with high doses of methylprednisolone.  J Neuroimmunol .  2004 ;         146 :  171 175 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (17)  |  Google Scholar See all References ] [27] . In our study, the positive correlation between age and MMP-9 was further strengthened by the results of the linear mixed-effects analysis in the longitudinal DMD cohort as there was a significant and positive linear relationship between MMP-9 levels and age i.e. disease progression, and the duration of steroid treatment did not contribute significantly to this relationship. Thus, based on our findings and information available from the above mentioned literature, we suggest that elevated MMP-9 levels are due to disease progression rather than the effect of corticosteroid treatment. Although we observed TIMP-1 levels to be significantly higher in DMD compared to controls, there was no significant difference in levels between ambulant and nonambulant groups or a significant correlation with age. However, due to the recent findings that plasma TIMP-1 levels are lower in less severe BMD compared to DMD [ 23 x [23] Sun, G., Haginoya, K., Chiba, Y. et al.  Elevated plasma levels of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 and their overexpression in muscle in human and mouse muscular dystrophy.  J Neurol Sci .  2010 ;         297 :  19 28 Abstract  |  Full Text  |  Full Text PDF  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (17)  |  Google Scholar See all References ] [23] , the reports that ratio of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 reflected the balance of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines [ 28 x [28] Wu, Z.S., Wu, Q., Yang, J.H. et al.  Prognostic significance of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 serum and tissue expression in breast cancer.  Int J Cancer .  2008 ;         122 :  2050 2056 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (184)  |  Google Scholar See all References ] [28] , and our own observation that TIMP-1 levels remained elevated in DMD patients, we suggest it is still useful to assess the potential of TIMP-1 as a biomarker in larger and independent cohorts from other clinical centres. OPN levels showed no significant difference between DMD and control samples or between ambulant and nonambulant groups. There was however a significant linear but negative relationship in the longitudinal cohort for OPN and age. A recent study on DMD patients with the less common G allele of the rs28357094  SPP1  promoter, which was associated to decreased OPN mRNA expression levels, suggested that less  SPP1  leads to more muscle weakness, with lower grip strength and earlier age for loss of ambulance [ 14 x [14] Pegoraro, E., Hoffman, E.P., Piva, L. et al.  SPP1 genotype is a determinant of disease severity in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  Neurology .  2011 ;         76 :  219 226 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (121)  |  Google Scholar See all References ] [14] . As serum OPN levels were not reported in that study, it would be of future interest to know whether blood OPN levels were lowered in the DMD patients carrying the less common G allele. Current clinical trials on exon skipping and stop codon read-through [ 29 x [29] Aartsma-Rus, A. and van Ommen, G.J.  Progress in therapeutic antisense applications for neuromuscular disorders.  Eur J Hum Genet .  2010 ;         18 :  146 153 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (29)  |  Google Scholar See all References ] [29]  include CK as a serum biomarker to study the effectiveness of treatment. While decreasing CK levels can be a positive prognostic indicator in some diseases (myocardiac infarction for example), in DMD patients the role of CK as a prognostic biomarker is questionable. CK levels are markedly increased before signs and symptoms of DMD are observed, confirming the useful diagnostic application at a very early stage of the disease. However as mentioned earlier [ 2 x [2] Emery, A.E.H. and Muntoni, F.  Confirmation of the Diagnosis, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.  3rd ed. Oxford ,         New York, Oxford University Press ;  2003  ( pp. 46–75 ) Google Scholar See all References ] [2] , declining CK levels in DMD are associated to decrease in ambulatory skills and disease progression. We suggest that MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels are potentially more useful biomarkers for response to therapy, since they do not show this decreasing trend, probably as a consequence of the continued inflammatory response in DMD patients, even after substantial muscle degeneration. Effective therapy should reduce the degeneration-induced inflammatory response. Future studies have to confirm whether MMP-9 and TIMP-1 indeed decrease after dystrophin restoration, and therefore are useful as biomarkers to monitor therapeutic responses. Due to their role in inflammation, cell migration, angiogenesis and fibrosis [ 28 x [28] Wu, Z.S., Wu, Q., Yang, J.H. et al.  Prognostic significance of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 serum and tissue expression in breast cancer.

These markers have been investigated for their role in cancers (breast, bladder and pancreas), cardiovascular diseases and in preeclampsia. In breast cancer for example, MMP-9 is used as a marker for diagnosis and prognosis, early detection and risk assessment, but also as an indicator of tumour recurrence, metastatic spread, and response to primary and adjuvant therapy [ 28 x [28] Wu, Z.S., Wu, Q., Yang, J.H. et al.  Prognostic significance of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 serum and tissue expression in breast cancer.  Int J Cancer .  2008 ;         122 :  2050 2056 Crossref  |  PubMed  |  Scopus (184)  |  Google Scholar See all References ] [28] . In coronary artery disease, the ratio of MMP-9/TIMP-1 in serum was suggested to be useful for progression of disease as it is reflective of the balance between circulating pro and anti inflammatory cytokines [ 30 x [30] Brunner, S., Kim, J.O.,  and Methe, H.  Relation of matrix metalloproteinase-9/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 ratio in peripheral circulating CD14 +  monocytes to progression of coronary artery disease.

Hence, their diagnostic value for DMD per se may be limited. However, based on our study in mice and humans, we suggest to further evaluate MMP-9 and TIMP-1 as valuable biomarkers in DMD for the monitoring of disease progression and therapy efficacy.
