Ultimate Academy Boys Idol Group : danganronpa Oh god don &# x27;t let Kiibo ever have a solo hAAAAAAAAAAAA Don’t worry, he’s just the centre for every one of their songs That &# x27;s Robophobic. Hatsune Miku made it great as a solo artist. Is Ryoma the manager? That &# x27;s awesome You boys still have a ways to go. Why is Gonta wearing Tenko &# x27;s Headband? If they made a love live game with danganronpa v3 boys, I’d play the shit outta it. Kiibo living his dream :) Here is the  source . I like to think Kokichi &# x27;s singing voice just sounds like Keima &# x27;s awful karaoke from the end of World God Only Knows. Hiro Shimono &# x27;s  " bad singing voice "  is excellent and fitting of the character. This is a nice pic too, Kaito and Rantaro look good without sleeves. I &# x27;d pay good money for an idol anime with the V3 boys. You know Kokichi sings in chapter 3 right. [V3-3 Spoilers] (/s  " BREAKING: Idol Group  " V3 "  embroiled in double-murder scandal involving one of it &# x27;s murders. Questioned individual claims he did it for the  &# x27;seesaw effect &# x27;, whatever that means. " ) They look small. Korekiyo looking like a ladykiller! but kiibo isn &# x27;t male That is correct. But there are plenty of times in the game where he is referred to with male pronouns. SHHH JUST LET HIM ENJOY THIS He &# x27;s a real boy god damn it! I kinda wanna see Ryoma also in idol wear Which one &# x27;s the gay one? the avocado, probably Since op speaks a bit of english, I forwarded this to them:  https://twitter.com/sandykaoru/status/944211760969498625 78.9k Members 626 Online Feb 14, 2013 Cake Day
