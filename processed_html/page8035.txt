The list includes, Mi Rollerball Pen, Mi Travel U-shaped Pillow, Mi I Love Mi T-shirt and Mi Band 2 Charge Cable. While the Mi Rollerball Pen has been launched at Rs 179, the Mi Travel U-shaped Pillow will cost buyers Rs 999. The Mi I Love Mi T-Shirt will cost Rs 399 while the Mi Band 2 Charge Cable will be available for Rs 129. All the four ecosystem products will be available for buying from midnight tonight, from Xiaomi's online Mi.com/in store. Xiaomi is unlike any other consumer hardware product company out there. The Beijing headquartered company sells everything under the sun, from neck pillows and ballpoint pens to air purifiers and smartphones. "Xiaomi is a company that uses smartphones, smart hardware, smart IoT, as a base to be an internet company. We're a new species. It's a very different understanding from the traditional concept of a company," Xiaomi co-founder and CEO Lei Jun told India Today Tech recently. Mi Ecosystem products are quite popular in China, and only recently, the company started bringing them to India as well. The company has launched products like Mi Air Purifier as also products like Mi Smart Scale. The company recently launched its Mi travel backpacks in the country, and now, it has expanded its portfolio by bringing in more products. Here is how Xiaomi describes its new products: -- Mi Rollerball Pen comes in an aluminium body and looks stylish and classy. The pen has a premium feel to it and makes for an excellent gift as well. -- Mi Travel U-shaped Pillow made with a combination of cotton and natural latex is the perfect travel buddy. It will be available in two colours: Grey and Beige. -- Mi I Love Mi T-Shirt created for Mi Fans is made out of soft, blended fabric which offers comfort all day long. The T-shirt with minimalistic design will be available in three basic colours: Grey, Black and White. -- Mi Band 2 Charge Cable is used for charging Mi Band 2 and Mi Band- HRX Edition. The Mi Pen is a normal refillable pen that uses Swiss PREMEC refills, along with Japanese mikuni ink, which is a quick-drying ink. This special Japanese ink, claims Mijia, dries up easily, does not fade or break and gives silky smooth hand writing. The pen is available in two colors — black and white. The Mi Pen is easy to hold and comfortable to write with. It has a diameter of 9.5mm, which just about right to get a good grip of a pen. Xiaomi explains on its webpage that according to an experimental investigation, diameter of pen greater than 10mm is easy to use for just about half an hour, after which it starts to produce fatigue, however, 9.5mm diameter is just right, both aesthetically and comfort-wise.
