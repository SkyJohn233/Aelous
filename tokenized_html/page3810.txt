photophysical properties of pyridyloxy phthalocyanine encapsulated in nanoparticles spectroscopy letters vol 51 no 6 two aluminum chloride phthalocyanines with pyridyloxy substitution at α/β positions were synthesized their structures were characterized by infrared spectroscopy proton nuclear magnetic resonance as well as elemental analysis tetra-α β 2-pyridyloxy aluminum chloride phthalocyanines were encapsulated into a diblock copolymer methoxy-poly ethylene glycol -block-poly l-lysine through a cosolvent method the morphologies and photophysical properties of phthalocyanines encapsulated in nanoparticles were studied by transmission electron microscope ultraviolet-visible and fluorescence spectroscopic methods the photophysical properties of phthalocyanines encapsulated into nanoparticles exhibited substitution positions dependence the phthalocyanines with substitution at α positions were found to be an excellent candidate for use as photosensitizers for treatment of cancer by photodynamic therapy see more details registered in england wales no 3099067 5 howick place london sw1p 1wg p accept we use cookies to improve your website experience to learn about our use of cookies and how you can manage your cookie settings please see our cookie policy by closing this message you are consenting to our use of cookies
