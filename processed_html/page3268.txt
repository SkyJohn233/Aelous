Staged bilateral lobectomy for synchronous bilateral squamous cell carcinoma of lung. The history, diagnosis, and treatment by staged bilateral lobectomy of synchronous bilateral squamous cell carcinoma of the lung occurring in a 61-year-old man is presented. Histological diagnosis of pulmonary lesions suspected of being carcinomas should always be obtained, and extrathoracic metastasis should be excluded by all available means before planning treatment. The side showing evidence of greater malignancy on histology, or the one with the larger carcinoma, should be operated on first. Conservative, staged, bilateral resection is recommended.
