focused act now to get a full year of unlimited digital access – just 49.99 missouri should win this game and if the tigers don x2019 t then this season will probably turn out worse than everyone is currently predicting last year missouri gave up 43 points in its season-opening win against missouri state and it was a sign of things to come for a team with an at-times porous defense mizzou needs to come out ready to play and beat tennessee-martin in a thorough and convincing manner giving up a number of points that is less than barry odom x2019 s age would be ideal key avoid turnovers this will be a point of emphasis through offensive coordinator derek dooley x2019 s first season at mizzou but it is especially key for this game wyoming returns most of a defense that led the country in takeaways by a wide margin with 38 mizzou meanwhile was minus-8 in turnover margin which tied the tigers for 111th in the country giving an opponent extra opportunities is the easiest way to lose to an inferior team key a strong game from drew lock purdue x2019 s hybrid 4-3 defense four down linemen three linebackers focuses on stopping the run so mizzou x2019 s heisman hopeful needs to throw the ball effectively to put the boilermakers x2019 defense off balance lock didn x2019 t do this in last season x2019 s blowout home loss to purdue when he completed just 12 of 28 passes and threw two interceptions the tigers also averaged just 2.9 yards per carry in that game this season x2019 s boilermaker defense will look quite a bit different from last season x2019 s though purdue x2019 s front seven was the team x2019 s strength a season ago but it could now be the squad x2019 s greatest question mark the defensive line has been overhauled key limit the number of big plays nine georgia players x2014 nine x2014 recorded gains of 20-plus yards in last season x2019 s matchup that x2019 s what turned the game into a 52-28 blowout missouri despite a strong offensive showing to start couldn x2019 t keep up with a team as talented as georgia mizzou will be the underdog again this season but to keep the game close and give itself a chance missouri can x2019 t allow as many huge gains as the tigers did when they last faced georgia the bulldogs are the favorites to win the sec east and even though they x2019 re replacing some key players from last season x2019 s team that made it to the national championship game they should still be one of the most-talented teams in the country key contain deebo samuel this will be a good early test for a missouri secondary that needs to improve from a season ago samuel might be the best skill-position player mizzou faces this season he tied for the team lead in touchdowns last season six despite playing just three games one of those three was against missouri against the tigers he ran for a 25-yard touchdown caught five passes for 45 yards and returned a kickoff 97 yards for a score key play perfectly this might seem a little too general but it x2019 s true alabama is the favorite to win the league and the college football playoff yet again though the crimson tide replaces 11 starters nick saban x2019 s coaching staff recruits the top players in the country and will always have talent to plug in holes by this point in the season that talent will be experienced this is the one game on mu x2019 s schedule that the tigers seem to have no shot of winning x2014 unless everything breaks their way that will start with keeping drew lock upright so he has a chance to make big plays against a bama secondary that replaces both cornerbacks and its top two safeties from a season ago key stop the running backs memphis is replacing one of the most productive quarterbacks in the country riley ferguson as well as his two his top receiving targets so stifling memphis x2019 running game will likely become even more important to beating the opposing tigers memphis x2019 top two tailbacks from last season darrell henderson and patrick taylor jr. are both back for their junior seasons they combined for 2,020 rushing yards last season key make the wildcats win through the air kentucky x2019 s strength will be running the ball as the wildcats still have junior benny snell who ran for more than 1,000 yards in each of the past two seasons snell doesn x2019 t many proven offensive threats around him though no quarterback on the kentucky roster has played in an fbs game and no returning wildcat caught more than 30 passes last season mizzou should feel comfortable zeroing on the run assuming the tigers x2019 secondary is improved and the wildcats x2019 passing attack is as bleak as it currently appears key get into the backfield florida returns five starters from an offensive line that was coached by current mu line coach brad davis but those starters are the same men who helped uf allow the most sacks in the sec this past season 37 how much improvement can the gators x2019 offense show in their first season under new head coach dan mullen last season mullen x2019 s offense at mississippi state tied mizzou for the last sacks allowed in the league with 13 key put the game away early mizzou faces a difficult schedule this season and to improve its record from a season ago the tigers need to take care of the games they are supposed to win this home matchup against vanderbilt qualifies as one of those games vandy has a new defensive coordinator but the commodores x2019 defense could be porous yet again after struggling mightily during sec play a season ago mizzou has the offensive weapons to quickly bury vandy with big plays just as the tigers did last year when they led the commodores 35-0 at the half key own the line of scrimmage tennessee will have an inexperienced offensive line that struggled a season ago when it allowed the most tackles for loss 64 and sacks 32 in league play on defense new head coach jeremy pruitt is transitioning the vols into a 3-4 defensive front three down linemen and four linebackers with this being pruitt x2019 s first year the scheme change might come with some growing pains key force three-and-outs the razorbacks are transitioning into an up-tempo spread attack under new head coach chad morris but their personnel better fits a pro-style offense focused on pounding the ball the style former head coach bret bielema preferred so arkansas should at struggle to play the way morris wants next season which means they could record plenty quick and empty drives the sort that sometimes plagued missouri in josh heupel x2019 s spread offense if mizzou can force arkansas into enough quick three-and-outs the tigers x2019 offense will face a tired razorback defense and this could be a blowout by laura bauer judy l. thomas act now to get a
