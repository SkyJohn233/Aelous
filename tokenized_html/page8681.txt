29f winds wnw at 10 to 15 mph updated november 18 2019 7:30 pm fargo james madison s backups were better than north dakota state s backups that was a blunt assessment from ndsu head coach chris klieman on tuesday march 21 the day before his team is scheduled to open spring football practice the dukes ended ndsu s 2016 season with an fcs semifinal playoff victory at gate city bank field at the fargodome ending the bison s five-year reign as the fcs national champion klieman said the next 15 spring practices could go a long way in closing that gap we know who the really good players are on our roster he said it s the next 25 guys we need to find out this spring that we can count on to help us come next fall because we can t play 20 guys and have them play every special team and every snap to be successful. and it s been awhile since klieman didn t resort to some sort of cheat sheet to recite the number of players who will miss spring ball because of injuries really it s down to three linebacker nick deluca defensive tackle nate tanguay and tight end nate jenson deluca is full speed from a shoulder injury and will go through limited practice situations tanguay who tore his acl should be full speed by the beginning of summer klieman said and jenson is recovering from hip surgery so for the most part it s all hands on deck the hands that will get the hardest look however may be the faces nobody saw last fall ndsu redshirted its entire freshman class for the first time since 2007 and some of those players may be counted on to push the current backups for playing time for the first time we re really getting our hands on these guys klieman said there are a number of guys that we re excited about and there s always a surprise or two none of us know about. of the

subscription try digital for 25¢ a week the depth chart is pretty fluid klieman said there are a lot of young we re going to take a look at a lot of positions we ll have a better idea of what some of these guys can do at the end of spring. of the veterans senior austin kuhnert was moved from center to right guard it s part of an offensive line that was the position group hit the hardest by graduation with the loss of landon lechler jack plankers and zack johnson junior tanner volson who started two games last season is taking over at center junior luke bacon is the starting right tackle and senior bryce messer is beginning the spring as the starting left guard we lost three great players there klieman said of the offensive line we ll have to do a lot of shuffling around there but we have a lot of good young players … who have the ability to step up hopefully that will create some competition and let us be a little more versatile. the bison went 12-2 last season and for the first time since 2010 will begin spring drills without a fresh national title on their finger klieman said for the first time in his six years at ndsu it s the first time the players have had a full eight weeks of winter workouts the players are anxious to get out there and compete he said ten players left the team since last season but none of them saw much playing time the notable departures were receivers khayvon hawkins and isaiah frandsen and safety isaac cenescar hawkins played in 22 games but did not have a catch and frandsen had one crucial reception a 2014 playoff grab against sam houston state cenescar played in 10 games over two seasons we 'll send breaking news and news alerts to you as as they happen pdf display ad pdf display ad pdf display ad pdf display ad pdf display ad
