like a daunting amount of money to just set aside in a savings account so look for ways to make saving a priority and don t lose sight of this goal one way to stay focused is to pay yourself first set

want for example if you re used to hiring a babysitter so that the two of you can head out for dinner with friends look for less expensive ways to still spend time with friends this might mean swapping babysitting with other parents going out when grandparents are available to spend time with your kids or spending time with friends while you re doing an activity that satisfies your children your circle of friends will likely shift but that doesn t mean that you have to lose touch with everyone forever your kids will be older before you know it just because your wife is giving up her paycheques doesn t mean that she can t earn any income to supplement what you bring home she might be able to offer another family some help with child care or work a few shifts when you re home with the kids some work outside of the home can be a much needed sanity break as she adjusts to being out of the workforce full time another way to generate additional income is by looking at your home determine if you can make room to take in a student or tenant maybe you can rent out the garage or outside storage space be creative and look for ways to make it work rather than excuses to avoid trying it out as you become a one income family whatever you decide to do make sure that you don t overwhelm yourselves with too many changes all at once try to avoid drastic all or nothing spending cuts and give yourselves time to get used to living a less expensive lifestyle commit to working through the ups and down together and you ll survive the emotional changes that accompany the financial
