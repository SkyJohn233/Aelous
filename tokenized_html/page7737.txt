in private accounting then went into public and went with my partner to manage our own firm after a year i went from an entry-level position to an owner q are you optimistic about the future for women in stem fields a yes certainly i think with the number of women who have gone into this field i think the opportunities are there if you want to take advantage of them i still have the attitude that i
