$99 Clearance/Open Box at Menards. Was so impressed, I had to go find something to scrape. : Tools " Discontinued "  so it &# x27;s $109 online:  https://www.menards.com/main/home-decor/craft-supplies/oscillating-tools-accessories/fein-multitalent-start-q-starlockplus-oscillating-multi-tool-kit-13-piece/fmt250qsl/p-1492669217843-c-12869.htm?tid=5181992728351298836 & ipos=1 Yeah, they are already limited to Bosch and masterforce. Used to love menards, but no makita or milwaukee tools. So home depot it is. Some of my buddies in the trades introduced me to these oscillating tools calling them,  " wiggle saws. " All gives me a laugh We call them ‚ÄúJiggly Saws‚Äù. They are awesome. Thats a great deal to get you into the Starlock world. How about that long cord! Yeah, the is 16‚Äô long. I have an older one, does the star lock still use the pin? That‚Äôs a ridiculous price, amazing buy! üëç Is the speed variable? Yes So I bought one of these years ago and the kit cost like $600. A few years later they lose their patent and everyone is making them. I still have the original and I &# x27;ve added a cordless Dewalt also. As I &# x27;ve said not the first tool you grab but the one you grab when none of the others can. Would this be good for removing rusty metal from my car, or should I just get a regular angle grinder? How much rust and where? So I &# x27;m in need of a multi tool like right now and deciding between this and the Ridgid for 80 bucks. How do you like yours? Think it &# x27;s worth the extra 30? I got the Astro Pneumatic air scraper, and I had to go find something immediately as well Nice score! I made 3 separate trips to my local Menard &# x27;s today while working on a project... Didn &# x27;t find a deal that good though. 79.2k Members 459 Online Sep 29, 2009 Cake Day
