Linda Fae Buchanan sentenced to 9 months of house arrest | CBC News A long, drawn-out fraud case came to an end in a Halifax courtroom Monday, as Linda Fae Buchanan was sentenced to nine months house arrest and three years probation for fraud and breach of trust. Some of the charges against Buchanan, 58, date back to 2009 and stem from her time as the head of various talent and modelling agencies. One of the victims was an eight-year-old girl who was never paid for work she did in a Government of Canada ad campaign. Buchanan also organized fashion trade shows across the country. She collected fees from would-be exhibitors but the shows never happened and the money was never refunded. In total, Buchanan stole $5764.30, according to the Crown. She &# x27;s been ordered to make restitution for the full amount but has until May 2020 to pay it all back. When given an opportunity to speak before she was sentenced, Buchanan told the court she regretted what she did. " Am I sorry to see all of it happened? "  Buchanan asked rhetorically. " Absolutely. I didn &# x27;t do this deliberately, "  she said.  " I completely ruined my life. " Judge Anne Derrick interrupted Buchanan in the midst of her comments. " I &# x27;m not hearing a lot of remorse, "  Derrick said.  " It was criminal misconduct, that &# x27;s what it was, "  the judge added. The judge went on to admonish Buchanan. " On two occasions when things have gone south you have committed crimes, "  Derrick said.  " My concern is to protect the public. " Buchanan has a prior fraud conviction for buying a car with a bank account that didn &# x27;t have enough money to cover the purchase. Buchanan was ordered to make restitution for the $13,000 cost of the car. Court was told that so far she &# x27;s repaid only $3,000. Buchanan now operates a daycare out of her Cape Breton home. She admitted in court she will never be able to return to the modelling and talent agent business. But she told the judge she hopes to get back into promoting trade shows. Derrick said Buchanan can only be involved in trade shows if she &# x27;s working for someone else. Buchanan &# x27;s sentence conditions include that she not be in charge of any such shows in the future. With files from Blair Rhodes Audience Relations, CBC  >P.O.
