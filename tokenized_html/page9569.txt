pacific coast electricians for quite a lot of projects around our house.paul garcia was the electrician dispatched out on the first day in this initial appointment he came prepared to do whatever work/projects i needed doing but pacific coast electricians also want to get to know you as a customer they want to build a professional relationship from the start paul reviewed all of my issues with me and pointed out my many options i learned a great deal from paul i 'm an it engineer by trade but i 'm no electrician and i 'm honestly more than a tad afraid of messing around with it all i was mildly electrocuted when i was around age 4 so i know when i 'm in need of pros and i definitely found that with pacific coast electricians with paul representing them.for this first day along with the inspections and consulting paul replaced our dining room 'old school style dimmer dial switch with a modern single touch dimmer his work was efficient clean and neat.from that appointment paul helped me to set up a game plan for our home projects which include multiple ceiling fan replacements bathroom ceiling fan replacements ceiling dome light replacements track lighting replacements dining room chandelier replacement etc.in our second appointment paul took care of some of the ceiling fans and chandelier and track lighting paul also discovered behind one of our gfci outlets in our kitchen that some wires were loose and he further discovered clear scorching from some arcing back there.we now know that after the first of the year we want to set up a game plan for inspecting and swapping out all of our home 's electrical sockets and light switches our manufactured home was built on 2005 and we purchased it in 2010 we want the peace of mind of knowing our electrical system is healthy and optimal.and thanks to pacific coast electricians and paul garcia we will have that peace of mind.we complete and absolutely recommend pacific coast electricians whole heartedly 5.0 star

installed 18 recessed lights on the first floor and upstairs adding new dimmer switches he also routed hdmi cable to the new tv location through walls and ceiling work is done on time and with quality it was very easy to work with mark i do recommend bay lighting and power co. and i would hire them again. 5.0 star review from a homeowner in cupertino ca installed track-light and coax cable outlet for tv installing the coax was more challenging than anticipated but he finished patiently without extra charge professional and courteous. 5.0 star review from a homeowner in saratoga ca monte responded almost immediately to my home advisor quote request he is a sole owner so he does all the appointments and all the work i was able to schedule an appointment very quickly at my convenience it was a simple case of installing a new lighting fixture in place of an old non-functioning one he made it clear on the phone that it would save me money if i had the fixture there for him when he arrived and so i purchased the light at orchard supply in advance he told me that he charges 175 just to come out but thought that if i had the fixture it would not cost more than that while that seems extreme i was quoted 300 for a service call by another company so i think that is just what electricians go for in our area he has a sweet quiet dog that he keeps in his truck monte arrived promptly he was courteous and friendly and completed the job quickly i would definitely hire him again 5.0 star review from a homeowner in belmont ca denis is great to deal with great personality and
