Delivery - The Back Yard Depot The Back Yard Depot Access is required for delivery. If you need help, we will look at your land to access the obstacles. If a normal delivery cannot be done with a pickup truck and trailer, then a crane will be necessary. If we determine that a crane is necessary, there will be an extra fee determined by the crane company after they do a site inspection. The average small crane starts off at $350-450, but the final price is given after the site inspection. The crane fee is paid directly to crane company by customer. It is a Landowners responsibility to know the exact location of structure, according to local buildings, codes, and personal preference. Check with your local building/zoning dept. 2598 S.
