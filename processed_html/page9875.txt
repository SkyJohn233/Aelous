Pantoea stewartii  subsp.  stewartii  is indigenous to the Americas and has been introduced to other parts of the world with maize seeds. It causes a disease called Stewart's wilt. The principal host is  Zea mays  (maize), especially sweet corn, but dent, flint, flour and pop corn cultivars can also be infected. In the Americas,  Chaetocnema pulicaria  Melsheimer (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is the only known efficient vector and the main overwintering site of the bacterium. Asymptomatic infection of maize with  P. stewartii  subsp.  stewartii  is not known to occur.  Pantoea stewartii  subsp.  stewartii  may be transmitted in seed, and has occasionally been found to be able to overwinter in soil, manure or maize stalks. However, these means of survival are of little importance compared with the insect vectors which harbour the pathogen during their overwintering period, and transfer the bacterium from one plant to another during the growing season. Further information on the biology, distribution and economic importance of the disease is provided by EPPO/CABI ( 1997 ) and in the EPPO Global Database (EPPO,  2016 ).          A flow diagram describing the diagnostic procedure for  P. stewartii  subsp.  stewartii  is presented in Fig. 1 .          Name:  Pantoea stewartii  subsp.  stewartii  (Smith, 1898) Mergaert  et al . ( 1993 ).          Synonyms:  Erwinia stewartii  (Smith, 1898) Dye 1963;  Xanthomonas stewartii  (Smith, 1898) Dowson 1939.          Taxonomic position:  Bacteria, Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Enterobacteriales,  Enterobacteriacae .          EPPO code:  ERWIST.          Phytosanitary categorization:  EPPO A2 List no. 54; EU Annex II/A1.          The bacterium may be found on/in seeds of maize. No characteristic symptoms are visible on infected seeds. In maize plants, the first phase of the disease, which may affect the plants at the seedling stage, is wilting. The bacterium spreads systemically through the vascular system. If infected during a late growth stage, plants may reach a reasonable size. Leaves develop pale‐green to yellow longitudinal streaks, with irregular or wavy margins, which are parallel to the veins and may extend for the length of the leaf (Fig. 2 ; other pictures can be seen in the EPPO Global Database,  https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/ERWIST/photos ). These streaks dry out and turn brown. Small water‐soaked spots may develop on the husk of the cobs. Bacteria may exude in fine yellowish droplets on the inner face of the husk. Plants that are not killed may produce bleached, dead tassels. Cavities may appear close to the soil in the stalk pith of severely infected plants.  Pantoea stewartii  subsp.  stewartii  is able to penetrate the seed through wounds and via the xylem, and causes infection under the seed coat but is not able to enter the embryo. Sweet corn is particularly susceptible to seed infection. Field and dent corn are more susceptible to another phase, namely leaf blight, usually most apparent after tasselling. Short to long, irregular, pale‐green to yellow streaks, which originate from feeding marks of the corn flea beetle ( Chaetocnema pulicaria ), appear along the veins of leaves. Whole leaves sometimes become straw‐coloured and die. Diseased and weakened plants are more susceptible to fungal stalk rots.             The disease may be confused with other leaf blights: Five to ten leaves, cobs and/or, tassels with typical symptoms are collected from the inspected plot (field) for laboratory examination. Seed‐to‐seedling transmission of  P. stewartii  subsp.  stewartii  may occur at low rates in seed lots with  > 1% kernel infection (Pataky  &  Ikin,  2003 ). For seed lots, the usually recommended sample size is 400 seeds per lot corresponding to a 95% probability of detecting an infestation level of 1%.             Plant parts (leaf, husk, tassel) showing symptoms are surface sterilized in 70% ethanol for 5–10 s, rinsed with sterile water and excised at the leading edge of the lesions. Plant parts are then macerated in a plastic bag with a hand homogeniser (or in a mortar with a pestle) with a few millilitres of sterile phosphate buffer (PB) or comminuted (lightly ground) in a sterile Petri dish with sterile PB. An appropriate aliquot of the extract is transferred into a tube to be used in immunofluorescence (IF) staining. The remaining part of the extract is collected in sterile disposable plastic tubes and used immediately and/or stored at approximately 4–10°C or on ice for future use/reference purposes. For samples showing symptoms, direct isolation should be performed immediately after maceration. The 400‐seed sample is divided into subsamples of up to 100 seeds each and put into plastic bags. Seeds treated with any plant protection product should be washed under running tap water until the water runs clear, to remove product from the seed surface (in such cases, the report should mention that the seeds were treated). Sterile PB equal to twice the seed weight is added to the subsamples, and the bag is then closed. The subsamples are incubated in refrigerator at 4–10°C overnight. After incubation, the soaked seeds are shaken on a (rotary) shaker at room temperature for at least 1 h at approximately 200 r.p.m. The soaking liquid from seeds is centrifuged at approximately 10 000 g  for approximately 10 min at 4–10°C. The pellet is resuspended in 1/10 of the original liquid volume of sterile PB and collected in sterile disposable plastic tubes for further testing, and stored at approximately 4–10°C or on ice. Macerates should be used immediately if at room temperature or within 24 h if stored at 4–10°C. Although it is not recommended, macerates may be stored below −18°C with 10–30% glycerol for several weeks for further testing, but isolation can be impaired.             IF and real‐time PCR have been evaluated in the framework of a Euphresco project (Euphresco,  2010  unpublished report) and are recommended for use as screening tests. The conventional PCR test (PCR A with AGES primers) presented in Appendix 3  has been used in one laboratory for testing seed extracts but cannot be recommended as a screening test without further laboratory validation.             The plant and seed extracts and their 10× and 100× dilutions in PB are used for indirect IF staining. Indirect IF staining is preferably done using specific monoclonal antibodies. Those from Linaris (Dossenheim, DE) showed the best performance in the Euphresco test performance study (Euphresco,  2010  unpublished report). The IF test procedure is described in PM 7/97  Indirect immunofluorescence test for plant pathogenic bacteria  (EPPO,  2009 ).                Specific information on polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies that can be used and the performance criteria obtained using these antibodies are included in Appendix 2 .                The pathogen can be detected by real‐time PCR performed on the macerates obtained from symptomatic plant parts or after soaking of seeds (Tambong  et al .,  2008 ). The test is described in Appendix 4 .                As the number of viable cells decreases quickly in macerates, isolation should be done within 24 h. For longer preservation, the suspension should be stored below −18°C with 10–30% glycerol, but this extended storage may impair isolation. The suspensions from symptomatic plant material and seed extracts are serially diluted in 10‐fold steps up to 1:10 000 in PB (see Appendix 1 ). One hundred microlitres of each dilution is spread over the surface on at least one of the following media: King's B supplemented, nutrient‐broth yeast extract agar (NBY) and/or yeast peptone glucose agar (YPGA) (see Appendix 1 ). Plates are incubated at approximately 25–27°C, and examined after 2–5 days for typical colonies of  P. stewartii  subsp.  stewartii . One to five isolated colonies with typical morphology are used for further analysis. Final reading of the plates should be done after 5 days. Colonies are lemon to orange‐yellow or pale‐yellow, flat to convex, transparent, with entire edges and slow growing. On King's B agar strains developing colonies with a different appearance have been observed (Fig. 3 A).                The cells are Gram‐negative, straight short rods (0.4–0.7 × 0.9–1.7 μm). When IF is performed on colonies (see Section 4), colonies should be cultured on YPGA or subcultured on nutrient agar (NA). IF pictures are shown in Fig. 4 .                Some laboratories also use a slide agglutination test using their own polyclonal antiserum. Identification of pure cultures of presumptive  P. stewartii  subsp.  stewartii  isolates should be carried out using at least two tests based on different biological principles. The recommended tests are indicated below.          A suspension prepared from 1–3‐day‐old bacterial growth of presumptive  P. stewartii  subsp.  stewartii  isolates on NA or YPGA is used for indirect IF staining using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. The procedure for the IF test is described in PM 7/97  Indirect immunofluorescence test for plant pathogenic bacteria  (EPPO,  2009 ). Specific information on polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies that can be used and performance criteria obtained using these antibodies are included in Appendix 2 .                   An ELISA test for presumptive  P. stewartii  subsp.  stewartii  isolates can be performed using a kit from Agdia (Elkhart, US), following the supplier's instructions. Detailed instructions are provided in PM 7/101  ELISA tests for plant pathogenic bacteria  (EPPO,  2010b ).                   Two conventional PCR test and a real‐time PCR test are described in Appendices 3  and  4 .                   Because of the low sensitivity of the conventional PCR test described in Appendix 4  (≤10 7 cfu mL –1 ), a sufficient amount of pure culture should be produced.                   Analysis of chromosomal DNA can be performed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) as described by Zhang  &  Geider ( 1997 ) or by rep‐PCR following Louws  et al . ( 1994 ). Detailed instructions for rep‐PCR are provided in PM 7/100  Rep‐PCR tests for identification of bacteria  (EPPO,  2010a ).                   Multilocus sequence analysis (Brady  et al .,  2008 ), based on partial sequences of the  gyrB ,  rpoB ,  atpD  and  infB  genes, have been used to differentiate  P. stewartii  subsp.  stewartii  from the other species of the genus  Pantoea .  Pantoea stewartii  subsp.  stewartii  can be distinguished from its close relative subsp.  indologenes , although sequence similarity between the subspecies is high (e.g. up to 99% for  gyrB ).                   Fatty acid analysis is carried out using the MIDI system (Newark, US) and Agilent equipment as described by Janse ( 1991 ) and Stead  et al . ( 1992 ).                Morphological and biochemical tests: the morphological and biochemical properties of  P. stewartii  subsp.  stewartii  isolates are as listed in Table 1 .             In critical cases when a positive result is obtained, confirmation by pathogenicity test should be performed to confirm infection by  P. stewartiii  subsp  stewartii . Procedures for pathogenicity tests are given in Appendix 5 .             NCPPB 2295 (= CFBP 3167), NCPPB 449 (= CFBP 3168). Guidance on reporting and documentation is given in EPPO Standard PM 7/77 (EPPO,  2006 ).          When performance criteria are available they are provided with the description of the test. Validation data is also available in the EPPO Database on Diagnostic Expertise ( http://dc.eppo.int ) and it is recommended to consult this database as additional information may be available there (e.g. more detailed information on analytical specificity, full validation reports, etc.).

Media King's B medium supplemented (King  et al .,  1954 )             200 mg L −1  of nystatin (or 200 mg L −1  of cycloheximide) should be added after autoclaving.             Yeast peptone glucose agar (YPGA) Nutrient‐broth yeast extract agar (NBY) (Schaad  et al .,  2001 )             To prepare the medium add all components, except the glucose and MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O solutions, to distilled water and bring the volume to 900 mL. Mix thoroughly, gently heat and bring to the boil. Autoclave and cool to 50°C, add the glucose and MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O solutions, mix thoroughly and pour on plates.             NBY base d (+) glucose solution             Filter sterilize MgSO 4  solution             Loewe polyclonal antibodies and Linaris monoclonal antibodies can be used. 1.1.  Performance criteria for detection in seed with the Linaris monoclonal antibody  (EUPH05  P. stewartii  subsp.  stewartii ; EUPHRESCO Final Report  2010 ). The test performance study involved 2 laboratories. The samples in the test performance study were spiked seed extracts.             1.2.  Performance criteria for detection in seed with the Loewe polyclonal antibody  (EUPH05  P. stewartii  subsp.  stewartii ; Euphresco,  2010 ). The test performance study involved 2 laboratories. The samples in the test performance study were spiked seed extracts.             1.3.  Performance criteria for identification  (EUPH05  P. stewartii  subsp. s tewartii ; Euphresco,  2010 )             The commercially available Agdia kit can only be recommended for identification (not for detection) because of the low analytical sensitivity. 2.1. Performance criteria for identification using the Agdia kit  (EUPH05  P. stewartii  subsp. s tewartii ; Euphresco,  2010 ). The test performance study involved 3 laboratories.             EUPH05  Pantoea stewartii  subsp. s tewartii  (Euphresco,  2010 ). The test was evaluated in the framework of the Euphresco research project (EUPH05  P. stewartii  subsp.  stewartii , 2008–2009).             The bacterial suspension is heated at 95°C for 10 min and cooled on ice. No DNA extraction was performed for seed extracts in the test performance study performed in the framework of Euphresco project. Two laboratories also performed the test with DNA extraction, which seemed to improve the analytical sensitivity of the test; however, this should be confirmed by further test performance studies (Euphresco,  2010 ).             95°C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s and 72°C for 7 min. The number of cycles can be increased up to 40 cycles for direct detection of  P. stewartii  subsp . stewartii  from seed extracts. (NB: Performance criteria indicated under paragraph 4 of this appendix are based on cycling conditions with 30 cycles.) The PCR product is separated in 1.5% agarose gel at 1.5 V cm −1 . The DNA fragment is stained in ethidium bromide solution (0.5 μg mL −1  in TAE buffer) for 30 min.             Verification of the controls: When these conditions are met: These performance criteria are based on colonies as the nucleic acid source and 30 PCR cycles. The samples in the test performance study were spiked seed extracts (EUPH05  P. stewartii  subsp. s tewartii ; Euphresco,  2010 ).             False positive results have been obtained with  P. stewartii  subsp.  indologenes  (please note that this species has different biochemical characteristics from subsp.  stewartii ; see Table 1).             A colony from the suspected culture is suspended in 100 μL of sterile 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) in a microvial. The closed vials are heated at 95°C for 10 min and the suspension is then cooled on ice. Alkalysis may be used to improve isolation of DNA from the bacterial cells [the sample of 100 μL is treated with 50 μL 0.25 M NaOH, heated for 10 min at 95°C, put on ice for 2 min, treated with 50 μL 0.25 M HCl and 25 μL 0.5 M Tris‐HCl (pH 8.0) with 0.1% Tween‐20, heated for 10 min at 95°C and put on ice for 2 min]. PCR cycling conditions: 95°C for 4 min, 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 45 s (for Corbett Research RG‐300 thermocycler). The PCR product is separated in 1.5% agarose gel at 1.5 V cm −1 . The DNA fragment is stained in ethidium bromide solution (0.5 μg mL −1  in TAE buffer) for 30 min.             PCR cycling conditions: 95°C for 10 min, 25 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 55°C for 15 s, 72°C for 30 s (for Corbett Research RG‐300 thermocycler). The PCR product is separated in 1.5% agarose gel at 1.5 V cm −1 . The DNA fragment is stained in ethidium bromide solution (0.5 μg mL −1  in TAE buffer) for 30 min.             Verification of the controls When these conditions are met:                4.1. Performance criteria for identification  (based on intra‐laboratory validation)             The test was evaluated in the framework of the Euphresco research project (EUPH05  P. stewartii  ssp.  stewartii , 2008–2009).             No DNA extraction is required according to Tambong  et al . (2008) and the Euphresco test performance study.             The following external controls should be included: Verification of the controls When these conditions are met: False positive results have been obtained with  P. stewartii  subsp.  indologenes  (please note that this species has different biochemical characteristics from subsp.  stewartii ; see Table 1 ).             The pathogenicity test is carried out on 10 plants by stem inoculation of 8–14‐day‐old (1–2 leaf stage) plants of a susceptible cultivar of maize (e.g. ‘Jubilee’, ‘Meritosa’, ‘Sweet Surprise F 1 ) grown in a glasshouse. Test plants should be grown at 22–28°C under high relative humidity (70–80%) with appropriate watering to avoid wilting due to water deficiency. Plants are needle inoculated using a sterile hypodermic syringe, with a bacterial suspension (10 7 –10 8  cells/mL) prepared in sterile distilled water or phosphate buffer (pH 7) from isolates identified as  P. stewartii  subsp.  stewartii , incubated for approximately 2 days at 25–28°C on King's B or preferably on NA (‘poor’ medium). Negative control plants are inoculated with sterile distilled water only. After inoculation, plants are kept in a humid chamber for 1–2 days at 25–28°C. The first disease symptoms (streaking) may appear after 3–5 days, but 7 or more days are necessary for the more typical symptoms (water soaking, yellow pockets of ooze in the vascular tissues) to develop. Wilting symptoms generally appear 14 days after inoculation. In some cases, yellow bacterial ooze forms in the vascular system. Plants should be kept for observation for 20 days.             Re‐isolation from symptomatic tissues on media listed previously and checking of the colonies for identification should be performed – some bacteria other than  P. stewartii  subsp . stewartii  (e.g.  Pantoea agglomerans ) can cause water‐soaked symptoms around wounds if stem‐inoculated into maize, but without ooze formation.
