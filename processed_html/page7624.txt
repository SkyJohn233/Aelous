Automatically save open files before build By default Eclipse will not save any unsaved changes of open files when a build process is started. This is usually undesirable when  Build Automatically  is switch off. To change this open the Eclipse preferences ( Window > Preferences... ) and go the the  General  - > Workspace  tab, then set the  Save automatically before build  option. See  Workbench User Guide  >  Tasks  >  Building resources  >  Saving resources automatically before a manual build  for the offical Eclipse documention off this feature.. This information is included here because it is a frequently asked question.
