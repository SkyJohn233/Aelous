Silent Hill The Room - PC - Torrents Games Silent Hill is a town where pure evil permeates the air and the soil and eventually consumes the people. It s a soothing vacation spot that masks demon-worshipping cults and dark purpose. Each of the previous titles in the Silent Hill series of horror games has either outright taken place in the titular small town or has gradually been pulled there through some terrible inertia. Silent Hill 4: The Room breaks this trend, because it takes place in the neighboring city of South Ashfield and centers mainly on an ill-fated apartment building, a cursed apartment, and the man who lives in it.  accountx March 14, 2016 at 19:34 Works great and fast download ?
