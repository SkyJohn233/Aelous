profit and loss problems wordpandit in this article we simply cover the different types of profit and loss problems that are based on the concepts of profit and loss in this article we do not cover any concepts as such and simply focus on the different problem types that feature in various examinations in this article you simply practice the different profit and loss problem types for concept articles refer to the three previous articles for this topic if the price of an item increases by r then the percentage reduction in consumption so that expenditure remains the same is question 1 if price of sugar increases by 20 then the percentage reduction in consumption so that expenditure remains the same will be solution to find the percentage reduction in consumption apply formula 20/120 x100=50/3 question 2 if the price of sugar falls down by 10 by how much percent must a householder increase its consumption so as not to decrease expenditure in this item solution to find the percentage increase in consumption apply formula 10/ 100-10 x 100 100/9 question 3 a reduction of 10 in the price enables a person to buy 2 kg more wheat for rs 30.find the reduced and the original price of wheat solution reduced price x/100y a 30 x 10 100 x 2 rs rs 3/2 original price x/ 100-x y x a 30 x 10 100 10 x2 rs 5/3 when there are two successive profits of x and y then the net percentage profit x+y+xy/100 when there is a profit of x and loss of y then net percentage profit or loss x y xy/100 note if the final sign in the above expression is positive then there is net profit but if it is negative then there is net loss question 4 a sells an item at a profit of 20 to b and b sells it to c at a profit of 10 find the resultant profit percent solution when there are two successive profit of x and y net profit percentage x+y+ xy/100 20+ 10 20 x 10 /100 32 question 5 a sells an item at a profit of 20 to b and b sells it to c at a loss of 10 .find the resultant profit percent solution when there are two successive profit of x and y net profit percentage x y xy/100 20 10 20 x 10 /100 8 a sells goods to b at a profit of x and b sells it to c at a profit of y if c pays rs x for it then the cost price for a is rs question 6 a sells a good to b at a profit of 20 and b sells it to c at a profit of 25 .if c pays rs 222 for it calculate the cost price for a is solution applying formula 222 x 100 x 100 120 x 125 rs 148 note for loss replace plus sign with minus question 7 each of the two cars is sold at the same price a profit of 20 is made on the first and a loss of 10 on second.calculate loss/gain apply formula 100 20 10 -2 x 20 x 10 100+20 100-10 20/7 question 8 two items are sold for rs 200.the first one is sold at 20 profit and second one at 20 loss what is the loss or gain solution apply formula as percentage profit is equal to percentage loss so put p=l we get loss p 2 /100 loss 20 2 /100 4 example 9 the cost price of 18 articles is equal to the selling price of 15 articles the gain per cent is solution profit percentage x-y/y *100 gain percentage 18 15 /15 x 100 3/15 x 100 20 example 10 the cost price of 25 articles is equal to selling price of 20 ar­ticles the gain percent is solution profit percentage x-y/y 100 gain 25-20 /20 x100 5/20 x 100 25 question 1 an article is sold at a loss of 10 had it been sold for rs 9 more there would have been a gain of 25/2 on it the cost price of the article is a rs 40 b rs 45 c rs 50 d rs 35 let the cost price of the article rs x s.p at 10 loss rs 0.9x according to question if it is sold by rs 9 more there will be gain of 25/2 question 2 a man sold an article at a loss of 20 if he has sold that article for rs 12 more he would have gained 10 find the cost price of that article a rs 60 b rs 40 c rs 30 d rs 22 let the cp be x sp at 20 loss rs 0.8x according to question 0.8x 12 1.1x 0.3x 12 x rs 40 question 3 if an article is sold for rs 178 at a loss of 11 what should be its selling price in order to earn a profit of 11 a rs 222.50 b rs 267 c rs 222 d rs 220 the article is sold at 11 loss 89 of cp rs 178 cp 178 x 100 /89 rs 200 to gain 11 s.p 111 of rs 200 111/100 x 200 rs 222 question 4 a businessman sells a commodity at 10 profit if he had bought it at 10 less and sold it for rs 2 less then he would have gained 50/3 the cost price of the commodity is a rs 32 b rs 36 c rs 40 d rs 48 alternate solution let the first cp of the be rs 100 first sp rs 110 second cp rs 90 gain 50/3 second sp 90 100+50/3 /100 rs 90 x 350/300 rs 105 difference of sps rs 110–105 rs 5 therefore if the difference in sp is rs 5 the cp rs 100 therefore if the difference in sp be rs 2 the cp 100/5 x 2 rs 40 question 5 a car worth rs 1,50,000 was sold by x to y at 5 profit y sold the car back to x at 2 loss in the entire transaction a x gained rs 4,350 b y lost rs 4,350 c x gained rs 3,150 d x lost rs 3,150 your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment comment comment
