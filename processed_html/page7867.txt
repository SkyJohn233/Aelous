cudaGetDeviceCount failed - Nvidia Cards - Hive OS Forum I’m getting this error using dstm miner, anyone knows what is happening? having same error. didn’t have any problem running 12x 1080s, suddenly it pops up… I just added a GTX 1070ti FTW to my rig and i am getting this error as well. From what i can find it sounds like it’s a driver issue.  Any idea if that is the case. I too am using the DSTM miner Figured it out… not enough power to the GPU.
