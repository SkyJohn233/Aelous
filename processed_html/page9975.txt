Definition at line  242  of file  reductionProblem.C . argList  Definition at line  103  of file  reductionProblem.H . Matrix that contains informations about the inlet boundaries.  The dimension is:   Rows = Number of parametrized boundary conditions   Cols = 2   Example:   example.inletIndex.resize(1, 2);   example.inletIndex(0, 0) = 0;   example.inletIndex(0, 1) = 0;   Means that there is one parametrized boundary conditions, the first col contains the index of the parametrized boundary, the second col contains the direction along which the BC is parametrized:   0 for x   1 for y   2 for z   The Matrix should be implemented in the following way: \[ \mbox{inletIndex}=\begin{bmatrix} \mbox{BC1_index}  &  \mbox{Direction of BC1} \\ \ \mbox{BC2_index}  &  \mbox{Direction of BC3} \\ \ \vdots  &  \vdots \\ \ \mbox{BCN_index}  &  \mbox{Direction of BCN} \ \ \end{bmatrix} \]  Definition at line  132  of file  reductionProblem.H .
