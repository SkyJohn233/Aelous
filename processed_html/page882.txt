A post shared by Amy Winegardner (@awinegardner13)  on  Apr 3, 2019 at 9:30am PDT Travelling around London on the Tube? Here are some other useful tips that will make your journey more enjoyable and efficient: London Underground opening times vary slightly from line to line, but the first London subway trains normally start running around 5am, from Monday to Saturday, with reduced operating hours on Sunday. London metro trains normally run until around midnight. Check with staff at the particular tube station you plan on using to find out exactly when the last train runs. A 24-hour underground service operates on certain lines. For more information, read our  Night Tube  page. Access to most Tube stations is via numerous steps. The London metro system can become very crowded at peak times and, therefore, difficult for those with mobility problems. Many deep-level Tube stations have escalators to platforms. But nearly all the stations with escalators or lifts also have stairs between street level and the ticket hall and/or between the escalator/lift and the platforms. The dowloadable Tube map on our  free London travel maps  page indicates which Tube stations are step-free. When boarding Tube trains, be aware that there is generally a step of up to 8 inches (20cm), either up or down, between the platform and the train. If this is problematic, travel in the first carriage, so the driver can see you more clearly, and allow enough time for you to get on or off.
