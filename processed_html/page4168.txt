In need of help with a chemistry question!? | Yahoo Answers Some antacid products that bubble when added to a glass of water contain both sodium bicarbonate and citric acid. When an antacid tablet is dropped in water, citric acid reacts with sodium bicarbonate. The chemical equation for this reaction is  NaHCO3(aq) + C6H8O7(aq) - >  H2O(I) + CO2(g) + NaC6H7O7(aq) a) What mass of C6H8O7 is needed to consume 0.42 g of NaHCO3? b) What mass of water is expected? 0.42g /  84.00g/mol = 0.0050 mols Its a 1:1 ratio so the moles of NaHCO3 are the same as Citric Acid 0.0050g *192.12g/mols =0.96 grams citic acid ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0.0050 mols * 1mol H2O / 1mol Citric acid = 0.0050 mol H2O 0.0050 * 18g/mol = 0.09 grams H2O Note the molar ratios in the eq &# x27;n are 1:1::1:1:1 Relative molecular mass(Mr) of NaHCO3  Na x 1 = 23 x 1 = 23 H x 1 = 1 x1 = 1  C x 1 = 12 x 1 = 12  O x 3 = 16 x 3 = 48  23 + 1 + 12 + 48 = 84  moles(NaHCO3) = 0.42 / 84 = 0.005 (Equivalent to  &# x27;1 &# x27; in the molar ratios above).  moles(C6H8O7) = 0.005  ( Equivalent to  &# x27;1 &# x27; in the molar ratios above).  Mr(C6H8O7) C x 6 = 12 x 6 = 72  H x 8 = 1 x 8 = 8  O x 7 = 16 x 7 = 112 v 72 + 8 + 112 = 192  mass(C6H8O7) = 0.005 x 192 = 0.96 g,  mass (H2O) = 0.005 x 18 = 0.09 g  Done!!!!
