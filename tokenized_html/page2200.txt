response thanks for your feedback hmm okay let 's start at the beginning access configuring itself means you have more than one version installed that does not mean just access it could be more than one version of office so what was the prior version when you installed did you accept the default location or did you point it to a new location i am going to assume you have tables in your database does the table icon have a little globe on it did this solve your problem sorry this didn t help great thanks for marking this as the answer how satisfied are you with this reply thanks for your

another version of access/office on the same machine it should not do the reinstall it only does this when opening different versions on the same machine so right away there is a problem since you uninstalled office 2000 might be there are still remnants and that is interfering with your access 2013 install if it were me i would 1 confirm office 2000 and all remnants have been uninstalled 2 go to the folder where the wizards are and rename all the extensions to .old 3 run a repair for access 2013 making sure to select custom insuring all the items are confirmed to install run from machine try again did this solve your problem sorry this didn t help great thanks for marking this as the answer how satisfied are you with this reply thanks for your feedback it helps us improve the site how satisfied are you with this response thanks for your feedback hi gina so i tried the above checked in programs and features under the control panel to be sure there were no old remnants of office 2000 sticking around and there was nothing renamed the wizards then ran the repair and still no dice when i start access it is still doing the configuration step and the wizards still do not work exactly as mentioned above is there another way to go back and see if i missed something from the old office 2000 installation did this solve your problem sorry this didn t help great thanks for marking this

microsoft access show up under program features 2 have you ever installed the access runtime any version on your machine if it is still installed you should uninstall and then run the repair again 3 have you tried to navigate to the folder and open access msaccess.exe from there does the same thing happen depending on the answer to the above the only other thing that comes to mind is to uninstall completely reboot and then reinstall did this solve your problem sorry this didn t help great thanks for marking this as the answer how satisfied are you with this reply thanks for your feedback it
