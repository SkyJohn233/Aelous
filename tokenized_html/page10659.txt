california i had no idea he had done that well allllllllllllll that money and he could n't keep his word to andrew short why would mc waste his more why would mc waste his money on a mid pack guy because he signed a more because he signed a contract how many business men fund businesses with their own personal money i am sure mc brooks and anybody else involved were operating under a llc or some other vehicle to protect their personal wealth seems like nobody knows what integrity is anymore stiffing people in the name of business is a low life shitty mentality and i hope people who live like that get what they deserve if a damn contract was signed then there is no excuse for stiffing short regardless of his performance they knew he was a midpack guy but he 's also a midpack guy in the toughest series on the fucking planet enabling thieves by calling it bussiness is utter bullshit not saying mc is either but i ca n't stand the bullshit business excuses i read on here business will never be a good reason to be a half assed lying cheating scumbag again not saying that 's mc motorcycle body armor protective gear built for progression safety speed there 's a guy on twitter who purchased for a good sum of a ride day with mc the proceeds i think went towards the cancer thing he did well the guy ca n't get in touch with mc or his publicist they are n't returning his calls now

to the story than that i grew up/started racing during his prime and absolutely loved him to this day he is still the only rider i have posters of hanging in my shop even my autographed ricky posters are rolled up and in a closet i have always looked up to him more for his down to earth human demeanor in addition to his revolutionary skills on a motorcycle it would be a huge letdown if he turned out to be a prick just like so many have there 's a guy on twitter more there 's a guy on twitter who purchased for a good sum of a ride day with mc the proceeds i think went towards the cancer thing

after seeing that lavish house i came to the conclusion that to keep his end of the deal with andrew would n't have put much of a dent in mcs net worth i guess we should blame scott witt of the now defunct langston/witt team for helping me feel the way i do his team folded and what did he do he kept his end of the deal with les smith by providing everything he said he would and found a good transport for him in bto sports ktm on a personal note back in 2008 i signed contracts to sell product to a couple of buyers when the market collapsed the value of the product went down by half yet these buyers who were the ones to offer me the deals in the first place kept their word and paid me the original contract price we agreed on they will forever have my loyalty as i know their word and thus their integrity is well and good i 'm sure jeremy is a great guy i admire the hell out of him but after seeing that incredible house i 'm just left feeling something could have been done for
