Typically, coupled initially to molecules containing primary amines by amide bonds buffered at pH 7.5 (6.5-8.5). Second coupling specific for molecules containing free sulfhydryl by thioether linkage buffered at pH 6.8 (6.5-7.0). Useful for preparation of enzyme immunoconjugates and hapten carrier molecule conjugates. Provides a 7-atom linker.         Certificate of Analysis (COA) Lot and Batch Numbers can be found on a product's labelfollowing the words 'Lot' or 'Batch'. Sigma Products More important for COO: enter a "0" if only two numbers arein front of the letter e.g. 62K1064 – you will only find the COO ifyou enter 062K1064.
