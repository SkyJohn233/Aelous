Dang Thai Food, Pai - Restaurant Reviews  &  Photos - TripAdvisor Just a hole in the wall good for a quick meal and I mean very good.  The lady can cook.  The yellow curry with brown rice is cheap and filling and an explosion of taste treat.  I could eat it every day which is tough... More Dang is right. Holy moly. On initial inspection, it’s another “oh that looks nice”. DO NOT WALK PAST. Looked busy and as we all know, this is a good sign. We sat down and I went straight to the toilets. To be honest with you,... More worst food poisoning ever. I NEVER FELT SO BAD IN MY LIFE. We have been there with 3 friends, and the day after we were all so sick, and it lasts many days... Great authentic food and healthy portions at a great price. Fruit drinks are cheaper than anywhere else and super good. The staff are really nice. Definitely recommend Our first time in Pai. We were told by everyone that Na’s Kitchen is the best Thai food in Pai. Unfortunately, it was closed at 8.30 pm on a Friday night. We then walked around and found this place. Service was slow and poor. The... More Rude waitress, horrible pad Thai, sticky mango is sour. They should shut down because they disgrace a great holiday resort. Probably the best khao soi ive ever had. And it ' s my favorite thai dish so i eat it everywhere in northern thailand.  I can ' t recommend it enough. Angry workers, especially the mother. They throw their frustration at the customers. Very unpleasant atmosphere. Despite being the quiet season my boyfriend and I came here virtually everyday during our visit in Pai. Best curry we’ve tried in Thailand! And for 50 baht per meal who can complain!!! This restaurant is very good if you are tired of the western food sold in a lot of the town and want good Thai food at a reasonable price. It bas nice traditional wooden furniture.
