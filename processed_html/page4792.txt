Fairly new to STS9, and recently discovered they might be one of my all-time favorite bands. Help point me in the right direction.... : STS9 Well, when I say new....Ive known about STS9 since maybe 2005. I saw them at Bonnaroo 2007 and was blown away. Somehow over the years I kinda forgot about them. I work as a programmer and needed some good instrumental tunes to block out all the office noise. Stumbled on STS9 at the Tabernacle last New Years on YouTube. Now all I do every day is blare these tunes. Im in love. So I want to see what you guys would share about STS9 with a newbie such as myself. favorite albums favorite songs favorite live shows any other info you want to pass along Oh yeah......most importantly: where can I find the best place to download their live stuff? I want to listen to everything. Help me out! Thanks guys. EDIT: just wanted to say thanks to all you good people that have shared their favorites, and shared their music with me. I can see we have a great community here. Im so excited for this new world I get to explore. so far my favorites are:  " When the Dust Settles "  @ the Tabernacle 12.31.15. I watch multiple times a day. Its one of the greatest things Ive ever seen. Loving Artifact. I keep going back to  " Tokyo " ....Im drawn to it. Love the  " When The Dust Settles "  EP. Ive never been into a group where the real magic is in their live shows.....so Im overwhelmed and excited by the amount of music I get to dive into. thanks yall. you have to listen to artifact. 2002-04 tribe is the golden era IMO, so many sets that you can just get lost in. 2004 area 51 shows. 2007 new years run. join  " people who love sector 9 "  on facebook. archive.org is good for some shows but quality can be hit or miss. you can buy soundboards. There is a no piracy rule here but depending on who you know or where you search there are lots of soundboard sharing facebook groups/websites. enjoy yourself. thanks for the info. been listening to Artifact on repeat the past two days. Tokyo is a highlight so far. so excited to have this whole new world to explore 10/31/2000 just do it. im on the case THE GEORGIA THEATER RUN FROM 2015. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH. 3.19.15, 3.20.15, and 3.21.15. Absolutely transcendant. Also Euphoria Festival 4.10.15. The Dance > Inspire will guaranteed melt your face off. Axe the cables from the Regeneration fest in 2011 is my favorite piece of live music ever recorded, no lie. GET IT. CIRCUS IS THE HAPPIEST SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD. (6.26.2011) Also, Axe the Cables from the Gates opera hall is ESSENTIAL. (12.29.2009) Also Boulder Theater 9.10.2015 Also Summer Camp Fest on 5.23.2015 Also the 8.26.16 Tabernacle Show. I &# x27;ve also really been into the 11.20.16 show lately. That should get you started. thanks to all you good people you know whats up! all some of my favorites, especially that athens run. the first night was insanity. the mobsters > surreality > eb to end the 2nd set. the EB provided me the biggest face melt of my life. As you can probably tell, I really like newer tribe a lot. It &# x27;s really just personal preference. check out both. both are amaxing. If you (or anyone) have soundboards for the 2015.03.19 and 2015.03.21 shows I &# x27;d love to get my hands on those. 2015.03.20 is one of my favorite shows and I &# x27;ve been dying to hear the other nights of the run. Will trade other SBDs I have. 2007-8-24 Sun Hall, Osaka Japan 2004 - 10-19 Area 51 2000-2007 is definitely my favorite range, but I love it all Welcome to the Tribe and a lifetime of listening enjoyment buncha good folks, yall are. thanks Georges Majestic 3/3/2010. That show is absolutely perfect from start to finish in my opinion. Equinox, Metameme, and Mischief of a Sleepwalker are especially good from that one (again, IMO). Subscribing to their drip.com account is a great way to start accessing their music ($10/month, 3 free show downloads up front, 1 free show download per month from music they uploaded before you subscribed, free downloads of all shows they upload after you subscribe). Otherwise archive.org might have some good taped shows for you to check out. Do I know you? I lived in Fayetteville for seven years, and I was at that show. I worked at Dickson Street Liquor for a couple years as well. My suggestions for starter songs... easy starters: Be Nice Vapors Simulator electronic leaning songs: Evasive Manuevers T.W.E.L.V.E. dance floor heaters: Love Don &# x27;t Terrorize World Go Round Four Year Puma jamsssssss: Gobnugget Dance much obliged good sah! Favorite songs in a sort of particular order: Circus, Breathe In, Baraka, Toyko, Somesing (all of Artifact for that matter), Instantly, Aimlessly, Firewall, Click Lang Echo. But let &# x27;s be real here, there really isn &# x27;t a Tribe song I don &# x27;t like. You said you were at Bonnaroo 2007. That is one of my favorite shows. Also, NYE 2007 > 08 and basically every Red Rocks set for the past several years. sooo glad I stumbled on them at the Roo. I was in a trance as soon as Instantly kicked in. thanks for the song list love the Click Lang mention. this is definitely a song I had trouble getting into... and is also probably the song that has grown on me the most. especially good when it is transitioned into or out of live. That Bonnaroo show was amazing, opening with instantly just makes everything happen... instantly! https://archive.org/details/sts9-02-12-30.shnf  Regency Center San Francisco, CA https://archive.org/details/sts9-2005-03-26.akg483.flac16  Freebird Live Jacksonville Beach, FL https://archive.org/details/sts9-2004-06-25  Mishawaka Amphitheatre Ft. Collins, CO My favorite sets. Covers pretty much all the great tracks. Red Rocks sets are all pretty good as well. Most are on youtube I was listening to the local independent radio station out of Nashville and they had an hour long interview with the guy who runs The Caverns.  He said that many of the artists that have played this year have already reached out to playing there again in 2020 and for multi day runs. He said that with them booking more from the “electronic jam” scene has been great for the venue as well as their bottom line so expect more! He said they also just bought a bunch of acres connected to the land The Caverns sits on that they plan to open up to camping in the future. Just thought I’d let all the sad Tribe fans like myself who missed their shows this year that there’s hope for the future! $212.50 Rave Spell ticket  NOT  able to be separated Ticket was purchased with DICE app for Bandcamp presale, so I can transfer via DICE Venmo or PayPal friends and family Proof:  https://imgur.com/ukFkhwI title 3.1k sectornauts 2 here and now Jul 6, 2010 Cake Day
