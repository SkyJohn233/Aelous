Erotica | PoemShape Patrick Gillespie  has self-published one book of Poetry and edited nothing besides. His poetry and criticism has been firmly ignored and hasn't been translated into a single language. Gillespie has never been a  Poet Laureate  (let alone a  Poet Laureate of the Blogosphere ), a  Literary Fellow of the National Endowment of the Arts , or a  Fellow of the Vermont Arts Council . He has received no prizes from the  Poetry Foundation  (or any other poetry related organizations) and the devil reportedly worries that Hell will freeze over if he ever receives anything like a  Genius Grant  from the  MacArthur Fellows Program . He has been firmly rejected by any and all publishers. No plaques have been or will be dedicated to him or his poetry. Gillespie has received no recognition or prizes of any kind. He holds zero academic credentials or titles. In short, Gillespie is just like you -- of little to no importance to all but a few. You have no reason whatsoever to read him. He wears bottle-cap glasses, works as a Carpenter, has three daughters and a good sense of humor. He is currently replacing all the bad windows in his Vermont home.
