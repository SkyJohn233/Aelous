6 best crossfire and sli graphics cards on test page 4 techradar by jeremy laird pcformat issue 228 july 25 2009 multi-gpu set-ups from 160 to 860 can you have too much of a good thing that 's the first question that leaps to mind in the context of these ridiculous dual-card quad-gpu graphics solutions well that and the one about your sanity for even considering such wanton decadence for starters the raw specifications of both the ati radeon 4870 x2 crossfirex and nvidia 's competing geforce gtx 295 sli are almost too much to comprehend in no particular order the edited highlights include a grand total of nearly 8gb of graphics memory shared between all four cards getting on for a terabyte per second of memory bandwidth and 2,560 stream shader cores madness then there 's more madness the cost you wo n't get much change out of 700 for a pair of radeon hd 4870 x2 boards hard to believe but the geforce gtx 295 duo is even worse at slightly under 900 unless you 're a westminster mp bagging goodies on the tax payer 's ticket that 's pretty hard to swallow these cards are monstrous physical specimens too immensely long and enormously heavy ultimately the very concept of cost has to be excluded from the equation if the 4870 x2 crossfirex and geforce gtx 295 sli are to make any sense at all for that matter given how much power these beastly boards consume you 'd better not give much thought to the livelihood of birds bees and lovely old trees either with four high-end gpus in your pc and you 'll be looking at a system that guzzles around 700 watts and that does n't even include a monitor or speakers with current concerns regarding the environment in mind that 's probably downright immoral and yet at the same time the mad scientist in us ca n't quite resist the lure of the most powerful graphics solutions available to humanity who would n't cackle with delight and cry out it 's alive as four monster gpus spool up okay maybe it 's just us the problem is the laughter quickly turns to tears when you inspect the benchmark results but before we come to the detailed performance analysis let 's remind ourselves what makes these beasties tick the ati radeon hd 4870 x2 has been around for some time and is based on a pair of amd 's enormously successful rv770 gpus key specs include 1,600 stream shaders per card a core clockspeed of 750mhz and 1gb of gddr5 memory running at an effective rate of 3.6ghz in total each board packs nearly two billion gpu transistors and a theoretical maximum computational capability of 2.6 tflops no compromises needless to say you can double most of those figures for a pair of 4870 x2s running in quad-gpu crossfirex mode but perhaps the best thing about the 4870 x2 is that it brings with it absolutely no compromises compared with the single-gpu card upon which it is based it has the same clockspeeds and memory buffer as the radeon hd 4870 that means that when crossfire mode does n't work you can at least be confident of getting the best single-gpu performance that amd can offer or at least that used to be the case until amd released the slightly upgraded radeon hd 4890 so it goes as for the geforce gtx 295 it follows a slightly more typical path for a multi-gpu graphics card in that some compromises have been made it 's based on nvidia 's epic 1.4 billion-transistor gt200 gpu but such is the heinous power hungriness of that chip nvidia had to give it a bit of a chop here and there mercifully that does n't include the shader array all 240 units are present and enabled in both gpus which translates into 480 per card and 960 in quad-gpu sli configuration likewise all 80 texture units make an appearance take a peek at the clockspeeds however and you begin to see where nvidia has cut corners both the core clockspeed of 576mhz and the shader clock of 1,242mhz are well down on those of the fastest single-gpu gt200 board the geforce gtx 285 what 's more nvidia has taken the knife to gt200 's render outputs reducing the number from 32 to 28 per gpu core that in turn has a knock-on effect on the memory bus and frame buffer the former shrinks from 512-bit to 448-bit while the latter drops from 1gb to 896mb again per gpu all of which means that in the unfortunate event that multi-gpu scaling fails to work systems based on both the radeon hd 4870 x2 crossfirex and the geforce gtx 295 sli will fail to match the performance of their closest single-gpu relatives that 's a sobering thought when you think about how much a pair of these cards cost the good news is that in our benchmarks there 's no evidence of either crossfirex or sli failing to provide at least some multi-gpu scaling both are significantly faster across the board than the best single-gpu cards currently on the market however when you factor in the competition from the fastest dual-card solutions a pair of radeon hd 4890s from amd or two nvidia geforce gtx 285s the wheels begin to come off in the case of the nvidia comparison the quad-gpu setup delivers very little extra performance in world of conflict and is actually significantly slower in far cry 2 even if it does take an easy victory in crysis warhead at the enthusiastcentric 2,560 x 1,600 resolution in the amd camp forking out for quad-gpu kit will buy you moderate performance gains in the region of 20 to 25 per cent in far cry 2 and world of conflict but you 'll have to swallow a performance penalty of a similar magnitude in crysis warhead is quad-gpu therefore a step too far we think so current page high-end gpu
