questions about common damage and repairs seen in old violins the pegbox maestronet forums forgot your password by georgeh february 6 2017 in the pegbox first i was wondering why many old violins show dents and surface damage under the strings in back of the bridge and in front of the end of the fingerboard it seems to me to that this would be one area that would be protected against bangs and bumps is it from bridges bending and ultimately snapping anything else second why do so many old violins have button repairs in the back besides an impact to the neck what else causes a button to break-off like that are you talking about replaced buttons or ebony collars on buttons some damage and dents in back of the bridge that i have seen are from fine tuners in the tailpiece that is too low or that had been carelessly allowed to flop around when strings were removed are you talking about replaced buttons or ebony collars on buttons i mean buttons that are broken off entirely as if the neck was snapped off sometimes they are replaced or the original one is restored ome damage and dents in back of the bridge that i have seen are from fine tuners in the tailpiece that is too low or that had been carelessly allowed to flop around when strings were removed i am thinking about the damage often seen on the other side of the bridge do you have a photo i mean buttons that are broken off entirely as if the neck was snapped off sometimes they are replaced or the original one is restored i am thinking about the damage often seen on the other side of the bridge often i 've never seen something like that the button has a constructional weak connection a sollbruchstelle to the back due to the purfling grove but is stressed in many regards shrinkage of back neck root or ribs removal from the neck or block for repair or neck reset/grafting a long leverage from the neck etc. so there 's no wonder if it 's cracked off very often dents or marks before the bridge can be caused by unedequate cleaning methods to remove rosin fingernails for instance do you have a photo here two examples i wonder where they come from seems like more than poor cleaning methods but maybe people are rougher with their instruments than i can imagine the button has a constructional weak connection a sollbruchstelle to the back due to the purfling grove but is stressed in many regards shrinkage of back neck root or ribs removal from the neck or block for repair or neck reset/grafting a long leverage from the neck etc. so there 's no wonder if it 's cracked off very often that all makes sense thanks do luthiers usually glue the button to the neck do luthiers usually glue the button to the neck not usually always not usually always maybe not always a friend of mine had the neck of her violin pull off due to the violin becoming overheated in the case left in sun the button was fine and did not appear to have been glued to the neck which is one reason that i asked about this it was a fine modern violin made by a contemporary maker not a factory instrument so i was wondering if the button was not glued to the neck as a way to keep buttons from breaking off if the neck is otherwise snapped some of it 's due to moving the bridge up or down on the violin sometimes i 've seen a rather large span of distance relatively speaking in bridge placement over the life of a fiddle good photos george but this chewed up surface i have not seen before perhaps very thick rosin dirt over the ages some of which ate into the wood and eventually cleaned out by too vigorously cleaning or years of moving the bridge in various places from rough spots to smoother spots a friend of mine had the neck of her violin pull off due to the violin becoming overheated in the case left in sun the button was fine and did not appear to have been glued to the neck which is one reason that i asked about this probably an indication of the glue on both the neck joint and the button being too weak or some kind of alternate type hot glue wo n't normally release with heat alone think the button issue has been covered re the deterioration of the table around the bridge i agree that it 's to do with the build-up of rosin and subsequent weakening of the varnish and or wood i wonder if large rosin deposits are n't a bit of a moisture trap here two examples i wonder where they come from seems like more than poor cleaning methods but maybe people are rougher with their instruments than i can imagine complete shot in the dark but i wonder if some might not be bow scratches and some might not be due to the bridge slipping feet forward as it 's being pulled back just my two cents my guess fingernail marks from straightening the bridge cheers mat could be rosin sitting on it for years it is corrosive enough to corrode metal on bow frogs so it ca n't be good for varnish some might not be due to the bridge slipping feet forward as it 's being pulled back i was also thinking a bridge break or slip during adjustment because these indentations often look like impact marks probably an indication of the glue on both the neck joint and the button being too weak or some kind of alternate type hot glue wo n't normally release with heat alone i was thinking that thermal expansion of the wood might have applied enough mechanical force to break the glue bond but you may be right about weak glue nevertheless there was not any glue on the button or the base of the neck maybe that was a contributing factor to both the neck coming loose and the button not being pulled off david have you ever heard of not glueing the neck to the button the fingerboard did put some nasty marks in the top but did not crack it fortunately and surprisingly none of the bouts sprang lose or seams opened we had one customer who had left some pretty deep fingernail gouges and marks from the bridge feet from obsessively moving the bridge almost every time he played looking for the best sound similar to what mat mentioned i have also seen a person or two who would store the bow by inserting it under the strings when the fiddle was laying flat or hanging on a wall sounds strange but you still get a few people who will do odd things like hanging a violin from the music stand during breaks david have you ever heard of not glueing the neck to the button no i have n't but it does n't mean that someone could n't have tried it correction i 've seen it on necks which were meant to be removed for transport and on some necks which were meant to be adjustable via some mechanism mostly on basses but on these i think is was more common to have the button attached to the neck and not integrated with the back sounds strange but you still get a few people who will do odd things like hanging a violin from the music stand during breaks more than just a few still lol you can post now and register later.if you have an account sign in now to post with your account note your post will
