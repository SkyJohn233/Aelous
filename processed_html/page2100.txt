Why Can ' t I view someone ' s profile anymore on Facebook? | Yahoo Answers I was viewing someones profile on facebook within my network. They next day the persons profile is not viewable. Once it let me click on it, although now it won &# x27;t let me. Does she know that i am viewing her profile through a tracker? We are not friends on the network. there is no program that i know of that can track that information. this person probably just switched her privacy settings so that only her friends can view her profile. View Facebook Profile no she cannot know that u viewed her profile... maybe she enabled the privacy protection about viewing the profile (makes only Friends who can view it)! Hi hunn.  She &# x27;s either deleted her account, or she &# x27;s blocked you from her allow list, therefore you will no longer be apart of her network. I hope I helped! Jordyn.xo
