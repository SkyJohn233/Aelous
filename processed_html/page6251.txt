Push_back variadic function parameters into a vector? - Stack Overflow                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 I am trying to push_back the parameters of a variadic function as shown below, but the compiler says there is a type mismatch (due to the parameters being a general type while the vector is int). What should I do to make the parameters compatible? In C++14 and before: In C++17: Start with a base case: Continue with 'gradual unpacking' Not as compact, but a little easier to grok.
