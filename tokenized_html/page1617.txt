a case study of the body shop design in an automotive factory using 3d simulation international journal of production research vol 44 no 18-19 there are five major shops in an automotive factory namely press shop body shop power train shop paint shop and trim shop general assembly shop when an automotive factory develops a new car model new production lines should be constructed at the same time and the body shop especially needs to be entirely rebuilt whenever a new car model is developed the body shop is a typical example of the flow shop or transfer line many parts are assembled together in the body shop by various welding operations therefore the cycle time of each robot and the buffer size between two sub-lines should be determined in the design phase of the body shop this paper explains a case study of a body shop design using 3d simulation in a korean automotive factory 3d simulation is useful in verifying if the factory design would meet the production quantity target it also helps in understanding the structure of the factory quest® igrip® and factory-cad® are used for the 3d simulation model automotive manufacturing is a complex task with several automated functions machined or purchased components are assembled on sub-systems and the sub-assemblies are assembled during the final assembly system there are usually five major shops in an automotive factory such as the press shop stamping shop body shop power train shop paint shop and trim shop the trim shop is usually called the general assembly shop there are two important storages in the factory namely the white body storage wbs and the painted body storage pbs the wbs is located between the body shop and the paint shop and the pbs is located between the paint shop and the trim shop figure 1 shows the five shops two storages and the production flow of car manufacturing figure 1 five shops and two storages in the automotive factory figure 1 five shops and two storages in the automotive factory when an automotive company develops a new car model new production lines are to be built in case a fully new model is developed the layout of the body shop power train shop and trim shop needs to be entirely rebuilt however even though a minor changed model face lift is developed the changes in the body shop are relatively more complex than in the other shops thus the optimal design of the body shop is an important aspect of the factory the body shop is a typical example of the flow shop or transfer line many parts are assembled together in the body shop by various welding operations generally the body shop is divided into 15 ∼ 20 sub-assembly lines as shown in figure 2 each sub-line represents a welding area covering numerous welding operations in different stations of course one or more sub-lines can be outsourced in order to improve the performance of the factory the decoupled sub-lines are connected with the power-and-free conveyor or with the electric monorail system ems the function of the conveyor or ems is the transportation of the sub-assembly to the next sub-line and also the preparation of buffer space preparing for any unexpected breakdowns of the two consecutive sub-lines figure 2 general structure of a body shop figure 2 general structure of a body shop years ago when designers were in the early stages of manufacturing design sample sketches of manufacturing process were made based on the common industry 's rule of thumb these designs were often accepted and put into production as time passed this rule of thumb fell short of the manufacturer 's needs which were quality reliability complexity and increased diversified customer demand it was at this point that the manufacturing industry began to look more closely at discrete event simulation as a tool to help design manufacturing systems for the future ulgen et al 1994 ulgen o gunal a grajo e and shore j 1994 the role of simulation in design and operation of body and paint shops in vehicle assembly plants in proceedings of the european simulation symposium society of computer simulation international 124 – 128 google scholar discussed the use of discrete-event simulation in the design and operation of body and paint shops in north american vehicle assembly plants they classified the use of simulation in the body shop into two aspects the first classification is based on the stage of system development which has four categories namely the conceptual design phase the detailed design phase the launching phase and the fully operational phase the second classification is based on the nature of the problem investigated which also includes four categories such as equipment and layout design issues issues related to variation management product-mix sequencing issues and other operational issues recently with the development of computer technology virtual manufacturing vm technology is rapidly applied to manufacturing system design vm is a key concept that summarizes computerized manufacturing activities dealing with models and simulations instead of objects and their operations in the real world the application areas of vm in the manufacturing industry are the design of the product the design of the equipment the design of the jigs and tools the layout design of the factory the material handling system design the strategy of the production schedule and so on indeed many research areas deal with vm recently vm is implemented in the ergonomic design of workstations ben-gal and bukchin 2002 ben-gal i and bukchin j 2002 the

manufacturing system model the proposed model consists of four types of modules such as the virtual device module the transfer handler module the state manager module and the flow controller module figure 3 shows the components necessary for implementing the vm and their relationship with the body shop design the two important functions of vm are the 3d modelling and the simulation involving the mechanical verification in particular this paper focuses on the simulation which is composed of the work cell simulation and the system simulation in the 3d work cell simulation the detailed motion of each robot is optimized and the collisions among parts jigs and robots are checked the time necessary for robot teaching becomes shorter with offline programming olp technology in system simulation the traditional optimization of the factory layout design is conducted including the determination of cycle time buffer size material handling equipment and so on the tool supporting 3d factory cad®

suggested in this paper a case study on the 3d simulation of the body shop design in a korean automotive factory is explained 3d simulation is a very useful tool for verifying the factory design to meet the production quantity target and also for understanding the system configurations of the factory quest® igrip® and factory cad® were used for developing the 3d system simulation model the procedure of the body shop design is explained and the improvement of the initial layout is introduced in the conceptual phase of the body shop design it is not enough to obtain the information used for the design of the factory the drawings of the new car the production rate target and the available space are likewise given to engineers figure 4 shows the typical process flow of the body shop design figure 4 flow of the design approach for body shop figure 4 flow of the design approach for body shop in most automotive industries the production rate target is usually represented as job per hour jph jph means the number of cars produced per hour assume that the target is set as 50 jph and that the available working time of one shift 10 h with a 20 min break is 580 min then the takt time is calculated as 580 × 60 50 × 10 70 s. the cycle time of each sub-line is determined with this target in this step the engineers should know the downtime rate of the sub-line the estimated downtime rate of the sub-line is used in this step because the number of stations and the equipment have not yet been determined the downtime rate is usually determined from a similar production line if the estimated rate is 10 the cycle time is set as 70 × 0.9 63 s. this value means that all operations in the line should be finished within 63 s including the transportation time to the next station this estimation may be the main reason for inaccuracy in the initial design it means that there is always a difference between the downtime rate of similar line and that of the new line because new equipment and technology are introduced to the new line although the downtime data obtained from similar lines or processes are used for simulation there is always some mismatch between the results of simulation and that of the real line after starting mass production therefore most engineers want to overestimate the downtime rate because they are aware of insufficient capacity and this results in an over-investment for equipment and workers next the number of stations installed in the sub-line is determined and the welding points are distributed to each station figure 5 shows an example of the process time design of the rear under-body line the cycle time of each station is the sum of transfer time and pure cycle time in this step the type of robot and the material handling system in the sub-line is considered the initial layout of the sub-line is determined following the design processes mentioned above a work cell simulation is carried out in this stage and the simulation results serve as the guide for the design modification figure 5 example of process time chart of rear under-body line figure 5 example of process time chart of rear under-body line after preparing the initial designs of all sub-lines the system simulation of the body shop starts in this stage most robots and the type of material handling equipment connecting two sub-lines are already determined the functions of material handling equipment are transportation and storage space power-and-free conveyor or ems is usually selected for the system figure 6 shows the 3d simulation model using igrip® and the robot picks up the side body to hang it on the ems thus the total amount of hanger or ems and the optimal allocation policy should be determined with the system simulation the major interests in the system simulation are whether the body shop achieves its production quantity target jph or not and the search for the best layout figure 6 simulation model of a loading robot using igrip® figure 6 simulation model of a loading robot using igrip® the body shop considered in this paper consists of 16 sub-lines the sub-assembly of the roof is determined as an outsourcing item there are four to 16 stations and two to 20 robots are installed in each sub-line accordingly however there is no robot in the biw body in white line and the biw install line there are two types of material-handling equipment for connecting the two consecutive sub-lines the first type is through the auto-loader that is installed between the sub-lines of opening parts and the biw line note that there are six opening parts with four types of doors hood and tailgate the second type is through the ems which is installed between other sub-lines the numbers of ems in each buffer are one to 13 respectively the production rate target is 50 jph and 580 min is the actual working time during a shift 10 h including 2 h of overtime thus the takt time of the shop is determined as 70 s. the downtime rates of the sub-lines at the initial design stage are estimated to be 10∼20 the cycle times of all sub-lines are determined in the range of 48–63 s. these values are used for determining the number of stations and number of robots the robot elevator and various types of conveyor or shuttle are the main equipment in the body shop thus the downtime analysis of the robot is important for the design of the body shop however it is not easy to estimate the downtime rate of a robot when the robot is a new product thus the estimation is carried out by analysing the existing robots which conduct similar operations the causes of the breakdown of the system can be divided into two categories namely independent and dependent reasons the failure of the machine and the changing of cables for example are included in the independent category the second category means that the robot can be stopped for other reasons examples of these are the downtime caused by the starvation and the blocking at the second criterion thus this is mainly due to the failure of another machine or the imbalance between the sub-lines table 1 shows the grouping of failures for investigating the distribution of the mtbf mean time between failures and mttr mean time to repair when design engineers determine the cycle time of a sub-line for the initial layout both categories of downtimes are usually included in the estimation of downtime rate however the starvation and the blocking need not be investigated because their values can be obtained from the results of the simulation experiments the real downtime data of the past year are gathered from the existing body shop and the distributions of mtbf and mttr are obtained with the input analyser of arena® contrary to the use of mttf mean time to failure in arena® two options are possible for the input of failure in quest® one is after repair and the other is before repair after repair indicates that the subsequent failure of the current failure is to be scheduled after the repair specified in the current failure is completed thus this means the same with mttf on the other hand before repair indicates that the subsequent failure of the current failure is to be scheduled based on failure distribution without taking the repair time into consideration thus this means the same with mtbf after obtaining the distribution function of failure from the input analyser of arena® the distribution function is put into quest® with the option of before repair to obtain the distribution function of mtbf using the arena® the original failure data failure history were modified considering the working calendar of the past year for example we deleted the holidays and off-times from the calculation of the inter-failure time figure 7 shows an example of the distribution analysis of mtbf the input analyser of arena® provides three kinds of information on the distribution function squared error result of the chi-square test result of the kolmogorov–smirnov test figure 7 distribution analysis of mtbf of failure in the main body line figure 7 distribution analysis of mtbf of failure in the main body line the chi-square test c-s test is the oldest goodness-fit hypothesis test which is thought of as a more formal comparison of a histogram with the fitted density or mass function it is identified that a real difficulty in using the c-s test in the continuous case is deciding on the number of intervals law and kelton 2000 law am and kelton wd 2000 simulation modeling and analysis 3rd singapore mcgraw-hill google scholar in the input analyser of arena® the number of the intervals for the histogram can be varied from five to 40 we decreased the number of intervals from the largest value one by one and concluded that the distribution function provided automatically from the input analyser was useful the kolmogorov–smirnov test k–s test for goodness of fit on the other hand compares an empirical distribution function with the distribution function of the hypothesized distribution the k–s test does not require us to group the data in any way so no information is lost this also eliminates the troublesome problem of interval specification another advantage of the k–s test is that it is valid for any sample size n whereas the chi-square test is valid only in an asymptotic sense law and kelton 2000 law am and kelton wd 2000 simulation modeling and analysis 3rd singapore mcgraw-hill google scholar table 2 shows the results of distribution fitting for the mtbf and mttr of the main body line using the input analyser of arena® it is known that if n is very large these tests will almost always reject the null hypothesis law and kelton 2000 law am and kelton wd 2000 simulation modeling and analysis 3rd singapore mcgraw-hill google scholar all distributions provided in arena® 's input analyser could not be accepted except for the mtbf with a log-normal distribution the p -value of the k–s test for the log-normal distribution was greater than 0.15 because the number of downtime data points gathered in the main body line was 1117 thus we selected the type of distribution with the minimum squared error if there were no critical differences between the pattern of histogram and the shape of distribution in the same way the distribution as is the case in figure 7 of each line was determined the downtime data of all lines were obtained from the department of facilities maintenance additionally other downtime data of the main body line were also obtained from the production line we compared the two data of the main body line and found that there were differences between the two data the downtime rate of the second data was 2.54 times higher than the rate of the first data we analysed the reason and found that some failures were repaired by the worker of the line not by the repair man from the maintenance department thus such failures were omitted from the first data unfortunately there were no downtime data which were gathered by the production lines not by the maintenance department except for the main body line to investigate the effect of the difference of downtime rate a brief simulation model of the body shop that had produced existing old cars was developed and the production quantity was obtained during the past year the result of the simulation was compared with the real production quantity for the year the comparison indicated that the real production quantity was 5 less than the simulation result we concluded that this was due to the accuracy of the historical data of downtimes as a result we aimed to decrease the mean of mtbf the increase in repair time did not need to be considered because this was the problem of downtime frequency although this approach could cause a new distortion in a statistical aspect it was an easy and fast way to solve the problem considering the limited project period the distribution functions of mtbf were modified as shown in table 3 and a new simulation run was conducted then the production quantities of the simulation converged to the real data therefore the new downtime distribution functions in table 3 were used for the input data of the new body shop table 3 presents the distributions of mtbf and mttr of the equipment failure for the major sub-lines the 3d simulation model has been developed with quest® igrip® and factory-cad® in particular igrip® was used for the work cell simulation model figure 2 the kinematics for a robot was developed and the cycle time in each station was estimated at this stage the igrip® model can be transformed easily to the quest® model with a few steps because both tools are developed by the same company dassault-delmia at first an igrip® model should be saved with a questcell file next the questcell file device file and part file are copied to the relative folders of quest® when a machine is generated in quest® the questcell file is selected for the kin data in the display menu after selecting key in the same name of the questcell file that has been saved in igrip® to the name of kin data in quest® then the sequence chart of igrip® in which the motions of robot are defined is inherited to the kinematics in quest® if there are too many igrip® models in quest® then the simulation speed decreases because the file size of the quest model becomes large when two or more products are welded by a robot and the moving path of the robot is different more complex steps are necessary to show the animation safety fences mezzanines columns and other accessories in the factory were modelled with factory-cad® the accessory models were transformed with vrml format and integrated in the system simulation model figure 8 shows the process of integrating the 3d model figure 8 example of the integration of the tools a accessory modelling using factory-cad® b robot modelling using igrip® c integrated model using quest® figure 8 example of the integration of the tools a accessory modelling using factory-cad® b robot modelling using igrip® c integrated model using quest® the body shop is composed of many sub-lines and each sub-line has the characteristics of a transfer line as follows all parts in a sub-line are transferred at the same time to the next station by a shuttle if one of the robots in a sub-line fails the whole sub-line stops until the robot is repaired there are one or more robots in a station and their process times are different from each other thus after all robots in a station finish their operations that part of the station may already be transferred figure 9 flow chart of the control logic figure 9 flow chart of the control logic the first experiment was carried out to investigate the performance of the initial layout of the body shop the simulation period was 6 months and the mean value of five replications was obtained the warm-up period was set to 7 days although the target throughput production quantity for 6 months was 97 500 cars the average value obtained from the simulation was only 90 000 thus the production performance is 92.2 the purpose of the next experiments was to find out which factor was most influential for system performance various sensitivity analyses indicated that the buffers connecting the six sub-lines of the opening parts to the biw line were very sensitive to the performance measure thus the buffer size was increased to 2 6 and 10 respectively table 4 shows the results of an additional simulation based on this it was found that the buffer size should be at least 10 however it was impossible to equip 10 buffers because of space constraints therefore the buffer size was fixed at six for all opening part sub-lines another interest is the possibility of reducing the number of ems because the cost of ems is about us 30 000 per unit consequently a new sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the less effective buffer among the eight inter-sub-lines the buffer size of six opening parts sub-lines was fixed at six considering the result of the previous experiment the gradient search method was also applied to this experiment the weakness of the 3d simulation is that it takes a long time to run thus a simplified simulation model to be used for evaluating the effect of ems was developed one ems was removed from each conveyor and the conveyor that had the least effect on performance measure was selected similarly the number of ems was decreased gradually and alternative 3 was selected as the final design table 5 shows the result of the 10 replications for the four selective alternatives among numerous iterations the value in the cell of table 3 is the number of ems for the confidentiality of the factory we denote the number of ems in the sub-line of the initial layout as n i and the total number as n ten ems were reduced and the saving of investment cost was estimated at about us 300 000 on the contrary the production quantity was decreased to about 0.3 from the original design table 6 shows the p -value of the t -test for the difference of mean between alternatives it is clear that the throughputs of a1 a2 a3 and a4 are less than the throughput of the initial alternative the throughput of a3 is better than the throughputs of a1 a2 and a4 and there is no difference in throughput among a1 a2 and a4 the allocation data of ems in alternative 3 were put into the full simulation model again the throughput of the initial model 96 580 is different from the throughput in table 2 95 795 because the data in table 3 were obtained with simplified simulation model and the number of replications is different thus alternative 3 in table 3 was applied to the full model the average throughput production quantity of the full model was 95 584 during the 6-month period and the decreasing rate from the original throughput 95 795 cars was 0.3 table 4 the decreasing rate in the full model was the same as the decreasing rate in the simplified model when an automotive company develops a new car model a company has to build new production lines the body shop in its task is the centre of the new design process constructing a new body shop involves a substantial amount of investment because it requires a large number of robots and material-handling equipment hence a simulation has been widely used from the conceptual design phases in this paper a case study of a korean automotive factory was introduced the general structure of a body shop was explained and the workflow of the body shop was summarized 3d simulation models were developed with quest® igrip® and factory-cad® for enhancing the understanding of the body shop igrip® is used for developing the 3d simulation model of a work cell for mechanical simulation and quest® and factory-cad® are used for developing whole-system simulation models the simulation experiments indicated that the initial layout could not achieve the production quantity target thus the increase in buffer size of the opening part sub-lines was suggested another improvement made was the reduction in the number of ems without decreasing the production quantity as such 10 ems were removed leading to cost savings of us 300 000 the body shop considered in this paper is now in operation and the new cars are being manufactured we tried additional simulation runs using real downtime data obtained from the past 3 months as a result it was verified that the body shop could achieve its production target of 50 jph this is due to the fact that the practical downtime rate is lower than the estimated value because the quality of the new robots is improved the authors appreciate the anonymous referees for their valuable comments the
