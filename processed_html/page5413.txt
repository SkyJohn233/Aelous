You can now see if you’re loading properly into League of Legends games - The Rift Herald clock menu more-arrow no yes poly-lt-wire-logo Follow The Rift Herald on Twitter Follow The Rift Herald on Facebook Search poly-lt-wire-logo Filed under: You won’t be asking yourself “Am I still loading or did my game crash?” ever again! After being added to the public beta environment last week, the small spinning circle indicator has been added to the live game with patch 6.21.  The little circle shows up at the bottom right of your screen and spins as you load in. If your game freezes, the circle should stop moving.  look at it go  #PBE pic.twitter.com/SyvDHElcod It’s pretty small, but this is something players have been asking for. In the past, players were able to see their loading process as a bar, but it was later changed to the simple percentage we have now.  The problem is that games still crash when the percentage hits 100, so people can’t tell if their game crashed or if somebody else’s did. So now we’ll be able to tell if we own the toaster or if we can blame somebody else! This is one of the changes that Riot has released in their long line of player-requested game improvements. Other upcoming features include the  replay system , the  Practice Tool  (which is kind of a sandbox mode) and Twitch’s  ultimate name change .  poly-lt-wire-logo Vox Media
