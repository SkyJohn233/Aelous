HYPNOTHERAPY  &  NLP - Mind MechanicsMind Mechanics Trained hypnotherapists use deep relaxation exercises to obtain an altered state of consciousness, assisting in releasing memories and barriers within the subconscious. That is why this type of therapy is used to help individuals overcome persistent or long-standing issues, as blockages are removed from deep within the subconscious. Many healing professionals use hypnotherapy as part of their healing sessions and strategies including counsellors, psychologists and many other types of therapists. It is important to note that several hypnotherapy sessions may be required in order for the individual to overcome the issues at hand. There are several benefits of hypnotherapy. Hypnotherapy can be used to help: In my practice,  Clinical Hypnosis and Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP)  are the major tools I use to move people forward from feelings that give behaviours such as performance anxiety, trauma and illness, fears and phobias, depression and so much more. Humans are complicated beings where the same or similar behaviours in one person can create completely different feelings and outcomes in another. As a practitioner employing the tools of Clinical Hypnosis and NLP Psychotherapy, I allow the client to show me how I can facilitate their healing, as we move over the hurdle of a normal waking or sleeping state into the hypnotic state where as a hypnotic operator I can work equally with the mind and the body as a whole unit. You must experience it yourself to know the feeling of this pleasant dreaming state where when awakened, you feel refreshed and ready to move on with new resolve. judi@mindmechanics.com.au 02 9970 8880 0419 019 842 Mind Mechanics Complementary Health Centre 12 Amaroo Ave, Elanora Heights NSW 2101
