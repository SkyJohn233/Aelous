A little Endless Eight discussion : anime Warning: If you haven &# x27;t seen  " The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya " , there will be spoiler! " The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya "  and the disappearance movie are two of my absolute favorite peaces of anime which left me with a very strong void but there is also a controversial part of the Haruhi franchise. The  " Endless Eight "  arc. Is there anyone out there how really likes it like I do? Why I like it: After a few episodes you know exactly what is going to happen and you don &# x27;t have to read the subtitles (if you watched in subbed) anymore. At this point you see everything exactly like Yuki Nagato does. In my opinion the atmosphere and the feeling of melancholy while you see the characters having fun during these episodes is just fantastic. And in addition it is important to keep endless eight in mind when you are watching the disappearance movie. I love it because it &# x27;s hilarious how mad people get about it. I absolutely hated it because I didn &# x27;t know it was gonna happen. So I just watched every single episode thinking  " it &# x27;s gonna be different this time "  and got annoyed every single time. Kyon-kun, denwa! I liked it, since it made the movie more enjoyable, and its still a 10/10 But if you don &# x27;t watch endless eight, you &# x27;ll miss the time Haruhi wears her hair up. I had no idea about the endless eight while watching Haruhi, I just went and watched the whole thing expecting that Kyon would slowly start  " seeing the future "  and freak out some people, sadly it didn &# x27;t happen like this...Still, I don &# x27;t regret watching it, I think that it was something really different and I wanted to have experienced this while the anime was airing, staying 2 months in a  " loop "  of the same episode might have pissed many people yet my opinion wouldn &# x27;t have changed, it may be terrible writing or whatever, but I honestly think it was a really interesting idea. Yes I watched it with my friend and by the third one we were trying to finish all the characters &# x27; sentences. Just from memory, stuff like: " Now I see why they call it a public swimming pool " " What about our pay? That &# x27;s it. Huh? " " Mikuru looked so darn cute in it " " You can have one, but only one, k? " " Goldfish scooping it is " " Can I take a look at that? " " Penalty! " " And money! Bring lots of money! " " Can &# x27;t she see the no diving signs? " " But can we catch just any kind of bug? " " That stuff &# x27;s totally easy. " " It &# x27;s mikuru &# x27;s only request " " These guys are my brigade members. They do what I say, so if you want something, you can ask them " And knowing the story made it easier to focus on stuff like the outfit changes, and the subtle rearrangements of phrasing. Stuff like   and   really rewarded watching through everything. And I thought the resolution was very satisfying. I could definitely relate to Haruhi in that moment. I appreciated it because it showed time loops in a way no other show had. I hated it because I can &# x27;t bear skipping episodes. I knew what was happening, and let it happen anyways. I went in without any preparation. I watched episode 2 with this strange feeling of deja vu -  &# x27;Isn &# x27;t this pretty similar to episode 1? &# x27; and was about to close the video thinking that I might be watching episode 1 by accident when the cast discovered the time loop.  &# x27;So that &# x27;s why it seems so familiar! &# x27; And I went on to episode 3, expecting Kyon to figure out the solution and break out of the loop. And then episode 4. And then episode 5... and so on. Each time I watched the episodes tediously. There was a weird sense of tedium and frustration but I still kept watching. It was a strange experience for me. I &# x27;ve never watched/experienced a time loop being portrayed this way. This weariness that I felt was different from that experienced when watching something with shallow characters and a terrible plot. And so, I watched on and on. By the end of the last episode, the relief felt was definitely one that would not be experienced if the arc ended at episode 3. Sure, the solution was nothing incredibly ingenious. But it really brings to the point how lost and clueless the whole cast is. To them, everything they &# x27;re doing is something new. They have no way of knowing that they &# x27;re doing exactly the same thing they did the previous loops. Only when the final deja vu hits Kyon does he understand that this is truly his last chance before everything loops again. And as each feeling of deja vu builds up over the loops, he starts to finally receive the intuition he needs to do something that would actually break the loop. All in all, it was an incredible experience. It might not be a pleasant one, but it is still a really refreshing experience that really delivers the monotony and frustration of time loops. I read the novel and manga after finishing the movie, and I can honestly admit that both mediums don &# x27;t give me as much emotional impact as the anime did. Both novel and manga delivered the interesting story and idea well, but the parts on deja vu and the immense number of loops Yuki experienced were just perused without a second glance. If I hadn &# x27;t seen the Endless Eight episodes, this arc would just be another interesting story about time loops. So... great job KyoAni. I really appreciated the trolling I got. Now I understand even better than Kyon himself when he says  &# x27;I hope we won &# x27;t experience something like that endless summer again. &# x27; because I sure as hell wouldn &# x27;t want to watch anything like this a second time! I liked it but they could have used those 8 episodes to do something better. On the other hand, because of those 8 episodes they made my favorite movie of all time. The real problem for me is  " The Sight of Haruhi Suzumiya "  arc, in which she behaves like a total bitch, I was fine with what she did before but that was just to much. For me the first season was an absolute 10/10 while the second season was just an 8/10. Wow, so I &# x27;m not the only one how thinks  " The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya "  was more or less the worst arc? An EIGHT out of ten for the season with Endless EIGHT? Was that intentional? The arc should &# x27;ve been 4 eps max. It works as a concept, but the payoff was not worth it. inFinite Four? Doesn &# x27;t work quite as well. I loved it because of how frustrated it made me. I &# x27;d watch an episode after work each day, I &# x27;m certain I watched a few twice, I loved it because the relief at the end was so palpable it made the entire thing worth it and then it was just a week or so until I saw the movie I didn &# x27;t mind it at all, although I had feels when it was airing, expecting something different each week only to get 8 very similar episodes. It was definitely experimental, and by the end of the 8 episodes, I couldn &# x27;t even be mad anymore. Honestly it takes a really dedicated Haruhi fan to appreciate something like this and I have to say at the time I was fanboy enough to think that wow, I got trolled but I can &# x27;t even be mad. At first i thought: why am i watching the exact same shit again? I thought where I watched the anime messed up and changed every episode to the first episode of endless eight. After I found the same shit happening on other places i skipped episodes until i finally got out of the cycle and I still did not understand it, so I watched the episodes and thought: wtf anime wtf are you doing to me. Afterwards I did not like or hate it. I just thought: well that was something new.. Since I expected the Endless Eight, I tackled it a little differently... only about 2 episodes a day or so. I even had it just playing in the background as I did other things nearby. But in the end, I enjoyed watching it. Even though I knew it would be the same every time, it somehow  felt  different. The differences in art, music, delivery... they were all slight and yet held a power all their own. I will admit that the 8 episode length was pushing it... especially with such a poor conclusion... but I think it was fascinating. And I appreciate the effort that went into creating each  " unique "  episode. The art was amazing. And the slight differences were worth catching. I &# x27;d feel like I missed something if I didn &# x27;t watch them all! I like the idea and all, but the fact that it ate up 2/3rd &# x27;s of the season makes me kinda salty. Also come on, people, no one needs to sit through all the 8 episodes to realize that it might &# x27;ve been a bit annoying of an experience for Nagato... I skipped 5 of the episodes. Actually, now that I think about it, I may have skipped 6 of them... 1.3m competitive karuta fans 9.5k studying the Hyakunin Isshu Jan 25, 2008 Cake Day
