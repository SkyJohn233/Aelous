Reid, Ivana Sunjevaric,  [...],  and Rodney Rothstein Additional article information We have created a resource to rapidly map genetic traits to specific chromosomes in yeast. This mapping is done using a set of 16 yeast strains each containing a different chromosome with a conditionally functional centromere. Conditional centromere function is achieved by integration of a  GAL1  promoter in  cis  to centromere sequences. We show that the 16 yeast chromosomes can be individually lost in diploid strains, which become hemizygous for the destabilized chromosome. Interestingly, most 2 n &# x02212; 1 strains endoduplicate and become 2 n . We also demonstrate how chromosome loss in this set of strains can be used to map both recessive and dominant markers to specific chromosomes. In addition, we show that this method can be used to rapidly validate gene assignments from screens of strain libraries such as the yeast gene disruption collection. THE centromere is the chromosomal element that ensures faithful segregation of duplicated chromosomes to both the mother and daughter during cell division. The yeast centromere is composed of an  &# x0223c;125-bp sequence that can be subdivided into three functional elements present at all yeast centromeres ( F itzgerald -H ayes et al.  1982 ;  P anzeri et al.  1985 ). These conserved DNA elements are binding sites for the centromere binding proteins Cbf1, Cse4, Mif2, and the CBF3 complex (Ndc10, Ctf13, Cep3, and Skp1) that together make up the inner kinetochore (reviewed in  C heeseman et al.  2002 ). The inner kinetochore associates with the central and outer kinetochore proteins to establish a link between the centromere of every chromosome and the mitotic spindle apparatus to ensure proper segregation during mitosis ( C heeseman et al.  2002 ). Early experiments designed to study centromeric DNA showed that chromosomal insertion of a strong promoter adjacent to  CEN  DNA abrogated centromere function ( P anzeri et al.  1984 ). This led to the construction of conditional centromeres by cloning strong regulatable promoters such as  GAL1  adjacent to  CEN  sequences to allow controlled inactivation ( C hlebowicz -S ledziewska  and S ledziewski  1985 ;  H ill  and B loom  1987 ). Conditional centromeres have been used to alter the stability of plasmids, YACs and whole chromosomes ( C hlebowicz -S ledziewska  and S ledziewski  1985 ;  H ill  and B loom  1987 ;  S mith et al.  1990 ). In a plasmid context, conditional centromeres can be used to amplify copy number since inactivating a  CEN  sequence relieves copy number control causing plasmid number to increase in the mother cell. At the same time, inactivation of the  CEN  sequence results in a higher frequency of plasmid loss, which can be selected with a counter-selectable marker. Likewise, when conditional centromeres are placed in a chromosomal context, chromosome loss can be induced to generate 2 n &# x02212; 1 diploids by counterselecting a marker on the conditional chromosome ( H ill  and B loom  1987 ). We took advantage of the  H ill  and B loom  (1987)  observation to produce a set of 16 centromere-conditional, counterselectable chromosomes in both  MAT a  and  MAT &# x003b1; strains. Here we show that these strains produce chromosome specific 2 n &# x02212; 1 monosomy and concomitant loss of heterozygosity (LOH). We show that chromosome-specific LOH can be used to map both recessive and dominant mutations using different readouts of the induced homozygous phenotype. This procedure is useful to map any unknown gene to a specific chromosome, which in turn accelerates the refinement of its genetic location. Finally, we show that this same approach can be used to verify that the phenotype of a haploid deletion library strain is indeed due to the  &# x0201c;advertised &# x0201d; gene disruption. G418 was purchased from MediaTech (Herndon, VA). Five (5)-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) was purchased from American Bioanalytical (Natick, MA). Taq DNA polymerase was purchased from Continental Laboratory Products (San Diego). Yeast extract &# x02013;peptone &# x02013;dextrose (YPD) medium, synthetic complete (SC) medium, synthetic dropout ( e.g. , SC  &# x02212;trp) media and 5-FOA medium were prepared as described ( S herman et al.  1986 ) except that 60  &# x003bc;g/ml of leucine were added to synthetic plates where appropriate. Sporulation medium was prepared as in  K lapholz  and E sposito  (1982) . Lithium acetate (LiOAc) transformations were performed as described ( S chiestl  and G ietz  1989 ). A PCR product with the  Kluyveromyces lactis URA3  gene was cloned into the  Bgl II and  Eco RI sites in pUK21 ( V ieira  and M essing  1991 ) to generate plasmid pUK21-KlUra3 (M3739), and a PCR product with the  GAL1  promoter was cloned into the  Bam HI and  Xba I sites in plasmid pUC21 to generate plasmid pUC21-GAL (M3738). A  Fse I &# x02013; Eag I fragment from pUC21-GAL containing the  GAL1  promoter was then cloned into pUK21-KlUra3 to generate pUK21-KlUGAL (M3756). A  Sac I &# x02013; Bss HII fragment from pUK21-KlUra3 was then cloned into pUC21-NotI ( V oth et al.  2001 ) to generate pKlUGAL-NotI (M3828) containing the  K. lactis URA3  gene and the  pGAL  promoter flanked by multiple cloning site cassettes.  CEN -proximal DNA sequences ( &# x0201c;left of CEN &# x0201d; and  &# x0201c;right of CEN &# x0201d;) were PCR amplified from each yeast chromosome for cloning into plasmid pKlUGAL-NotI (see supplemental Table S1 for primer sequences). The PCR primers used to amplify left of CEN DNA ( &# x0223c;800 &# x02013;1200 bp DNA to the immediate left of each centromere), added terminal  Sac I and  Sfi I restriction sites. Likewise, PCR primers used to amplify right of CEN DNA ( &# x0223c;800 &# x02013;1200 bp to the right of the centromere) added  Bss HII and  Bsi WI restriction sites. The left and right DNA fragments were then digested at the primer-encoded restriction sites for cloning into pKlUGAL-NotI to generate the pCEN-UG plasmid for 15 of the yeast chromosomes ( Figure 1A ). These plasmids each contain a specific centromere region interrupted by a  K. lactis URA3  gene and the  GAL1  promoter ( Figure 1A ). Integrating DNA fragments were liberated from the plasmids by  Not I digestion before transformation into strain W303-1A to replace the native centromere. The  CEN -proximal insertion for chromosome 14 was not isolated after two attempts using the plasmid-based clone. We therefore moved the  GAL1  promoter insertion to the other side of the chromosome 14 centromere using the PCR fusion method described below. A conditional centromere for chromosome 14 was constructed by PCR amplification of DNA to the left and right of the chromosome 14 centromere followed by PCR-based fusion to overlapping fragments of the  K. lactis URA3-GAL1  promoter cassette ( Figure 1, B &# x02013;D ). Amplification and PCR fusions were performed as described ( R eid et al.  2002 ). In the first round of PCR, a 418-bp left DNA fragment that included CEN14 was amplified using primer CHR14newUPR and adaptamer CHR14newUPF (see supplemental Table S1 for primer sequences). A left fragment of the  K. lactis URA3-GAL1  cassette from pCEN-UG was amplified using primer Kl-GALintF and adaptamer Kl-GALR. A 567-bp fragment of chromosome 14 DNA adjacent to and right of the centromere was amplified using primer CHR14newDNF and adaptamer CHR14newDNR. A right fragment of the  K. lactis URA3-GAL1  cassette was amplified using primer Kl-GALintR and adaptamer Kl-GALF. PCR products from the above reactions were fused in a second round of PCR using the complementary adaptamer tags to generate the illustrated products ( Figure 1D ). Transformation of the two PCR products into yeast and subsequent recombination generated a strain with a conditional centromere 14 ( Figure 1D ). All strains containing conditional centromeres were verified by PCR amplification using primers flanking the region of homology paired with primers internal to the  K. lactis URA3  coding region. Thus correct insertions could be monitored by amplification of a correct-sized DNA molecule (data not shown). Diploid strains containing a conditional centromere were made by crossing a  CEN -conditional strain to a test strain in patches, incubating on YPD medium for 24 hr at 30 &# x000b0;, then replica plating to the appropriate dropout medium to select for diploids. These diploids were then replica plated to rich medium containing galactose as a carbon source (YPgal) and grown for 24 hr at 30 &# x000b0; to induce centromere destabilization. Finally the  CEN -destabilized strains were streaked onto medium containing 5-FOA to select for cells that have lost the  K. lactis URA3  gene and become 2 n &# x02212; 1. Camptothecin (CPT) (Sigma, St Louis) was dissolved in DMSO and added to synthetic media at a concentration of 5  &# x003bc;g/ml with 0.25% DMSO final concentration. Drug-free control plates also contained 0.25% DMSO. Strains tested for CPT sensitivity in the verification experiments contained an additional wild-type  TOP1  allele on a  CEN  vector. The copper-inducible promoter from the  CUP1  gene was obtained from plasmid pPW66R ( D ohmen et al.  1994 ) after insertion of an  Mlu I linker to replace the DHFR-CDC28 fusion. The  pCUP1  promoter was excised on a 440-bp  Bam HI &# x02013; Mlu I fragment and cloned into those same sites in plasmid YCpScTOP1 ( K auh  and B jornsti  1995 ). The resulting  pCUP1-TOP1  fragment was then subcloned into plasmid pRS415 ( S ikorski  and H ieter  1989 ) to produce a  LEU2 -marked  CEN  plasmid expressing Top1. Sixteen haploid yeast strains with conditional centromeres were made by integrating a  GAL1  promoter into each chromosome directly adjacent to consensus centromere sequences ( Figure 1  and  Table 1 ). These conditional centromeres were constructed by cloning the  GAL1  promoter along with  K. lactis URA3  between segments of  CEN -proximal DNA followed by integration into the genome, or by a PCR-based construction and integration (as in  Figure 1 ). Proper integration of the  GAL1  promoter and  URA3  into each chromosome was assessed by PCR (see  materials and methods ) and the correct PCR fragment sizes were obtained for each modified  CEN  sequence (data not shown). In addition, each haploid strain grew normally on glucose medium but showed reduced viability on galactose medium, indicating that  GAL1  promoter induction adjacent to a centromere is not tolerated in a haploid cell (data not shown). Each strain bearing a conditional chromosome was tested for its ability to lose genetic markers on that chromosome upon galactose-induced promoter activation. These experiments were performed in heterozygous diploids and chromosome loss was ascertained by LOH. In most of these experiments, the  CEN- conditional strain was crossed to a test strain with one or more recessive auxotrophic markers covered by the corresponding wild-type alleles on the conditional chromosome. Chromosome loss and subsequent LOH was monitored by loss of the wild-type allele and acquisition of the auxotrophic phenotype. For example,  Figure 2A  shows a diagram of the relevant genetic markers on chromosome 14 after a cross of the  CEN14 -conditional strain (W3617-1B) to a tester strain (K393-27C). This diploid is heterozygous for the  met4  and  pet8  mutations on chromosome 14 and grows on SC  &# x02212;methionine as well as YPG (glycerol) media ( Figure 2B ). After induction of chromosome 14 loss (LOH 14 ) by growth on synthetic galactose medium followed by selection on 5-FOA medium, the LOH 14  strain fails to grow on SC  &# x02212;uracil, SC  &# x02212;methionine, and YPG, indicating the simultaneous loss of three different genetic markers: the  CEN -linked  URA3  marker, the wild-type  MET4 , and  PET8  alleles. In contrast, this strain remained prototrophic for histidine and lysine showing no LOH for heterozygous markers on chromosomes 6 and 9. Each of the 16  CEN -conditional strains was similarly tested for LOH.  Table 2  lists the strains used, the markers tested for each  CEN -conditional chromosome, and the LOH phenotype observed upon chromosome loss. Multiple independent diploids were produced for each experiment and 20 or more single colonies were examined for LOH. For chromosomes 3, 4, 7, and 14, multiple markers were tested for LOH events. For these and all other chromosomes, the appropriate marker loss was observed for each colony tested. At the same time, many heterozygous markers on chromosomes with unaltered centromeres were analyzed during these experiments and no LOH events were observed for those markers. There are multiple reports of haplo-insufficiency for specific yeast genes in a diploid background ( S tevens  and D avis  1998 ;  C hial et al.  1999 ;  D eutschbauer et al.  2005 ) and there are also deleterious physiological effects of aneuploidy for 13 yeast chromosomes ( T orres et al.  2007 ). We were therefore surprised to find that whole chromosome LOH events were easily obtained for all sixteen chromosomes. To further investigate these LOH events, we performed meiotic analysis for seven of the crosses listed in  Table 2 , plus three additional crosses using W303-derived strains. The  CEN -conditional strains used for meiotic analysis are listed in  Table 3  along with the tester strains that contained recessive auxotrophic marker(s). All 10 diploids were induced for chromosome loss, sporulated, and dissected. The LOH 1  and LOH 6  strains each showed 2:2 spore viability. All of the viable spores were uracil auxotrophs and the respective diploids also exhibited LOH for markers on chromosomes 1 or 6 ( ade1  and  his2 ), demonstrating that, in both cases, the chromosome containing the conditional centromere was lost. In contrast, LOH events for the other seven chromosomes tested in  Table 3  showed a preponderance of four viable spores. In these cases, all spore products were uracil auxotrophs and showed 4:0 segregation for the marker listed in the LOH column ( Table 3 ). The  MAT  locus showed 2:2 segregation as did any additional unlinked markers that were tested (fourth column in  Table 3 ). Thus, it appears that for most whole chromosome LOH events, chromosome loss is followed by endoduplication of an entire chromosome. We suspect that there is strong selective pressure for such an endoduplication event, especially for the large chromosomes, due to haplo-insufficiency ( S tevens  and D avis  1998 ;  C hial et al.  1999 ;  D eutschbauer et al.  2005 ). In support of this notion, we noted that during selection for LOH strains on galactose and 5-FOA media, colonies were heterogeneous in size. After additional passage, these various-sized colonies grow more uniformly, perhaps due to endoduplication. However, it is noteworthy that even after endoduplication, these diploids maintain the LOH, which permits the mapping methods presented below. The experiments described above demonstrate that conditional chromosomes efficiently induce LOH after induction. We used conditional LOH induction to develop a method to rapidly map a recessive genetic marker to a specific chromosome. For the first test of this method, we used an unknown camptothecin-sensitive gene ( cptS ) in the  his5 &# x00394; strain from the yeast gene disruption library ( W inzeler et al.  1999 ) that we found during a screen for camptothecin sensitivity (R. J. D. R eid  and R. R othstein , unpublished observations). Genetic analysis showed that the  cptS  gene is unlinked to  his5 &# x00394;. To map the unknown mutation, a  cptS HIS5  segregant was isolated and crossed to each of the 16  CEN -conditional strains. Diploids were selected and induced for chromosome loss by growth on synthetic galactose medium followed by selection on 5-FOA medium. The LOH strains were then grown, serially diluted, and spotted on synthetic medium with and without camptothecin. As shown in  Figure 3 , the  cptS  LOH 2  strain shows a  &# x0003e;10,000-fold growth reduction on camptothecin compared to the no-drug control. A control cross of a wild-type strain to all of the  CEN -conditional strains using the same conditions for induction of chromosome loss resulted in no increased camptothecin sensitivity in any particular LOH strain. Although the chromosome 2 heterozygous strain initially grows slowly on galactose, it is the only one that becomes CPT sensitive when the conditional centromere-bearing chromosome is lost ( Figure 3 ). Thus, the unknown camptothecin-sensitive phenotype in the  MAT &# x003b1;  his5 &# x00394; &# x02237; KanMX  deletion strain is due to a recessive gene on chromosome 2. Next, we tested candidate genes on chromosome 2 for complementation of the  cptS  drug sensitivity. To choose the candidates, we took advantage of the fact that the  cptS  gene showed very high CPT sensitivity, but was not sensitive to gamma irradiation at 200 Gy (data not shown). A gene on chromosome 2,  MMS4 , has a similar phenotype when it is mutated ( X iao et al.  1998 ;  B astin -S hanower et al.  2003 ). Two other mutants that map on chromosome 2 (the weakly CPT-sensitive  atg14 &# x00394; &# x02237; KanMX  mutant and a drug-resistant mutant,  ybr204c &# x00394; &# x02237; KanMX ) were also included in the complementation test ( Figure 4 ). Diploids from the cross of the  cptS  strain to  atg14  and  ybr204c  are resistant to camptothecin and thus showed complementation. However, diploids from the cross of  cptS  to  mms4 &# x00394; fail to complement as they show camptothecin sensitivity comparable to both the  mms4 &# x00394; and the  cptS  haploid strains indicating that the unknown  cptS  gene on chromosome 2 is allelic to  MMS4 . Not every case of chromosome-scale mapping will provide potential candidate genes as in the example above. As an alternative, the unknown mutant can be crossed with all of the members of the haploid gene deletion set for a particular chromosome and then be tested for complementation. This is feasible with a simple phenotypic assay such as drug sensitivity. However, even after systematic crosses, the unknown gene may not exist in the haploid deletion library ( e.g. , essential genes), and this approach may fail to identify the locus. Therefore, another approach to localize the unknown gene is via traditional two-point crosses. For example, chromosome 2 is 813 kb, with a physical-to-genetic distance ratio of 0.3 kb/cM ( C herry et al.  1997 ). Tetrad analysis can provide a reasonable measure of genetic distance up to 50 cM. Thus approximately eight equally spaced genetic markers on chromosome 2 could be used to map the genetic location of the unknown gene. Since the deletion library is marked with  KanMX , appropriately spaced deletion strains can be used directly for this mapping. Finally, the genetic location can be ascertained systematically with multiple strains from the deletion library using the synthetic genetic array method ( J orgensen et al.  2002 ). Using this approach, the mutant phenotype is screened after crosses with all of the markers on the chromosome of interest. The use of  &# x0201c;magic &# x0201d; markers ensures that after sporulation, only haploid progeny grow, permitting selection for the KanMX marker and subsequent screening for the mutant phenotype. In this case, the gene is localized when it fails to appear in the KanMX segregants that surround its map location. The  CEN -conditional strains can also be used to map dominant alleles after LOH induction. In this case, the LOH event must be analyzed after meiosis. For example, a dominant allele on chromosome 2 that is crossed to the  CEN2 -conditional strain becomes homozygous after LOH 2 . Since chromosome 2, like most chromosomes, undergoes endoduplication, sporulation and dissection of only the LOH 2  strain produces 4:0 spores for the dominant phenotype. In contrast, among the remaining  CEN -conditional crosses (note, LOH 3  does not sporulate), the dominant allele on chromosome 2 remains heterozygous after LOH for each chromosome and equal numbers of mutant and wild-type meiotic products are produced upon sporulation (2:2). The difference between 2:2 and 4:0 segregation can be easily determined by tetrad analysis. In LOH events where endoduplication does not occur, such as LOH 1 , the same analysis is made except that tetrads of LOH 1  strains are 2:2 for viability. Therefore among the live spore products, an unlinked gene segregates 1:1, while a chromosome 1-linked gene segregates 2:0. To facilitate the mapping of a dominant gene, a dissection-free protocol can be performed by random spore analysis. In the following example, we show how we confirmed the chromosome map position of a gene disruption from the yeast deletion library by scoring the  KanMX  dominant selectable marker. The  yor364w &# x02237; KanMX4  strain from the  MAT &# x003b1; library, which contains a wild-type  CAN1  gene, was crossed to each of the  CEN -conditional chromosome strains, which contain the  can1-100  mutation. The  CAN1  gene is useful in this assay since  CAN1 / can1-100  diploids and  CAN1  haploids are sensitive to canavanine and thus the only canavanine-resistant colonies that grow after sporulation are  can1-100  haploids. Diploids were isolated and induced for chromosome loss. The LOH strains were sporulated and the asci were digested with glusulase to disrupt the tetrads and produce single spores ( S herman et al.  1986 ). Next, the spores were diluted and plated so that  &# x02264;300 colonies formed on synthetic medium containing canavanine. The haploid colonies were replica plated to G418 medium and the number of G418-resistant colonies was counted and compared to the total number of canavanine-resistant colonies ( Table 4 ). For this analysis, chromosomes 3 and 5 cannot be assayed since LOH 3  events homozygose the  MAT  locus and do not sporulate, while the  can1-100  allele is lost with the conditional chromosome 5. For 13 of the 14 remaining crosses,  &# x0223c;50% of the colonies in the random spore analysis are G418 resistant indicating random segregation of the  KanMX -marked chromosome. In contrast, for the LOH 15  strain, all of the canavanine-resistant haploids are also G418 resistant, indicating that the  KanMX  marker has become homozygous due to LOH. Thus the  yor364 &# x00394; &# x02237; KanMX  allele is mapped to chromosome 15 confirming its chromosome position. There are some limitations to mapping procedures using the  CEN -conditional strains described here. For example, any analyses that require sporulation, such as mapping a dominant gene, fail for chromosome 3. Therefore, we assign a gene to chromosome 3 by process of elimination. However, this limitation can be overcome by providing a plasmid-borne (or nonchromosome 3) copy of the same mating-type locus in the  CEN3 -conditional strains. Thus, when the native chromosome 3 is lost, the additional  MAT  locus provides mating-type function for sporulation. Another problem occurs during the random spore procedure for meiotic LOH analysis. The  can1-100  allele is used to select haploid spore clones. Since LOH 5  results in loss of that recessive drug-resistant mutation, we are unable to select haploid strains during plating for chromosome 5. This limitation can be overcome by introducing  lyp1  or  cyh2  ( rpl28 ) mutations on chromosomes 14 or 7 into the chromosome 5 strain, since these alleles cause recessive drug resistance to thiol-lysine ( G renson  1966 ) and cycloheximide ( K aufer et al.  1983 ), respectively. Several methods have previously been developed to map a gene to a specific chromosome. In some of these methods, chromosome loss is randomly induced in certain genetic backgrounds, for example by sporulation of a triploid strain as in  W ickner  (1979) . Behavior of the unknown gene is then compared to chromosome-specific markers to narrow the map position to a single chromosome. Another mapping method employs a  spo11-1  mutation to suppress recombination during sporulation, thus limiting the segregation of an unknown marker  vs.  chromosome-specific markers in predictable ways ( K lapholz  and E sposito  1982 ). In these random chromosome loss and  rec &# x02212;  methods, a mutation must first be crossed into appropriate strain backgrounds before mapping occurs. In contrast, no strain construction is required for our LOH mapping procedure. The unknown mutation need only be in a  ura3  strain. A mapping method that induces specific chromosome loss to allow analysis by LOH was also developed on the basis of 2 &# x003bc;-integration into all 16 yeast chromosomes in cir 0  strains ( W akem  and S herman  1990 ). However in this method of chromosome loss, LOH events can routinely occur for only one chromosome arm depending on the site of 2 &# x003bc;-integration (R. R othstein  and G. C hrebet , unpublished observations). Thus, many more than 16 strains are required for crosses to an unknown to cover the entire genome. On the other hand, the method of chromosome loss induction described here produces LOH for all markers on a given chromosome and thus greatly simplifies the LOH analysis compared to the 2 &# x003bc;-integrations. The methods described here rely on lack of complementation after an LOH event to identify the chromosome containing a given recessive marker. This principle can be used to validate a screen and verify that the gene responsible for a phenotype is likely linked to the corresponding gene disruption. As an example we used the centromere-conditional strains described in this report to verify all of our  &# x0201c;hits &# x0201d; in a recently completed screen of the yeast gene disruption library. In that screen, we expressed a  TOP1  allele ( top1-T 722 A ) that acts as a CPT mimetic and damages DNA ( M egonigal et al.  1997 ). The full results of this screen will be described elsewhere (R. J. D. R eid  and R. R othstein , unpublished results). In brief, the mutant  TOP1  allele was expressed from the copper-inducible  CUP1  promoter on a  CEN  plasmid that had been transferred into each strain in the deletion library. Heterologous expression of the mutant allele induces DNA damage and most of the deletion mutants identified as sensitive to expression of the  top1-T 722 A  are also CPT sensitive. Approximately 140 strains showed increased sensitivity to expression of the  top1-T 722 A  mutant compared to wild type. To assure that DNA damage sensitivity was due to the specific  KanMX -marked mutations, we performed a secondary screen by crossing each of the 140 strains to the conditional centromere strain corresponding to the deletion allele's chromosome. These hybrid diploids also contain an additional wild-type copy of  TOP1  on a plasmid, which effectively increases the sensitivity of yeast strains to CPT ( R eid et al.  1998 ). All 140 strains were retested for CPT sensitivity after LOH induction and an example of the retest results from four different chromosome-8 mutants isolated in our screen are shown in  Figure 5 . These four mutant strains were crossed to the  CEN8 -conditional strain and induced for LOH 8 . Any spurious recessive factors residing on another chromosome that might result in DNA damage sensitivity would be complemented in the LOH 8  strain. None of the heterozygous diploids, including a wild-type control, exhibits CPT sensitivity before LOH. We found that 3 of the 4 mutant strains are drug sensitive after LOH 8  induction, indicating that for those 3 strains the gene disruption on chromosome 8 was the likely cause of drug sensitivity. On the other hand, the  dia4  mutant showed no CPT sensitivity in LOH 8  diploids and thus we could eliminate further study of this strain. Approximately 70% of the mutants isolated in the  top1-T 722 A  mutant screen validated after rescreening by LOH. Spurious secondary mutations unlinked to the  KanMX  insertions have been identified in the deletion library ( L ehner et al.  2007 ) and we showed one such example above ( cptS / mms4 ). In principle, such a mutation can occur on the same chromosome as a library gene disruption and would not be identified as a false positive using the method described here. A hypothetical worst case occurs when verifying chromosome-4 deletion strains. But even though chromosome 4 contains  &# x0223c;13% of the total coding DNA in yeast, our LOH rescreen would remove 87% of the cases of secondary mutants assuming that these would be distributed randomly on all chromosomes. We assume that the contribution of spurious secondary mutations in these screens is relatively small, so removing  &# x0223c;90% of such events is quite good. We have produced a set of 16 centromere-conditional chromosomes that can be used to induce LOH. The systematic LOH induction described here provides a simple and effective means of mapping both recessive and dominant alleles to specific chromosomes. In addition, hybrid diploid formation and LOH can be used to complement spurious genetic variation in strains isolated in library screens.

(A) The pCEN-UG plasmids were constructed by amplifying centromere-proximal DNA (thick solid offset lines), including the  CEN  locus (solid circle) and cloning into plasmid pKlUGAL-NotI. This cloning generates a  CEN -proximal region that is interrupted by the  K. lactis URA3  gene and a  GAL1  promoter. The  CEN  disruption fragment is liberated from the plasmid by digestion with  Not I. AMP-R indicates the  beta lactamase  gene from the pUK21 plasmid backbone. (B) The  CEN14  insertion DNA was made by PCR amplification of centromere-proximal sequences using primers indicated by the open arrows. (C) The promoter-marker cassette from A was amplified using primers indicated by the open arrows. The PCR products from B and C contain sequence tags on the primers that are reverse and complementary so that the resulting DNAs could be fused in a second round of PCR (open circle in B fuses to open circle in C and open diamond in B fuses to open diamond in C). (D) Recombination between the marker segments and genomic integration (denoted by x's) replaces the native centromere with a conditional centromere. Strains Induction of chromosome-14 loss induces LOH for multiple alleles. (A) The conditional  CEN  strain W3617-1B was mated to strain K393-27C to produce a diploid with the following genotype:  MAT a / &# x003b1;  CEN14/cen14 &# x02237;K lactis-URA3 ura3-1/ura3-1 MET17/met17 met4/MET4 pet8/PET8 his2/HIS2 HIS3/his3-11,15 lys1-1/LYS1 LYS2/lys2 . The resulting diploid contained heterozygous markers for  PET8  and  MET4  on chromosome 14 drawn approximately to scale. (B) The diploid strain was grown on galactose-containing medium and then 5-FOA medium to induce LOH. The diploid parent and subsequent LOH strain (LOH 14 ) were streaked onto the indicated media to check for viability. Failure to grow signifies loss of  URA3 ,  PET8 , and  MET4. Crosses to examine chromosome-specific LOH Meiotic analysis of LOH in diploids Mapping an unknown camptothecin-sensitive mutant. An unknown gene ( cptS ) in the  MAT &# x003b1; library  his5 &# x00394; &# x02237; KanMX  strain results in camptothecin sensitivity. The  cptS  gene was separated from the  his5 &# x00394; allele by backcross. The resulting mutant strain and a wild-type control were subsequently crossed to the 16  CEN -conditional strains, chromosome loss was induced, and the resulting LOH strains were grown, diluted, and spotted on plates with or without 0 or 5  &# x003bc;g/ml camptothecin. The LOH 2  strain crossed to the  cptS  gene fails to grow in the presence of 5  &# x003bc;g/ml of camptothecin. Complementation analysis of a camptothecin-sensitive gene on chromosome 2. The  cptS  mutant strain was crossed to three strains with deletions on chromosome 2. The resulting diploids (top three strains) and the parent haploid strains (bottom four) were spotted onto plates with 0 or 5  &# x003bc;g/ml camptothecin to assay drug sensitivity. Failure to complement shows that  cptS  is allelic to  mms4 . Random spore analysis of G418 resistance in LOH diploids LOH method to verify camptothecin sensitivity. Four yeast strains with gene deletions on chromosome 8 were identified in a screen for sensitivity to expression of the camptothecin mimetic  top1-T 722 A . These strains were crossed to a  CEN8 -conditional strain that was transformed with plasmid-borne  TOP1  expressed from the  CUP1  promoter. The diploids and subsequent LOH 8  strains were grown and diluted for spot assays on media with 0 or 5  &# x003bc;g/ml camptothecin (CPT) and 0 or 50  &# x003bc; m  copper to induce  TOP1  expression and increase camptothecin sensitivity. Only the  dia4  disruption shows CPT resistance after LOH 8  indicating that the sensitivity of the haploid strain is not due to  dia4 .
