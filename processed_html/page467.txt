The input data and output data can be considered as a linguistic variables characterized by fuzzy numbers. So, in the present study, we extend DEA to fuzzy DEA (FDEA) in which the input and output data are taken as fuzzy numbers (FNs), in particular triangular FNs. In this paper, we develop two FDEA models to measure the left hand and right hand relative performance efficiencies of each DMU using  \alpha \alpha -cut approach. Further, we propose a ranking method to rank the DMUs based on left hand and right hand efficiencies. Finally, the developed FDEA models and proposed ranking models are illustrated with an example and then compared the results with geometric average efficiency index ranking method. The proposed model is also experimented with a real-life problem. Charnes et al. [ 7 ] developed DEA approach to measure the relative performance efficiencies of decision making units (DMUs), and Banker et al. [ 5 ] extended to study returns to scale (RTS). DMUs can be any governmental agencies and nonprofitable organizations like hospitals, educational institutions, banks, transportation. The relative performance efficiency of DMU is defined as the ratio of its performance efficiency to the largest performance efficiency. The relative performance efficiency of a DMU lies in the range (0, 1]. DEA determines the efficient and inefficient DMUs and also finds the most efficient DMUs and the inefficient DMUs for which efficiency improvements are possible. DEA improves the productivity of the inefficient DMUs by reducing inputs and/or increasing outputs. DEA calculates the efficiency of DMUs which have multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Real-world problems have some input and/or output data which possess some degree of fluctuation or imprecision or uncertainties such as quality of input resources, quality of treatment, the satisfaction level of patients, quality of medicines in health sector. The fluctuation can take the form of intervals, ordinal relations and fuzzy numbers etc. Therefore, to deal with such type of real-life situations, we propose to extend crisp DEA to Fuzzy DEA (FDEA) by making the use of fuzzy numbers in DEA. FDEA models represent real-world applications more realistically than the conventional DEA models. Despotis et al. [ 8 ] proposed left hand and right hand DEA models with imprecise input–output data. These models are not suitable for fuzzy data. In real-life applications, the input–output data fluctuate. In this paper, we have taken the fluctuation in the form of fuzzy numbers (FNs), particularly triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs). So, we have propose the left and right hand fuzzy DEA (FDEA) models using  \alpha \alpha -cut. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect.  2  presents literature review. Section  3  presents the preliminary, Sect.  4  presents the proposed FDEA models and proposed ranking approach. Section  5  presents an example and an application of the proposed approach to the health sector. Conclusions of the study are given in the last section of the paper. In this section, we will give literature review for FDEA and ranking. There exist various mathematical programs in DEA such as fractional DEA program, output maximization (input oriented) and input minimization (output oriented), SBM DEA programs. Mogha et al. [ 17 ] proposed a new slack model (NSM) of DEA, which directly deals with input and output slacks, to assess the efficiency of public sector hospitals of State of Uttarakhand (India). Tyagi et al. [ 24 ] applied DEA to determine the performance efficiencies of academic departments of IIT Roorkee (India). There are some studies of DEA with applications to health care both public and private sector in Indian context [ 17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ]. Hollingsworth et al. [ 12 ] described the economic theory of efficiency and productivity, and their measurement in health care using DEA and found the potential benefits and problems of measuring efficiency. Adang and Wensing [ 1 ] presented the potential discrepancy between long-run and short-run efficiencies of innovative technologies in health care and explored dis-economy of scale in Dutch hospitals. Barnum and Walton [ 6 ] presented the effect of the conflict between DEA and hospital applications and found efficiency indicators that assume nonsubstitutability rather than substitutability. Akdag et al. [ 3 ] evaluated the service quality of some Turkish hospitals by fuzzy MCDM approach. Several researches have been done in different areas both from DEA and FDEA perspective. Alizadeh et al. [ 4 ] presented the location–allocation models of fuzzy multi-objective nonlinear programming in FDEA and found the solution procedure based on a modification of fuzzy parametric programming (FPP) and minimum deviation method. Tsai et al. [ 23 ] proposed the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy sensitive analysis-based approach to resolve the uncertainty and imprecision of service evaluations during pre-negotiation stages, where the comparison judgments of a decision maker are represented as triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs). Dotoli et al. [ 9 ] developed a novel cross-efficiency fuzzy DEA model for evaluating different elements under uncertainty with application to health-care system. Jahanshahloo et al. [ 13 ] proposed a slack-based measure (SBM) model which is employed for evaluation and ranking of all DMUs and extended this model to an FDEA model for evaluating efficiency and ranking of DMUs with fuzzy data. Kao and Liu [ 14 ] reduced the crisp DEA model into the fuzzy DEA model using  \alpha \alpha -cut method and expressed performance efficiency as a fuzzy number. Khodabakhshi et al. [ 15 ] developed a ranking method to rank all DMUs. Lotfi et al. [ 16 ] proposed a ranking method by using generalized variance for inputs and outputs. Wen et al. [ 26 ] transformed fuzzy model into linear programming with the help of new approach combined with fuzzy simulation and genetic algorithm. Guo and Wu [ 10 ] proposed a unique ranking method by using undesirable outputs through new Maximal Balance Index (MBI) based on the optimal shadow prices. Adler et al. [ 2 ] discussed different ranking methods in DEA. Puri and Yadav [ 21 ] proposed a ranking method for crisp as well as fuzzy numbers for optimistic and pessimistic models and finally proposed a complete ranking method using super-efficiency technique. Wang et al. [ 25 ] proposed the geometric average efficiency index to determine the overall performance efficiency and ranking of the DMUs in crisp DEA. This section includes some basic definitions and notions of fuzzy set theory which are required to develop the concept of FDEA for handling fuzzy inputs/outputs in real-life problems. It includes the definitions of fuzzy set (FS), fuzzy number (FN) and triangular fuzzy number (TFN). DEA evaluates the relative performance efficiency of a DMU in a set of homogeneous DMUs. The relative performance efficiency of a DMU lies in the range (0, 1]. there exists exactly one  x_0\in {\mathbb {R}} x_0\in {\mathbb {R}}  with  \mu _{{\tilde{A}}}(x_0)=1 \mu _{{\tilde{A}}}(x_0)=1 . \mu _{{\tilde{A}}}(x) \mu _{{\tilde{A}}}(x)  is a piecewise continuous. TFN (a,b,c) \alpha \alpha cut:  The  \alpha \alpha -cut of a fuzzy set  {\tilde{A}} {\tilde{A}}  is denoted by  A_{\alpha } A_{\alpha }  and defined by A_{\alpha }=\{x \in X{:}\, \mu _{A(x)}\ge {\alpha }\} A_{\alpha }=\{x \in X{:}\, \mu _{A(x)}\ge {\alpha }\} , where  {\alpha }\in [0,1] {\alpha }\in [0,1] . Let us suppose that the performance of a set of n homogeneous DMUs (DMUj;  j = 1,\ldots ,n j = 1,\ldots ,n ) is to be measured. Suppose that m inputs produce s outputs. Let us assume that the amount of the rth output produced by the jth DMU is  y_{rj},r=1,2,3,\ldots ,s y_{rj},r=1,2,3,\ldots ,s  and the amount of the ith input consumed by the jth DMU is  x_{ij},i=1,2,3,\ldots ,m x_{ij},i=1,2,3,\ldots ,m . Let  E_{j} =\dfrac{\sum _{r=1}^{s}{v_r}{[y_{rj}^L,y_{rj}^U]}}{\sum _{i=1}^{m}{u_i}{[x_{ij}^L,x_{ij}^U]}},\,j=1,2,3,\ldots ,n E_{j} =\dfrac{\sum _{r=1}^{s}{v_r}{[y_{rj}^L,y_{rj}^U]}}{\sum _{i=1}^{m}{u_i}{[x_{ij}^L,x_{ij}^U]}},\,j=1,2,3,\ldots ,n . Obtain the left hand efficiency  E_{j_o}^L E_{j_o}^L  and right hand efficiency  E_{j_o}^U E_{j_o}^U  for each  {\hbox {DMU}}_{j_o} {\hbox {DMU}}_{j_o}  using left hand model (Model 9) and right hand model (Model 10), respectively. Let  I=\{1,2,\ldots ,n\} I=\{1,2,\ldots ,n\}  be an index set. Suppose that  T_1= {\hbox {min}}\left\{ E_{j_o}^L|j_o\in I\right\} T_1= {\hbox {min}}\left\{ E_{j_o}^L|j_o\in I\right\}  and  T_2= {\hbox {min}}\left\{ E_{j_o}^U|j_o\in I\right\} T_2= {\hbox {min}}\left\{ E_{j_o}^U|j_o\in I\right\} .  T_1 T_1  and  T_2 T_2  are the minimum efficiencies obtained from left hand and right hand models, respectively. Let us suppose that  R_1= {\hbox {max}}\left\{ E_{j_o}^L|j_o\in I\right\} R_1= {\hbox {max}}\left\{ E_{j_o}^L|j_o\in I\right\}  and  R_2= {\hbox {max}}\left\{ E_{j_o}^U|j_o\in I\right\} R_2= {\hbox {max}}\left\{ E_{j_o}^U|j_o\in I\right\} .  R_1 R_1  and  R_2 R_2  are the maximum efficiencies obtained from left hand and right hand models, respectively. Find the deviations  D{j_o}^L D{j_o}^L  and  D{j_o}^U D{j_o}^U  in the left hand and right hand efficiencies for all DMUs, where  D{j_o}^L=\dfrac{R_1-E_{j_o}^L}{R_1-T_1} D{j_o}^L=\dfrac{R_1-E_{j_o}^L}{R_1-T_1}  and  D{j_o}^U= \dfrac{R_2-E_{j_o}^U}{R_2-T_2},j_o\in I D{j_o}^U= \dfrac{R_2-E_{j_o}^U}{R_2-T_2},j_o\in I . Find the total deviation  D_{j_o}=D{j_o}^U+D{j_o}^L D_{j_o}=D{j_o}^U+D{j_o}^L  for each  {\hbox {DMU}}_{j_o},j_o\in I {\hbox {DMU}}_{j_o},j_o\in I . Rank all DMUs according to the increasing values of  D_{j_o} D_{j_o} . Flow chart for stepwise procedure To ascertain the validity of the proposed methodology, we consider the following examples.

of the DMUs (Sect.  4.2 ). Also, we have proposed a ranking method, which presents not only a full ranking but also the information that to what degree a fuzzy efficiency is bigger/lesser than that of other DMUs (Sect.  4.3 ). The proposed ranking approach is compared with geometric average method [ 25 ]. The proposed methods have been applied to two examples (i) to determine the performance efficiencies of 5 DMUs which is taken from Guo and Tanaka [ 11 ] and (ii) to determine the performance efficiencies of 12 hospitals of Meerut district, India. The inefficiency percentage of 12 hospitals  \left[{\text{ inefficiency } \text{ percentage }}= \left( 1-\dfrac{D_{j_o}}{{\hbox {Highest}}\, D_{j_o}}\right) \times 100\%\right] \left[{\text{ inefficiency } \text{ percentage }}= \left( 1-\dfrac{D_{j_o}}{{\hbox {Highest}}\, D_{j_o}}\right) \times 100\%\right]  for  \alpha =1 \alpha =1  is  {\hbox {H}}2(100\%) >  {\hbox {H}}1(99\%) >  {\hbox {H}}8(96\%) >  {\hbox {H}}3(91\%) > {\hbox {H}}9(75\%) > {\hbox {H}}5(68\%) >  {\hbox {H}}12(43\%) > {\hbox {H}}11(40\%) > {\hbox {H}}6(14\%) >  {\hbox {H}}10(13\%) >  {\hbox {H}}7(12\%)  >  {\hbox {H}}4(0\%) {\hbox {H}}2(100\%)> {\hbox {H}}1(99\%)> {\hbox {H}}8(96\%)> {\hbox {H}}3(91\%)>{\hbox {H}}9(75\%)>{\hbox {H}}5(68\%)> {\hbox {H}}12(43\%)>{\hbox {H}}11(40\%)>{\hbox {H}}6(14\%)> {\hbox {H}}10(13\%)> {\hbox {H}}7(12\%) > {\hbox {H}}4(0\%) . According to inefficiency percentage of 12 hospitals for  \alpha =1 \alpha =1 , the most inefficient DMU is Sardhana (H2) and worst inefficient DMU is Bhudbharal (H4). The input inefficiency percentage represents the degree to which the input should change to become fully efficient. We are working to develop the left and right hand FDEA models and ranking methodology which can take care of public and private sector hospitals, etc. where input–output data are available in subjective and linguistic forms. Further we plan to apply integrated fuzzy VIKOR method developed by Shekarian et al. [ 22 ] to assess and rank the quality of public and private sector hospitals.
