the first supplements you ever used for years supplement companies sold tons of this stuff why because it worked today the weight gainer has lost much of its popularity and over the years the weight

hey guys so ive never written a review in my life but this protein powder has to be addressed ..dont buy this after trying the shake for my first time i passed out from the ingredients and projectile vommitted everywhere for the love that is all holy dont buy this garbage has carbo syn in it works best with food cheapest protein for best results been working out for 46 days seen extreme results i ve been using gain fast for 2 years now and definitely seen increase in strength and mass never used full serving size only half of it per day with skimmed milk as i only needed 700 calories plus good stuff this was the first supplement i ever bought back in 2014 and it was so bad it didn t mix i would always end up moving it from the shaker to a mixer or i would use a spoon just to try to mix it it tasted bad and literally did nothing does not mix great plus got a pepper taste while drinking it this is one of the worst protein supplements i have used i was pretty shocked considering the quality of all other universal products i ve purchased i have used universal gains and mass and they have been fantastic the reason i rated this product higher than taste is because it didn t give me any gi issues like a cheap protein it seemed to digest fine but the taste ughh it doesn t blend well at all even two scoops in 12oz liquid doesn t shake it lumps sticks to the sides like mud and even after finally blended and smashed and stirred with a spoon there are little white lumps and grainy spots the chocolate is terrible and has a very odd aftertaste like cayenne pepper it also leaves a slimy film in your mouth never again decent gainer shake with really just about all you need to put on mass thicker than real gains by a longshot higher carbs and sugars so that is the reason why cnc is ok but it does not stand out to me has a faint smokey type of flavor but not a definite cnc banana split shake is bolder and more delicious when you open it up you get hit with this marshmellow banana aroma ultimately it is my favorite so far by far mix is average for one scoop for a gainer dont recommend 2-3 in a sitting unless you plan to sit for a while tryina drink it all down a scoop aint so bad definitely is filling for the price you cant go wrong for the big tub helped me add 3 lbs in a month after plateauing in the wintertime increased my calories cant say it is better than real gains but i can tell you it is the best value in a gainer there is from what i ve found oh man this one gon na make your stomach diarrhea all over the place thump down i used 2.5lbs but not seen a difference.not recommended the taste is good it actually taste like an ice cream bar however i found this product contains way too much sugar i bought the cookies and cream the taste was really eh overall it helped me hit my macros and the sugar intake is just too much in here
