people who do physics or engineering but are not called physicists or engineers and the reverse problem there are plenty of people who call themselves physicists who are not formally recognised as such and others who call themselves engineers but are not formally recognised as such this apparently is quite acceptable human behaviour after all many people over the centuries have staged a coup and called themselves president of some country or even emperor and got away with it some are worthy of that honorary title some are not the modern journalist i would perhaps call instead a professional publicist but that is another story so i say i get to call myself a theoretical physicist even though many would say i am not i would never call myself a professional physicist even if you paid me mostly i do this to annoy real physicists but also because i have also spent ten years diligently and methodically exploring the unification problem in physics and have put a couple of phd efforts into it and i do know what it takes to be qualified competent and expert in a scientific field of study been there done that which brings me to another point you see formal recognition of profession has traditionally been in the domain and at the whim of the university or the master tradesmen in the case of trades but just what that means in the modern era is quite beyond me the formal process of accreditation of profession in the modern internet society is mostly broken certainly very blurred and completely unsuited to the actual jobs most people including myself actually do apart from their exceptional role as centres of excellence in given fields of study the typical modern university is no longer primarily a centre of learning but a business providing accreditation for profit they could care less yes i accept some individuals in the process still do care if the learning was fit for purpose and suited to lead the student to an actual job or to be actually competent at that job and they have subsumed the trade accreditation process into the university process throwing out with it the whole principle that makes trades actually work the master/apprentice relationship just like the phd the master/apprentice degree for science and research has typically been butchered into a three way negotiation between business the university consumer the student is always right and employee the supervisor the days of us being trained and attributed to a single profession as i was to chemical engineering are long gone even if universities tasked with accrediting us have manifestly failed to keep up and still pretend it is so universities have not kept pace well with the need for the cross-discipline training required in most modern jobs which require broad training across all the stem subjects including programming and applied mathematics yes i worked for a university for over ten years have two engineering degrees and have seen my children subjected to the modern abomination of a university in australia so i think i feel qualified to comment to my mind universities should accredit the aggregate of study courses to an internationally agreed standard rather than by generic degree name far more useful to a potential employer or student alike and it should be a life long relationship that you come back to as needed for additional courses this does of course raise the problem of what it is you call yourself and what you do but better to be employed without knowing what to call yourself than to be an unemployed physicist curiously you rarely see an unemployed engineer which is perhaps why you see many physicists doing engineering after the grief physicists have given me i could not resist that little dig today for example i call myself a programmer because i am spending it as soon as i finish this post i promise developing commercial code for analysing a prompt gamma neutron gauge signal yesterday i was an applied mathematician working on techniques for isolating compton scattered components out of a spectrum and so on but to do that effectively i need to know about neutrons and how they generate prompt gammas hey now i am a physicist but that in itself does not make me expert in general relativity and i need to understand how the gammas are collected by a scintillation crystal/ mca multi-channel analyser because these devices are not perfect and have signal artefacts that have to be detected and rejected so i need a bit of applied physics and electrical engineering last month i was a metallurgical engineer up to my elbows in iron ore slurry in a mineral jig in india followed by reprogramming the plc system used to control this device followed by teaching a course on gravity concentration devices no the mundane engineering earth gravity kind for separating particles of different densities not gravitational physics of wormholes and so on see it gets complicated what to call yourself some engineering disciplines have better/wider grounding in physics than others the rather misnamed discipline of chemical engineering being one of them where you can just do a couple of the final year courses in modern physics to have the knowledge to get quite an acceptable physics degree a civil engineer i expect would have to formally do a physics degree but may well bring a lot of good knowledge to a job in physics for example how to isolate an interferometer platform from vibration similarly the practice of observational physics is far more aligned to engineering activities than theoretical physics and if you are in the latter camp with a physics degree transitioning to and/or including engineering will be quite difficult there is also a mind-set associated with each discipline a world view if you like of how best to do that field of study typically if reading about the topic interests you then you likely have the right mind-set for it i will give a practical example from personal experience of how important cross-disciplinary training is important in the modern era physicists measuring g newtons constant took ages years to work out a particular source of bias in the torsion pendulums they were using i hate to think of the wasted time and effort but once this bias was found and explained many papers were written to great excitement at this discovery but read the mechanical engineering literature and this problem was recognised and modelled accurately long long ago nothing wrong of course with reinventing the wheel but think of the saving in research dollars oh wait other peoples money right so physics includes a really broad range of topics as does engineering and nobody can be expert across all of them i suspect even a trained physicist working a career in general relativity poking their nose into the standard model would get it cut off can people do both physics and engineering yes can they be both physicists and engineers yes with a touch of reservation i would prefer to see a reference to particular topics of study can someone competently know all of physics and engineering or even all of each not a hope 4,628 views 354,589 views 1,343

three times i am a physicist. just kidding there is no physicists creed but i promise you that every physicist wishes there were one they just might disagree about how it would read of course you can knowledge in engineering can complement a lot the physicist point of view and the other way around it will take you more time to complete credits in a university though i think all fields of engineering can benefit from physics majors and physicists get more down to earth it would be nice if physics pensum included topics like administration operations research marketing… it seems unrelated to physics but one gets to be boss someday and has to learn the hard way 15,513 views 4,628 views 354,589 views 1,343 views 1,181 views 8,153 views 772 views 2,083 views 9,646 views 1,304
