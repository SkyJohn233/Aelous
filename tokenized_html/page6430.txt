sharepoint chuvash.eu chunky universe of vigourous astonishing sharepoint i have read and followed this awesome post getting spfx working in visual studio online by spdavid i got my fingers and tried that guide out this worked good i spent some time though googling binging around to get rid of the ssl warnings for the remote localhost on my mac i would like to share this simple instruction on how to trust a self signed certificate from gulp-connect on mac os the implication is that the certificate is on the remote linux machine on the visual studio environment that you are connected to through the visual studio code extension the first step after you have connected and set up a project is to download the certificate it can be found in the following directory choose a folder like desktop or whatever to save it to then double click server.crt to open it in the keychain access in the keychain access locate the certificate it will have the name gulp-connect open it and enter the trust section under when using this certificate select always trust after that you might need to restart the browser but then it should stop warning you allowing custom script has its security implications but what exactly does it mean is it dangerous my colleauge daniel and me have done a little experiment there are two implications stated on ms docs to summarize we can look at that picture so the risk that user 1 the blue user intentionally or unintentionally places a script and lets user 2 the red user run this script by linking to the page that has this script the page must be in a common place let s try that let s have a little hackathon scenario the red user my colleague daniel has a site with with sensitive information he has a list called secrets the blue user me does not have access to that site the red user accidentially shares the link to the secret list now to prove the security risks with the custom script the blue user has to get the secret information to make it more visual and fun we have found a box where we have put candies and locked it with a combination lock the code the combination is stored in the secrets list the combination consists of three digits from 0 to 9 so there are 1000 possible combinations since the red user knows that he is going to be hacked he acts as normal as possible not especially suspicious and since the experiment a is a simple one we let the red user to accidentially show the link to the secrets list that can be so the blue user finds out that there is a secrets list that has the following address /sites/dailywork/lists/secrets fortunately the blue user has access to a classic site where custom script is allowed he shares that site with the red user now both the blue user and the red user have it in common then a new web part page is added with a tiny script that script makes a rest call to the secrets list and uploads the result in shared documents for the sake of simplicity a built-in document library is used an attacker would probably add a hidden list for that now to get the red user to that page the blue user adds some important information so that the red user will not become suspiciuos now it is just the matter of sending a link to the red user the red user navigates to that page and the script is executed while he is reading the information on that page the blue user gets the secret that was generated by the red user with that information the blue user has hacked the combination lock and he can now open the red box with candies for now i think it is enough with the experiment a the simple experiment we have proved that indeed security is compromised with custom script allowed a user can get confidential information from another user maybe some of you want to set up a more sophisticated experiment make sure the hacked person is warned and agrees to be part of an ethical hacking act we maybe can try more to show the importance of keeping custom script disabled and not using classic sites that have it by default custom script or denyaddancustomizepages=false is dangerous it is of course not black and white it provide the ability to have small appications directly on sites created by users but as with all other aspects of it you should know what you are doing every site with custom script is a potential trojan horse minimizing the number of classic sites and sites with custom scripts lowers the risk all the collaboration sites should be modern team sites without custom script this post is my summary and my conclusions on the path length limit in sharepoint online and onedrive path length is not the same as the url length it is the relative url i don t want to discuss whether to folder not to folder on that topic my favorite is the slide deck with the same name by bobby chang to folder or not to folder for those who need to use folders i would recommend i saw a demo of it on the european sharepoint conference in copenhagen in 2018 sebastian fouillade who showed this compared this big change with brain surgery all the urls all the connections but now it is possible today i have seen it even in my standard release tenant it is really appreciated soon it will be possible to rename misspelled sites like devlepment to development etc i also can image it will be very handy to change the url of a sharepoint site that was automatically created for a team through the office 365 group the team might have some longer name but a simpler url is often appreciated i have tried and seen that also the automatic redirects from an old site url to a new site url works now it is even more important to not to rely on the fact that mailnickname of an office 365 group and site url are the same as elio struyf describes it is not a good idea to compose a url from the group name i have used in pocs the site url to get the group id now it the amount of cases where it will work will be less i have found that the app catalog site can not get a new url neither sites with publishing features we re making it possible for sharepoint administrators to change site urls this roll out does not apply to office 365 subscriptions for edu tenants this message is associated with microsoft 365 roadmap id 56205 .how does this affect me as a global or sharepoint admin in your organization you will be able to change the url for the following types of sites previously called site collections for example if you have a site named https //contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/develpment you can rename the site to correct the incorrect spelling of development via the sharepoint admin center automatically-generated redirects will ensure that old links do not break.what do i need to do to prepare for this change there is nothing you need to do to prepare for this change but you may consider updating your user training and notifying your help desk learn more about changing a site address a non-admin user can create no more than 250 resources in azure ad that is one of the many azure ad service limits and restrictions a resource can be an app registration an office 365 group etc but i would like to discuss groups more in detail imagine the following scenario your organization has disabled office 365 group creation only it can create new groups a service account has been set up for creation of team sites the application permissions are binary either everything or nothing group.readwrite.all this service account will hit the limit very soon to prove that i have created a small script that creates 251 groups by the way just for clarification when create a new group that will also create a sharepoint site please don t try this with your real account in production the 251st request will fail directory_quotaexceeded the directory object quota limit for the principal has been exceeded please ask your ad ministrator to increase the quota limit or delete objects to reduce the used quota even if you remove it will take time to get free slots in this limit deleted azure ad resources that are no longer available to restore count toward this quota at a value of one-quarter for 30 days there is not much to do about it for app registrations you can create and assign a custom role but for groups there is no custom roles available it might be obvious but still admins do not have this limit but not all admin roles are really admins those roles are excepted those roles are not excepted i don t have time to try every admin role but i suppose only admins that can change global configuration are excepted not the reader ones since communication sites do not have an office 365 group behind the scenes a non-admin user will still be able to create such sites even after the limit is hit since my scenario for creating groups with a service account does not work we need to seek workarounds and solutions that is the best one if users can create groups/sites by themselves then none of this would be a problem but still in my scenario there is a business requirement to control the creation of groups that is exactly the opposite of my scenario this gives that application full access to all groups and files this means that application can access all group-connected sharepoint sites as well if we also had groups permissions for custom roles then we could do the same way as with app registrations today 2019-10-25 there are only permissions for applications if there were a permission for only creating groups that would solve the problem there is a similar role user.invite.all it allows only invitations not editing all users if there were a switch for the 250-limit per user that would also solve the problem granting sharepoint admin would solve the problem but at what price that is safer than application permissions group.readwrite.all since you need to actively add this account to the groups in order to read all the files but this is still less secure than just a non-admin account if we had account 1..100 and we used every account 250 times theoretically it should work but it is a cumbersome process you need to keep track of how many groups an account as created or having the right error handling how should the password be kept safely should the accounts be removed when they have reached the 250 limit to overcome the limits and the ungranularity in the built-in permissions in office 365 one way to solve it would be a tiny but a dedicated and secured service for creation of groups and sites it would still need the hefty group.readwrite.all application permissions but making it do the only thing and do it right would mitigate the risks it could be a simple azure function that few have access to that could be just a couple of lines of code ett nytt tips på svenska det finns en webpart i sharepoint online snabbdiagram när du har lagt till ett snabbdiagram kan du skriva välja mellan stapel och cirkeldiagram resultatet får du direkt det går att visualisera data från en sharepoint-lista det är inte så mycket mer komplicerat men det öppnar nya möjligheter du behöver bara hålla listan uppdaterad det finns många olika sätt att visualisera data powerbi excel diagram man skapa egna webparts men det är inte så sällan när man vill bara en liten visuell hjälp för att kommunicera ett budskap istället för att fastna på teknikaliteterna kan man snabbt smälla upp ett diagram det gör inte heller att man behöver manuellt uppdatera sidan/listan bra jobbat microsoft snabbdiagram finns bara i moderna sidor inte i klassiska sådana wikisidor webbdelssidor jag tänker använda taggen svenska för alla mina poster skrivna på svenska this is my personal list of links and thoughts on troubleshooting performance in sharepoint online every response from sharepoint online contains some health information following response headers could reveal the health jag har precis börjat med kolumnformatering bara testat det är annorlunda jag är nöjd med första resultatet även om det påminner om jslink som jag har jobbat mycket med så är det mycket lättare att sätta igång det är enklare att ändra även för en icke-utvecklare man får en början med hjälp av dokumentation av list formatting och office ui fabric icons har jag skapat en enkel formatering som jag är riktigt nöjd med det är tre ja/nej-kolumner som ska sättas till ja under processen listan representerar beställningar ja/nej-kolumnerna är actions för den som tar emot beställningar nej är en tom röd cirkel ja är en full grön cirkel du kan se koden här det är lätt som en lek att börja med det är där för en citizen developer en användare ägare på siten kan lätt sätta upp mer visuella vyer man behöver inte längre uppdatera jslink-attributet i kolumnen eller vyn programmatiskt man behöver inte stoppa in en script editor webpart med lite meckande av json kan mycket anpassas json som man ändrar valideras direkt om det skulle bli fel att det inte visar något värde i kolumnen går det lätt att nollställa formateringen jag hade lite problem först med att sätta in alla element på sin rätta plats i json-strukturen då kändes det bra att kunna ta bort det snabbt innan man fortsätter att experimentera sammanfattningsvis kan jag säga att det är en intressant och uppskattad funktion i sharepoint för enklare vy-visualiseringar som är lättare att sätta upp och ta bort p.s vad tycker du om att jag skriver på svenska om du vill ha mer innehåll på min blogg på svenska lämna en kommentar today i will share a short script for getting totals from a list view in sharepoint imagine this scenario you have set up a list view with totals and you want get the totals every day for statistics or some other reasons instead of getting all items and/or fiddling around with camlqueries there is a better and quicker way list.renderlistdata this combined with a tip from piyush k singhs blog post get aggregate values i came up with an idea to read the viewxml from an existing view and retrieve the totals in my case count and sum enough talking let s take a look at the code the good part of that approach is that you can let your view evolve over time and work together with colleagues on that your script does not need an update every time you change the view the only thing it alters is the rowlimit that s for better performance why load 30 or more list items when 1 is enough i have tested it in sharepoint 2013 and sharepoint online this post is about the default language of a new site in sharepoint online there are some pros and cons of using english as the default language for non-english sites in my case i want to know what is better for swedish users today when you create a site english is pre-selected in the form you have to choose swedish actively when you create a team the underlying sharepoint site will have english as the default language there are a couple of advantages of starting from english the disadvantages are if you keep the general sort order the swedish åäö will be treated as aao which means ö-words that are expected to be in the end of a list will show up in the middle an important setting for business and the bad part is you need to change it to finnish/swedish sort order before you add an indexed column or a built-in list e.g tasks that adds indexed columns for a swedish site a site where the majority of users are swedish who expect the right sort order the very first thing you have to do is to change the sort order and also the time zone and 24h clock and monday as the first day of week etc once you get an indexed column no matter if you have zero list items you will get an error like this older posts follow me on google+ vulacv чăвашла вулаттаракан сайт and going crazy doing it microsoft 365 sharepoint and azure nikander
