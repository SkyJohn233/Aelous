You can donate and support Anna's outstanding efforts here:  http://www.annaslittleheroes.org Earlier this year on Friday 15 August, World Cycling Track Champion and Little Heroes Foundation ambassador Anna Meares took to the stage and shaved her head to raise vital funds for Little Heroes Foundation's seriously ill children. Anna's head shave event,  was broadcast live on Today Tonight. The money Anna raised has kickstarted our $4 million robotic rehabilitation centre at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital. This is the video from the event. Loading...     Loading...     Loading...     Loading...     Loading...             Working...             Loading playlists...
