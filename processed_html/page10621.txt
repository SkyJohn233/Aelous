Vo-tech director leader tells task force how important Quincy center is - Herald-Whig - By DON O ' BRIEN  Herald-Whig Staff Writer  Mark Pfleiger took full advantage of a rare opportunity Monday afternoon.   Pfleiger, the second-year director of the Quincy Area Vocational Technical Center, let members of a state-appointed task force know what he thought about the value of centers like the one he runs at Quincy High School.   "I know we save lives in these classes," Pfleiger said.    Members of the Area Career and Technical Education and Vocational Centers Task Force got to hear the story of a Quincy High School student who was struggling with his class load. The student took a class through the Quincy vo-tech center, and it turned him around. He ' s going to graduate this spring and has a college scholarship lined up.   "He found that motivation to do well," Pfleiger said. "That ' s what our programs provide. For a lot of kids, these programs bring relevance to them."   For some students, taking the vocational-technical classes is becoming more and more difficult. While more than 80 percent of the Quincy center ' s students come from QHS, the rest come from nine area high schools that the center serves -- Central in Camp Point, Liberty, Seymour in Payson, Unity in Mendon, Griggsville-Perry in Griggsville, Pittsfield, Pleasant Hill, Western in Barry and Southeastern in Augusta. Pfleiger said transportation is becoming more of an issue for students at those schools.   "We had three students that came from a good distance away," he said. "They were from Western down in Barry, which is the better part of an hour ' s drive up here. They came religiously and were great students. They came all first semester, but the second semester came around and they said they couldn ' t afford the gas anymore. They were car-pooling and the whole bit. They were doing everything they could do to make it work.    "When the district couldn ' t afford to pay for them to transport them up here and the parents just couldn ' t do it, they had to drop this semester. It was really unfortunate."   Task force member Robert Knutson, director of the Mount Vernon Area Vocational Center, said students in rural areas who can ' t take vocational-technical courses at their schools are becoming more isolated because their school districts can ' t afford to send them to area centers like the one in Quincy.   "If they don ' t have that opportunity and find something else for themselves, what are they going to find?" Pfleiger asked. "What are they going to do?"   The Quincy center, which opened in 1973, is one of 24 vocational-technical centers in Illinois. According to statistics provided by the Illinois State Board of Education, more than 12,000 students across the state accessed vocational-technical courses through vocational centers. Students who took at least two credit hours at those centers were found to be more likely to graduate than those who didn ' t take those classes.   At the Quincy center, students who took at least one class had a 94.5 percent graduation rate compared with an 86.3 percent rate as a whole for QHS.   Monday ' s meeting was the third of seven public sessions the task force will hold statewide this year. The group was formed in June 2012 through a joint resolution of the Illinois General Assembly. The task force is gathering public input about funding, transportation and support for the centers throughout the state.   The Quincy vo-tech center gets its funding through federal and state resources. Meetings like Monday ' s, Pfleiger said, will help put a face on the centers when legislators decide to talk about funding.   "We wanted to start a groundswell of dialogue at the leadership level so those folks aren ' t just making decisions in the dark," he said. "If they do cut funding, here ' s the impact."   -- dobrien@whig.com/221-3370 Existing subscribers can sign in below.
