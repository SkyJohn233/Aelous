Thankfully, we now have much data available to decipher it for everyone. I’ve simplified it for those who don’t want to delve deeper in 3 steps below, and expanded it using my case subsequently. Step 1:  Check if you are eligible from the  admission criteria[2017–19]. Step 2:  Use  IIM-A  Criterion to input your acads data in the “IIM-A” sheet and the corresponding CS cutoff(because of different ACs) from  Shortlisting Criteria for IIM-A [2017–19] and you’ll obtain the required CAT scaled score. Step 3:  Check... A2A The question that haunts most of the people’s minds for months when they start preparing. Thankfully, we now have much data available to decipher it for everyone. I’ve simplified it for those who don’t want to delve deeper in 3 steps below, and expanded it using my case subsequently. Step 1:  Check if you are eligible from the  admission criteria[2017–19]. Step 2:  Use  IIM-A  Criterion to input your acads data in the “IIM-A” sheet and the corresponding CS cutoff(because of different ACs) from  Shortlisting Criteria for IIM-A [2017–19] and you’ll obtain the required CAT scaled score. Step 3:  Check your required percentile from  Scaled Score vs Percentile in CAT 2016 . Let me demonstrate it for your reference, considering my case. Profile 10th: 96.2% 12th: 95.0%(Science) UG: 7.17/10.0==71.7%(AC-4) Work Ex-0 months Step 1:  Yes, I’m in my final year with more than 50% marks in my Bachelors. Yes, I’m expecting above 70%ile in each section and more than 80%ile OA. And yes, I have applied for the IIM-A PGP. So I shall be ‘considered’ for further rounds. Step 2: AR=10+10+5 = >  25 Stage 1 shortlisting-Selection of exceptional performers across different disciplines Criteria 1(C1): I meet the sectional cutoffs. C2: My average percentage of 10 and 12 combined is  > 80%. C3: My percentage marks in Bachelors are  not  more than 80th percentile’s percentage marks of my AC-4 group(from the RTI file you can see it is 80.40%, I have less). So  I will not be considered for this round of shortlisting. Stage 2 shortlisting-Category wise selection after removing Stage-1 selected candidates and on the basis of merit of Composite Score(CS) I enter my AR in the excel sheet and find the  corresponding scaled score required to be 192. Step 3:  A scaled score of 192 corresponded to a  99.91–99.94%ile  in CAT 2016. There.  I needed a 99.9+%ile in CAT to get a call from IIM-A.  It wouldn’t change much this year, given the shortlisting criteria hasn’t changed and that number of candidates will remain more or less the same. These should have been the percentile required for CAT 2016. I have also assumed the highest scaled score All India to be 300(this will only give you a slightly higher required score, not less). So you’ll be on the safer side. Note: Applicable only to general category students. Should differ for others. I bear no responsibility for the little/huge variance of score/percentile that may arise because of change in this year’s data. You also need to read the above docs a little to understand the procedure. It won’t help for me to just re-iterate stuff. 8,677 Views 2,382 Views 1,618 Views 8,020 Views 3,007 Views At 100, with all sectional cut offs cleared, you ' ll get a call with a decent profile. ( For guarenteed), you might get it at a lower percentile too, all depends on your profile. p pH r auoF o A m YMYzk o E t yrOkn e PkkR d ye VX b shue y SlP Yl D LQQxs u PfliJ c Lvm k YE D Ifo u Ime c f k GjtU G Dhcg o ZF Dear Friend The minimum CAT percentile to qualify for the IIMA interview for 2018–20 session is: Know more details at -  IIM Ahmedabad Admission Criteria 2018-20: Overall CAT Cutoff 80 Percentile Hope this helps you…. 2,382 Views 817 Views 8,020 Views 1,635 Views 7,964 Views 8,677 Views 1,164 Views 3,007 Views 3,401 Views 13,703 Views 36,436 Views 13,983 Views 1,352 Views 1,618 Views 2,235 Views
