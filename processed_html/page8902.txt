For instance, rather than talking about fixed annuity rates returning 4% then showing your product at 4.15%, you should first talk about the fact that CD rates are around 2% then show the client your product that will return around 4.15%. By cueing the consumer it puts them in a mindset to accept a 4.15% return because it is much greater than a 2% return.  However when compared first to a competitors product at 4%, 4.15% doesn’t sound like such a great deal.
