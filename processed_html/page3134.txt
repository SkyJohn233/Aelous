free-food-alert Info Page free-food-alert -- Welcome to the Free-Food-Alert list! This mailing list was created to serve a simple but very important purpose: to help hungry Stanford students find free food on campus.  We have an impressive 280+ members on this mailing list, a short article in Stanford Magazine at http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2004/marapr/features/farside.html , and a plug in the Stanford Daily at http://daily.stanford.edu/tempo?page=content =16864 =0001_article .  As a member of the community you are encouraged to forward to the list any announcements about events that involve free food.  (Such events may include talks, company presentations, seminars, etc.)  Remember that one person’s leftovers is another person’s lunch and dinner. We also now have an associated blog, which is a record of all posts to this list for members who want the free food without the extra email.  It can be found at http://free-food-alert.blogspot.com As a service to this community of free food seekers, you are encouraged to follow this template: ---------Suggested template -------------- Subject:  [Location]:[Short Description of Food] Body:  -Location and event (if any),  -Description of Food,  -Number of servings (if known), -Time you last saw the food, -Length of time it will be available (if known), -Estimate on age of the food... -Tips and Notes (i.e. “Bring Tupperware containers to carry it away!” or “Bring your Stanford ID if you want to make it past the guards!”) ---------End suggested template ------------ As a courtesy to others on this list, if you discover (or are part the reason) that the announced free food is no longer available, please let the rest of the list know so we can put the deal to rest. Without each other, you and I would starve!  (Or at least we would have to resort to not-so-free-food.  And I would rather starve.)  Long live Free Food! If you have any questions, please send them to free-food-alert-owner@lists.stanford.edu.  To see the collection of prior postings to the list,      visit the  free-food-alert  Archives .
