What do you guys use to plan your class schedule every semester? : aggies I don &# x27;t go to Texas A & M and am wondering if there are any course calendars or schedulers created by students or the school that you use to figure out what classes you are going to take every semester. Thanks! If you &# x27;re talking about scheduling per semester I &# x27;ve used  this . But I stumbled upon  this  A & M specific one as well Thanks! Pair the Aggie Scheduler up with  http://jippylong12.xyz/tamuFGD/  and you have just about the easiest way to schedule classes ever. I did this last semester and couldn &# x27;t be happier. I use google calendar.  I create a new calendar for each potential section (XXXX-###-###), then pick a week later on, and manually enter the class times for each section.  Using the bar on the left, I show/hide individual calendars/sections until I find a combination of sections that works. As for tools to help decide between professors, I use  http://anex.us/grades/  and  http://jippylong12.xyz/tamuFGD/ A lot of people use the grade distribution that &# x27;s available on the registrar &# x27;s website. It lists the professor &# x27;s and the grade distributions for all the classes. 25.4k Members 172 Online May 12, 2009 Cake Day
