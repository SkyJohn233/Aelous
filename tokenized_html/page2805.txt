dragonlance krynn reborn the neverwinter vault some repeating dialogue after quest completion but well put together otherwise the story however is pretty basic like a beginner 's quest i like that story and scripting but on other hand it seems that the dialogs are not fulfillent with quest-line i 've already killed an elemental mage in cave got reward and on another conversation the aasomeone tries to give me this quest again another thing are druids and their altar i 've grabbed the gobln head which in fact was a hobgoblin neverthless and gave it to druid 's leader unfortunatelly it does n't end the quest with forest purification finally i 'm not able to pass the south bridge areatransition it does nothing i think it took me an half an hour to finish the story 20 minutes exactly i like that the henchman has an inventory my henchmans does n't and i do n't know why
