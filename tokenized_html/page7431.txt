redskins updated predictions for 53-man roster after preseason week 2 page 6 philadelphia pa â€“ december 26 trent williams 71 of the washington redskins walks off the field at the end of the first half against the philadelphia eagles on december 26 2015 at lincoln financial field in philadelphia pennsylvania photo by mitchell leff/getty images the offensive line has been a major weakness for the redskins through two weeks of the preseason there s no question about it their top unit has played poorly against starters from other teams and they have to step up their performance in order to play better however despite the poor play of the starters the redskins may elect to carry just eight linemen going into the season opener the reasoning is simple while the starters have not been great the backups have not shown much either so the redskins may decide that some other positions are more important to have depth at and that could cause them to carry less on the offensive line they also could elect to sign a veteran to occupy the ninth slot and nick mangold is a good option in the wake of spencer long s injury it does help the redskins cause that backup ty nsekhe is such a good tackle nsekhe is one of the best swing tackles in the league and if the redskins really felt the need to replace shawn lauvao in the starting lineup nsekhe could possibly play guard or shift trent williams inside to help the team out the most notable bubble name of this group is arie kouandjio the third year guard was expected to step up and possibly win a starting spot but he has instead regressed badly kounadjio seems likely to get cut by the redskins they simply don t need an unreliable guard to be a backup for them right now it seems more likely that they would keep an undrafted rookie like kyle kalis however they could probably get him to the practice squad and call him up if needed during the season this is going to be a position to watch in preseason week 3 with the bad performance thus far jay gruden is going to be looking to find players who can step up and play well if a backup shines that may be enough to win him a spot on the team s initial 53-man roster landover md \u2013 january 01 quarterback kirk cousins 8 of the washington redskins hands the ball off to teammate running back rob kelley 32 in the first quarter at fedexfield on january 1 2017 in landover maryland photo by patrick smith\/getty images \/p \n\t\t\t\t\t \/div \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \/div \n\t\t\n things are becoming clearer in the washington redskins roster battles here\u2019s a look at our updated predictions for the final roster after week 2 of the preseason \/h2 \n making the roster cut to 53 is never an easy thing for any nfl team in the modern nfl it\u2019s even harder with the elimination of the cut to 75 a new rule as of this year teams are allowed to carry 90 players until it is time to pare down the roster to 53 because of this all teams including the washington redskins are able to get a longer look at some of their guys on the roster bubble \/p \n at the same time the lack of a first cut gives teams a chance to collect more and more observations and data about players while that could be a good thing on the surface it could also make decisions difficult if they are trying to find 37 players to cut instead of cutting 15 in one go and then 22 in another to put it simply it\u2019s not easy to create a perfect 53-man roster \/p \n just over a week ago we took a crack at predicting the redskins 53-man roster \/a for the first time our projections were basically balanced on both sides of the ball with equal numbers of offensive and defensive players however after preseason week 2 it is going to be harder for the redskins to pass up on keeping some of the defensive players that they have on the roster \/p \n without further ado here\u2019s a look at our updated predictions for the redskins 53-man roster post preseason week 2 \/p \n \n \n next \/span \n quarterbacks\n \/a \n \/div
