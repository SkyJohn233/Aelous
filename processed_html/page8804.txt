Today people are measuring their effect on the environment by looking at their carbon footprint. Carbon is one of the greenhouse gases most responsible for warming Earth’s climate. Your carbon footprint measures the total amount of greenhouse gases you emit directly and indirectly. Cars, factories, and home heating all rely on fuels that release carbon into the atmosphere. The manufacturing of products you use, like food and clothing, does, too. When people know how big their carbon footprints are, they can make changes that improve their own lives and the environment. {    "@context": "http://schema.org",    "@type": "ImageObject",    "contentUrl": "https://slideplayer.com/slide/9338953/28/images/3/How+big+is+your+footprint.jpg",    "name": "How big is your footprint",    "description": "Today people are measuring their effect on the environment by looking at their carbon footprint.

Ozone is a form of oxygen that has three oxygen atoms in each molecule  instead of the usual two. Ozone in the atmosphere absorbs some of the harmful radiation from the sun.  The ozone layer is a layer of the upper atmosphere. It is about 15 to 30 kilometers above Earth’s surface. It protects people from the effects of too much ultraviolet radiation. {    "@context": "http://schema.org",    "@type": "ImageObject",    "contentUrl": "https://slideplayer.com/slide/9338953/28/images/4/How+does+the+ozone+layer+protects+Earth.jpg",    "name": "How does the ozone layer protects Earth",    "description": "Ozone is a form of oxygen that has three oxygen atoms in each molecule instead of the usual two.

Ozone is constantly being made and destroyed as part of the ozone cycle. The amount of ozone in the ozone layer is decreasing, creating an ozone  hole. Scientists determined that the major cause of the ozone hole is a group of  gases called CFCs. CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons, are human-made gases  that contain chlorine and fluorine. CFCs were used in many household products. Most uses of CFCs were  banned in 2000. Scientists predict that if the ban on ozone-depleting substances is  maintained, the ozone layer will gradually recover. {    "@context": "http://schema.org",    "@type": "ImageObject",    "contentUrl": "https://slideplayer.com/slide/9338953/28/images/6/How+does+the+ozone+layer+protects+Earth.jpg",    "name": "How does the ozone layer protects Earth",    "description": "Ozone is constantly being made and destroyed as part of the ozone cycle.

Global temperature changes affect regions differently. Rising global temperatures cause some regions to get very warm and dry. Severe droughts cause some lands to become deserts, and this process  leads to food shortages.
