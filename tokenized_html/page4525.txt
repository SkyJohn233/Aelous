samsung j6300 review ue32j6300 expert reviews sign up for our daily newsletter header-social secondary menu expensive but this is the ultimate set those who don t have room for a big tv screen size 32in native resolution 1,920x1,080 video inputs 4x hdmi component composite tuner freeview hd dimensions 428x370x91mm 32in tvs can typically be bought for less than £150 so when samsung pitches a £349 32in full hd internet-connected set it 's making a statement clearly customers without much space still want all the features of a big tv the j6300 is also available in larger sizes 40in ue40j6300 48in ue48j6300 and 55in ue55j6300 models usually we 're happy to extend a recommendation from one set to those of similar sizes if the panel used is essentially the same however with 4k sets now widely available the full hd resolution here may not translate up to larger models in terms of value for money or image quality the curved screen makes an immediate impact with angled bezels drawing your eyes into the screen but the rest of the tv does n't look or feel particularly premium the plastic stand has a pleasing curved shape but it lacks the refined design of some of samsung 's higher-end models the whole set is very chunky too and really does n't feel like a high-end tv it 's a shame because it performs like one samsung has always managed to nail out-of-the-box image quality and does even better with a selection of excellent presets to suit all tastes we found the dynamic preset mode to be the best one-size-fits all for brightly lit broadcast tv it 's perhaps a little bright for watching at night so you 'll want to drop the brightness a little we found natural a better fit for atmospheric movies with dark scenes there 's a dedicated sports button on the remote that boosts brightness and contrast and gives everything a bit more colour particularly enhancing grass it looks a bit artificial but does wonders for making moving objects stand out and it also boosts the volume on commentary and crowd noise too we found it worked well on both football and motor racing although it 's either on or off it would have been nice to have a little more control over exactly what it does for those who like to tweak things a little there 's an advanced settings menu that lets you make changes to blacks and flesh colour white balance and contrast you can also configure image enhancement options including colour temperature digital noise reduction and frame interpolation noise reduction is n't so important on smaller tvs unless you 're sitting very close and we 're not entirely convinced the noise reduction on this tv is particularly effective playing around with the settings we were never really able to make sd content look much better than with noise reduction switched off all the settings you make can be applied to just one source or to every source we 'd recommend the former as it means you can make fine adjustments without ruining your other input sources out of the box colour coverage is great at 91 of the srgb gamut while contrast is very high at 3434:1 reasonably low black levels of 0.6cd/m2 mean darker scenes in games and films are still easily viewable with plenty of detail even if your lights are switched on the only thing we missed was the ability to tweak individual colours to absolutely perfect the tv 's performance it 's a shame although not entirely unsurprising to see on a cheaper tv viewing angles are very wide and while we 're not entirely convinced the curved screen adds a lot to its performance we could n't find a reasonable angle where we were n't able to watch the tv happily samsung s auto motion plus frame interpolation is highly configurable with three presets and a custom mode that lets you balance between blur or judder reduction and led brightness we found little need for the most configurable options the smooth preset was able to iron out the most obvious juddering in our blu-ray test footage if you 're planning on hooking up a games console to one of the four hdmi ports you 'll want to make sure game mode is switched on it 's hidden in a hard-to-find menu in the system area of the settings area and even though it 's not linked to any of the picture quality settings switching it off will only turn it off for the source you currently have selected with game mode off input lag is a disappointing 127ms but with it switched on it drops to 48ms this still is n't ideal and is n't the lowest lag figure we 've seen but for most games it will be fine the speakers meanwhile are very impressive while a proper soundbar or speaker system will eclipse it if you 're going to be using it as a secondary tv you 'll be impressed with how well bass is served up while dialogue music and sound effects all get room to breathe broadcast tv sounds great and while complex audio arrangements in films will sound a little flat this tv 's audio performance is extremely creditable there are four hdmi ports and a set of composite and component connectors on the back of the set you get an optical s/pdif port for speaker systems and there 's also a 3.5mm port for wired headphones three usb ports are also included and they 're all on the right-side of the tv so you can easily connect and disconnect peripherals like usb sticks and keyboards three of the hdmi ports are on the side too making them easily accessible as we 've come to expect samsung 's smart tv interface is excellent it comes pre-loaded with a few apps including bbc iplayer and all 4 there 's an app store full of video and radio catch-up applications including netflix youtube amazon instant and itv player plex is also available if you want to set up a dlna server at home the interface is n't the smoothest we 've come across despite the set using a quad-core processor slight stutter and lag is manageable though and it would n't put us off buying the tv the samsung ue32j6300 is very expensive for a 32in tv but if it 's going to be your main tv or you really want a great bedroom tv it 's worth every penny it 's easy to set up and get great image quality out of the box while also allowing you to tweak enough settings to get exactly what you want out of each input source for other options see our best tvs and buying guide buy now from amazon the best ps4 controllers the best board games for all ages
