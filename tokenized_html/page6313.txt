jenelle schmidt author king s warrior november 28 2019 h appy thanksgiving to all my american readers friends and family and for those of you outside the u.s.a. happy third-to-last day of november and to everyone let the christmas decorating and music commence i love christmas it s my favorite time of year i love thanksgiving too don t worry this isn t me hopping on the skip thanksgiving ride today is one of my favorite days of the year and i hope yours has been lovely and restful and filled with good food and quality conversations and peace and that you have spent some time reflecting on those things you are truly grateful for i know i have but i have a christmas gift for you and i couldn t wait one more second to share it with you i m far too excited about it like many of you i have a lot of favorite christmas traditions every year we watch all our favorite christmas movies throughout the month of december the kids and i put up our jesse tree and hang ornaments each day we buy a new lego star wars advent calendar each year because we re nerds i also pack up all the christmas picture books when we put away the decorations so that i can pull them out wrap them up and put them under the tree and each night in december the kids pick one out to unwrap and read together as a family another tradition we started last year was jolabokaflod an icelandic tradition in which everyone gifts each other books and we open them on the morning of christmas eve and then spend the rest of the day reading our new books and eating chocolate could there be a better tradition anyone has ever come up with anywhere it was awesome and we are definitely doing that again this year this year i m so excited to be able to include my christmas picture book in the mix of these traditions a few of you know that one of my dreams is to narrate my own audio-books yes this is why there is no audio version yet because making an audio book requires a few things i don t have access to namely time and quiet but it s on my list but in spite of my lacking the time/quiet/nice microphone that i need to narrate one of my longer fantasy novels a portion of that dream has come true for me this year anyway and today i would like to present it to you as an early christmas present i hope you enjoy it jenelle schmidt 10 subscribers subscribe twas an evening in bethlehem audio presentation info shopping tap

jenelle 14 comments categories featured giveaway images my books snippets twas an evening in bethlehem december 16 2019 i f you ve been following me for any amount of time you probably already know that i published a christmas-themed picture book a few months ago but today i thought it would be fun to give you a special back page pass as it were to see how this little book came together because the story behind the story is one that is full of surprises and i hope that it might be full of encouragement as well sometimes there is no super-spiritual feeling that comes when god works sometimes there is no special calling. sometimes god simply works through you and around you and uses the gifts he s already given you and you don t even know that he s doing anything until he s done sometimes god surprises you i don t say this to downplay in any way those times when god calls you specifically to do something those moments definitely exist this just wasn t one of them when god moved our family to wisconsin from north carolina in october of 2015 far away from family or anyone we knew i was already an author i had published two fantasy fiction novels and was working on the third writing was not a new talent or skill for me when god led us to chippewa valley bible church in may of 2016 my husband derek joined the media team because of this he got to know our worship director jodi he came home one thursday after rehearsal and told me enthusiastically that jodi loves fantasy fiction you should get to know her better. he was a little worried about me because i hadn t made many friends yet he knows that i am shy and introverted and so he figured he had found someone that i at least had two things in common with a love of jesus and a love of fantasy jodi and i did become friends after that and she even read my books throughout my adult life one of the things i have struggled with at times is a feeling that the gifts god gave me aren t really needed by the church reading is my super power but it s hard to use that on behalf of others and while god has given me a talent for writing he s also given me a deep love of fiction which isn t usually something the church generally asks for so when jodi contacted me in the spring of 2017 and asked if i might be interested in writing a small skit for easter i gladly agreed to do so it was nice to feel that my talent was wanted on september 11 of that same year jodi sent me the following email would you have time to write something for our christmas eve service i d like to have a christian version of twas the night before christmas there are some okay ones online but they don t have the same cadence and pattern of the original well either that or they re really downers i m looking for something that follows the cadence of the original so at some point has an alternative to on dasher on dancer etc is that something that would be doable for you just to give you an idea of the service our theme is christmas surprises and throughout advent we ll be looking at the surprising things god did at christmas for the christmas eve service i d like it to be like christmas through the eyes of a child with all the wonder and excitement and surprise and of course we ll focus that towards jesus since he is what gives us hope in the season once again i jumped at the chance to help out and set about thinking about what i could write it took a while a month later i was still spinning my wheels with absolutely no ideas about what i could write as i was trying to think of something at times praying for inspiration i turned to my husband for help we often chat about my books and he helps me work through those awful moments of writer s block derek asked if i had to write it from the perspective of a modern-day child which was what i had been attempting to do because i knew that was the theme of jodi s christmas song that she had written for the service he asked could i perhaps write the story from the perspective of a child who might have been there on that first christmas eve night maybe a young shepherd or what if the innkeeper had a child i liked the idea asked jodi what she thought and she liked it too after that the story came together in kind of a whirlwind i wrote all fourteen stanzas in a single afternoon while the kiddos were taking naps i read what i d written to derek later that night and we did a very small amount of tweaking and editing the next morning i sent it to jodi and kind of figured that d be the end of it however jodi and god weren t quite done meanwhile unbeknownst to me jodi reached out to another lady in our church that she knew had a talent for painting and drawing and asked if she had time to do a few illustrations for this poem i had written she said yes and created four pictures to go with the poem so that they could put them up on the projector while someone read the story to the kids up on stage sierra also didn t really see her painting as a gift per se but rather a hobby that she enjoys and doesn t get much time for the wednesday before christmas i was at church helping with awana when jodi came over to me with a huge excited smile on her face and handed me something it was a book she had taken the words and the illustrations and gotten them printed and bound at walmart so that the person reading the story on stage later that week could have something to hold and make it feel more like storytime for the kids as i held the book and showed it to derek the thought suddenly struck me that i ve just written a children s book that was a surprise writing a children s book is something i ve always wanted to do but hadn t because i have zero artistic talent when it comes to drawing or painting and that s kind of important if you re going to write a picture book since in my opinion most children s picture books rely heavily on the actual pictures derek and i knew that if we wanted to actually turn it into a children s book we would need a few more illustrations and i had no idea if that was something sierra would be interested in i also wasn t exactly sure how to go about walking up to this person i didn t really know to broach the subject of publishing a book together so i kind of hemmed and hawed my way about sort of trying to work up the courage to talk to her about it but god took care of that too after the book was read up on stage during the service sierra and jodi both had numerous people come up to them and ask where they could purchase the book at the time that was not possible since we hadn t actually published the book yet and getting it printed at walmart was pricey sierra actually approached me and asked if i had any interest in publishing the book and told me that she had no idea how to go about that she didn t know that i had already published books so it was a surprise to her that i already had that aspect of things pretty much figured out she agreed to do five more illustrations for the book and we set out to put the book together honestly the road to get this picture book written and published has been one i know i can take absolutely no credit for hindsight being 20/20 and all that i can definitely look back now and see god s hand in every step of the design from moving us across the country to wisconsin which was an answer to prayer in and of itself to helping me find a friend to planting the idea for the story itself in my husband s mind i can t even claim that he sent the inspiration directly to me jodi s original idea my words sierra s beautiful paintings and my husband s hours spent on graphic design and figuring out how to turn all the pieces into one single file we could upload and send to the printer every single piece of the puzzle has been perfectly fitted together to result in this picture book being created you may not know what your gift is or how it can be useful to others but 1 peter 4:10-11 has become a key verse for both sierra and myself throughout this process and i hope that you can find encouragement in it as well 10 each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others as faithful stewards of god s grace in its various forms 11 if anyone speaks they should do so as one who speaks the very words of god if anyone serves they should do so with the strength god provides so that in all things god may be praised through jesus christ to him be the glory and the power for ever and ever amen usually when you write a book you sit down with the intent to do just that i should know i ve written rather a few of them but this one for me will always mark the year that god gave me a special christmas surprise all my own you see i may have written the words but god authored the whole event jenelle 6 comments categories ideas my books personal publishing writing december 12 2019 d ecember is here christmas is coming it s my favorite time of the year it s a hectic busy often sniffle-filled time but it s also cozy and fun and beautiful i ve been busy with all the reading and writing and watching and living and not so much with the keeping up posting things to this blog of mine but rest assured i have not forgotten you dear reader even though i apparently haven t done an adventures episodes post since er may *whistles innocently* the blog is probably going to remain a little quiet here for the rest of the year though i hope to have my best reads of 2019 up before the end of the year as well as a fun behind the scenes story of how twas an evening in bethlehem came to be written and then i ll probably be posting fairly sparsely through january as well but after january comes everybody s favorite thing february is fantasy month i m working on some plans for making this the best fantasy month ever and if you have any ideas please feel free to pitch them my way so what have i been up to this past couple of months i ve been reading up a storm this year i originally set my goodreads reading goal at 35 books for the year knowing how much writing i had to get done but then i passed that somewhere in july so i bumped my goal up to 50 and so far this year i ve read 60 books and so many of them have been exceptional but i ll save my fangirling for my actual best reads of 2019 post the most notable things we ve watched in the latter half of the year have been two-fold ford vs ferrari halfway through this movie i found myself thinking the second this comes to blu-ray i m buying it by the end of the movie i had not changed my mind this doesn t happen very often i generally reserve judgment until i ve seen the credits roll but this movie was fantastic in many ways it reminded me of miracle and in others it reminded me of tucker a man and his dream both favorites of mine there was so much heart to this movie it s a true buddy movie and i loved the friendship depicted between carol shelby and ken miles i also loved ken miles family his wife and son were just fantastic all of the protagonists were genuinely likable which doesn t mean they didn t have their flaws but i couldn t help but root for them the only criticism i have is that there is a bit more swearing than i would have preferred including one f-word and the movie was a bit mis-titled as it really felt more like it ought to have been called ford vs ken miles but other than that this movie was absolutely beautiful the mandalorian with the advent of disney+ we went ahead and subscribed as we were kind of looking for a way/reason to ditch netflix anyway which we are planning to do as soon as we finish watching miraculous ladybug which was supposed to be on disney+ according to all the advance lists anyway i ve already posted my reaction to the first episode of the mandalorian suffice to say that this star wars western has continued to steal my heart with every new episode it is fantastic and beautiful and it is everything i ve been wanting from the live-action star wars franchise since george lucas announced he was making prequels and then did what he did with them if you have disney+ and haven t watched the mandalorian i highly recommend it somehow it manages to beautifully capture all the essence of the original trilogy while telling a completely unique-to-the-star-wars-franchise story who dahthunk not much else of note when it comes to watching things we also recently watched star wars the very original original in high def it was awesome han shot first and all that we are such nerds and we watched solo again and liked it just as much the second time around except they should have introduced xixor and black sun at the end instead of relying on darth maul yet again seriously we don t love him that much guys also how is he alive i know this was explained in the cartoons i still don t buy it and if maul is alive then in my mind han solo has every right to still be alive as well hmph derek and i are re-watching all of stargate sg-1 and will then probably move on to atlantis we ve been watching star trek voyager with the hobbits i ve watched a couple of ridiculous and girly christmas movies the knight before christmas and another cinderella story christmas both of which were sappy and ridiculous christmas knight was actually quite good even derek enjoyed it more than he thought he would we also watched the new grinch cartoon with benedict cumberbatch i have mixed feelings about it they really nailed the first half of the movie but the ending was one of those places where i felt like man they just missed it and that disappointment kind of detracts from the entire experience will i watch it again probly the kids loved it will it make it onto my christmas movies we must watch every year list not a chance after finishing up summer princess at the beginning of july i sent it to my amazing editor and dove back into writing towers of might and memory the fifth and final book in my fantasy/gaslamp series the turrim archive actually there s even a little bit of actual science in it i asked derek the other night so since there is actual science tech in my story that could work can i call it sci-fi he said no very definitively to which i asked science fantasy and he kind of tilted his head back and forth and said okay that could work so science-fantasy-gaslamp this story refuses to stay neatly in a single genre so i m embracing the madness and trying to see how many niches i can work in without actually doing it on purpose before summer princess took over my life i had struggled through 31,000 words of towers i added another 3k at the end of july and then forced myself to take the entire month of august off from writing in september i wrote approximately 8,875 words mostly bumbling around and feeling as though i was ramming my head against a wall in october i wrote practically nothing i was extremely discouraged with the entire series feeling overwhelmed by the task i had set before myself and questioning if i should even keep trying at all when my mom came to visit later in october she watched the kids one evening while derek and i went out to have an outlining/book planning discussion and he provided some massive help with the issues i d been having as well as encouragement to keep going and that i could in fact finish this book by the end of the year as you know if you read my nano update posts i added approximately 33,000 words to towers in the first three weeks of november then had to take a break for thanksgiving and family time this month so far i ve added another 20,000 words to the story in only 11 days and only have about 25,000 left to go i ve been writing up a storm and inspiration has been plentiful so i think i can actually finish this book before the new year fairly accurate depiction -d as i ve been writing a lot i ve been listening to a lot of music mostly christmas music mannheim steamroller for the win but also quite a bit from the piano guys lindsey sterling william joseph and some epic celtic music mixes like these and i just discovered this one recently lots going on here this fall we traveled across the country and visited family in washington d.c. and dear friends whom we consider family in north carolina at the beginning of august we ve had some family come and visit in october and for thanksgiving there have been some unexpected medical expenses and er visits we ve begun the process of finishing our basement and i ve been taking the two oldest hobbits to go rock climbing every week one of my favorite hobbies that i haven t gotten to do in a couple of years l and n are loving it and i am enjoying getting to do something i enjoy as well our family ventured out to cut down a real tree for the first time ever and fun was had by all we got 10-12 inches of snow the week of thanksgiving and another 3-4 inches earlier this week so the holiday season has been draped in a blanket of glittering white it has also gotten bitterly cold temperatures dropping down to -11 the girls are both in our church s christmas musical this coming weekend and they are excited about that i am presenting with my illustrator at a
