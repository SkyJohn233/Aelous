River Of Stars Poem by Akiko Yosano - Poem Hunter Share this poem:                          Left on the beach Full of water A worn out boat Reflects the white sky -- Of early autumn. Swifter than hail Lighter than a feather, A vague sorrow Crossed my mind. Feeling you nearby, how could I not come to walk beneath this evening moon rising over flowering fields. It was only the thin thread of a cloud, almost transparent, leading me along the way like an ancient sacred song. I say his poem, propped against this frozen wall, in the late evening, as bitter autumn rain continues to fall. What I count on is a white birch that stands where no human language is ever heard. A bird comes delicately as a little girl to bathe in the shade of my tree in an autumn puddle. Even at nineteen, I had come to realize that violets fade, spring waters soon run dry, this life too is transient He stood by the door, calling through the evening the name of my  sister who died last year and how I pitied him! Translated by Sam Hamill  &  Keiko Matsui Gibson                          Yosano Akiko's poems both flowing free-verse and capturing tanka, are truly fantastic-  not only Japan's, but certainly one of the world's foremost female poets!  :)   I have a few of her compilations in both English and Japanese, I'd certainly recommend them (and the one this translation is from, 'A River of Stars')  to anyone interested.

(Report) Reply Yosana Akiko is one of the great lyric voices of the 20th century. In this poem she connects so many lives - birds, trees, people, desires, hopes, bitter truths. All of these live through her burning imagination, one fired by erotic passion and sustained by desires of the heart. (Report) Reply Beautiful poem. Thank you for the translation.
