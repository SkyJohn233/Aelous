powers and its capacity to detect structural shortcomings the ombudsman institution can recommend to change structures or behaviours and raise the administrative agents awareness about fundamental rights and freedoms the ombudspersons carry out investigations following a complaint or on their own initiative they are easily accessible and act as an intermediary as a constructive relay between the individual and the public bodies having the confidence of both the aggrieved person and the public body human rights suffer infringements due to insufficient legal guarantees difficulties in implementation but also because too many people are still not aware of their rights and liberties well-informed and independent ombudspersons must play an active part in counterbalancing shortcomings
