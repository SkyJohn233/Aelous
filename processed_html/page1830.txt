The Vest Lady Karen Hatton karen5282000@outlook.com ​ When it comes to your riding vests, you'll want to make sure you deck them out so that you can ride in style. Our resident seamstress, Karen, not only gets our members their premium, heavy-duty vests, but also sews the patches and does custom linings. ​ For just $5.00, we will sew your patches onto your vest. You think that's a good deal? For every patch sewn, $1.00 is donated back to the association! This means you get it back through association activities and events. Thanks Karen! ​ If you'd like to get in touch about ordering a vest or having a patch sewn on, please contact Karen below: 10" GWRRA, Black and Gold 4" GWRRA, Black and Gold GWRRA Top Rocker, Black and Gold Chapter Y Bottom Rocker 3" Chapter Y 4" Chapter Y ​ Canadian Flag Canadian Flag (with gold trim) USA Flag GWRRA 40th Anniversary 5" Honda GoldWing USA Map (with 2 markers: 1 red, 1 blue) North American Map (with 2 markers: 1 red, 1 blue) 'Just Wing It' Red 'Just Wing It' Yellow $ 18.00 $10.00 $8.00 $25.00 $12.00 $12.00 ​ $5.00 $5.00 $5.00 ​ $8.00 $22.00 $15.00 $15.00 $10.00 $10.00 If you'd like to have the Patches or Flags sewn onto your vest, our resident seamstress would be happy to do it for you. ​ For only $5.00, you can have any patch sewn onto your Chapter ON-Y vest.
