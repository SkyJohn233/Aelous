Take it from a gentleman and follow the rules of good discourse: Your ban ends at  Hey Guys what do you think about bringing back the old Rengar and I am not talking about his Q. But the Rengar when it was released, where you could heal with W, Ult would give you furacity and having a special item bonetooth. What is your opinion guys and explain why? Ps: I am not a fan of reworks at all, some of the champs are killed because of that. We ' re testing a new feature that gives the option to view discussion comments in chronological order. Some testers have pointed out situations in which they feel a linear view could be helpful, so we ' d like see how you guys make use of it. No, Old Rengar should never come back, simply because of how feast or famine his gameplay was. He either got ahead and made playing against him next to impossible, or fell behind and became next to useless. He had no middle ground and his gameplay pattern was pretty binary because of it. And because I ' m a sucker for this stuff, what champions were killed because of their reworks? No. And no explanation is needed. His initial kit was too over the head. There were no warnings on his ult, no vision range so enemy can detect you, your radar vision on enemies in ult was immense and you could stay near anyone while in stealth without them having an idea. The boost in armor and magic resist made him too tanky for an assasin that volatile. You could stack savagery 3 times which made him impossible to deal with. And if you consider in combo with Sword of the Divine.... Let ' s say his bola strike, point-and-click, was bearable. I doubt you played him (or against it) back when he was released. I did and I spammed it when I got the chance to do. Top lane or Jungle. I am glad they tweaked his kit. NO Oh god no.  Do you realise how bad old rengar was... he was a top laner who would first blood you most matches, kill towers extremly quickly, would use ult to run away, and poke you with his E.  He was not healthy at all and needed his rework desperately. No, Old Rengar should never come back, simply because of how feast or famine his gameplay was.

In my opinion one of the examples ryze ult :( Edit: Also i don ' t think reworking champs increase pick rate. It only works for a couple of weeks, after that popularity drops. I would rather see some dmg boost instead reworking one or more skills. Oh god no.

He was not healthy at all and needed his rework desperately. well now he is not that great at top and is only played as jungler. I believe there are only few players who manage to play him top, but to be honest a decent off/tank with stun can outplay him.

He ' s still somewhat popular and still does get really strong in the late game as he ' s meant to. And they don ' t rework champs because they playrate is low. They rework when there is something fundamentally broken/unfun to play against/doesn ' t meet their intended role at all. At that point, numbers tweaks wouldn ' t do anything but neuter them. well now he is not that great at top and is only played as jungler. I believe there are only few players who manage to play him top, but to be honest a decent off/tank with stun can outplay him. Yeah... because rengar top isn’t all that healthy... once the toxic split pushing tactic got removed all he has is his first blood cheese which anyone who played back then knows how to deal with.  There isn’t any reason to bring back top lane rengar, there was nothing about it that actually was worth saving Game Champions  &  Gameplay Esports New Player Advice 🔰 Teams, Clubs and Tournaments Community and Boards Announcements Creations  &  Concepts Fan Fiction Games, Contests  &  Jokes Player Behaviour 🤝 Streams  &  Videos  Off-topic  Support  &  Feedback Bug Reports Technical Support 🔧 Service Status Red Tracker   NA Boards  ➡️ Client Discussion (NA) Dev Corner (NA) Story, Art  &  Sound (NA) Red Tracker (NA) Welcome to Champions  &  Gameplay!
