yield herein to better understand the link between oxygen supply and adenosine productivity in b. subtilis atcc21616 we sought to systematically explore the effect of do on genetic regulation and metabolism through transcriptome analysis the microarrays representing 4,106 genes were used to study temporal transcript profiles of b. subtilis fermentation in response to high oxygen supply agitation 700 r/min and low oxygen supply agitation 450 r/min the transcriptome data analysis revealed that low oxygen supply has three major effects on metabolism enhance carbon metabolism glucose metabolism pyruvate metabolism and carbon overflow inhibit degradation of nitrogen sources glutamate family amino acids and xanthine and purine synthesis inhibition of xanthine degradation was the reason that low oxygen supply enhanced adenosine production these provide us with potential targets which can be modified to achieve higher adenosine yield expression of genes involved in energy cell type differentiation protein synthesis was also influenced by oxygen supply these results provided new insights into the relationship between oxygen supply and metabolism adenosine plays an important role in biochemical and physiological processes including tissue protection and repair properties neurotransmission and anti-inflammatory 1 2 furthermore it has important medical uses in heart diseases 3 as it plays a pivotal role in heart coronary circulation and heart protection and can also be used to effectively terminate certain supraventricular tachycardia svt that involves atrioventricular av node in the reentry pathway 4 5 adenosine is produced mainly by industrial fermentation it is known that the biosynthesis of nucleotide proceeds from 5 x02032 -phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate prpp which is formed from ribose-5 x02032 -phosphate and atp the first complete purine nucleotide inosinic acid imp is synthesized through several reactions and then amp is synthesized through branched pathways adenosine is finally synthesized by dephosphorylation of amp 6 since 1968 konishi et al have reported about adenosine fermentation 7 thenceforth haneda et al put great efforts to it 8 9 they found that a xanthine auxotroph bacillus strain lacking adenase was a good adenosine producer meanwhile excess guanine a slightly acidic medium ph 5.0 x02013 6.0 and sufficient oxygen supply were optimum conditions for adenosine biosynthesis dissolved oxygen do level is an important factor in aerobic fermentation that could significantly influence bacteria 's metabolism and product yield oxygen plays an important role in biomass synthesis cell morphology biochemical degradation electron transport and atp availability 10 11 it has also been reported that oxygen can have an effect on various cell functions including carbon metabolism antibiotic production and stress response 12 the relationship between oxygen supply and fermentation productivity has been a focal point in aerobic fermentation and thus optimization of do concentration is always necessary for industrial bioprocess 13 x02013 17 our previous works also showed that oxygen supply is essential for adenosine-producing fermentation however high-level of do in the growth period restrains the overproduction of adenosine the limitation of oxygen in the early stage is beneficial for the adenosine biosysthesis 18 the intrinsic correlativity between oxygen supply and adenosine biosynthesis is still not well understood and no study has attempted to comprehensively explore the mechanisms of how oxygen is integrated into the regulatory network of adenosine biosynthesis in this work we investigated the effect of the do concentration on adenosine productivity by using comparative transcriptome analysis between adenosine fermentations with different oxygen supply the results provided new insights to better elucidate the signaling network between do level and adenosine yields and provide guides for further improvement of adenosine production in this research two batches of adenosine fermentation were conducted one with high oxygen supply agitation 700 r/min and the other with low oxygen supply agitation 450 r/min as shown in figure s1 in the early stage 0 x02013 20 h the do was at a very low level almost zero oxygen limitation at 450 r/min agitation while the do was at a much higher level at 700 r/min agitation the increasing do after 20 h suggested that the oxygen supply was enough for fermentation in the later stage adenosine yield under low oxygen supply was twice 3.63 g/l as under high oxygen supply 1.81 g/l it was supposed that oxygen limitation in the early stage may contribute to a higher adenosine yield herein transcriptome analysis was undertaken for b. subtilis to elucidate relationship between oxygen supply and adenosine yield we studied the changes in gene expression in the early stage under high oxygen supply and low oxygen supply samples were taken respectively at 12 h and 18 h of fermentation process two independent cultured replicates were performed the replicates were highly reproducible and the average coefficient of variation cv of the replicates was low x0003c 16 x00025 pair-plots of intensities revealed a high pearson correlation coefficient x0003e 0.9 p x0003c 2.2e-16 text s1 considering the samples from high oxygen supply as the control we identified 434 166 down-regulated genes 268 up-regulated genes genes at 12 h and 854 424 down-regulated genes 430 up-regulated genes genes at 18 h as significantly differently expressed more than two folds genes listed in table s1 and table s2 the transcriptome data were analyzed based on diverse sources of gene functions using two computational tools including mips http //mips.gsf.de/proj/biorel/bacillus_subtilis.html and t-profiler analysis http //www.science.uva.nl/~boorsma/t-profiler-bacillusnew/ mips functional analysis was used to assess functional category enrichments fig 1 and table s3 the up-regulated genes at 12 h exhibited a significant enrichment in functions of metabolism energy cell type differentiation and biogenesis of cellular components fig 1a other significant categories in the up-regulated genes belong to the functions of cell cycle protein fate cell rescue and subcellular localization fig 1a the significant categories of the down-regulated genes at 12 h under low oxygen supply belong to the functions of metabolism and protein with binding functions fig 1a the up-regulated genes at 18 h showed significant enrichments in functions of energy cell type differentiation and cell type localization fig 1b other significant categories belong to the functions of metabolism cell cycle protein fate protein with binding functions cellular transport cell rescue biogenesis of cellular components and subcellular localization the down-regulated genes at 18 h under low oxygen supply showed significant enrichment in cellular transport functions fig 1b other significant categories belong to functions of metabolism cell rescue interaction with the environment and subcellular localization fig 1b transcriptional factors play a central role to restructure the transcriptome responses to environmental signals the microarray data were subsequently analyzed using t-profiler to identify some transcriptional factors in response to do level change t-profiler is a computational tool that uses the t -test to score changes in the average activity of predefined groups of genes based on gene ontology categorization upstream matches to a consensus transcription factor binding motif or kegg pathway 19 it transforms transcriptional data of single genes into the behavior of gene groups reflecting biological processes in cells tf model kegg model and subtilist model in this study all transcriptome data were online performed for t-profiler analysis http //www.science.uva.nl/~boorsma/t-profiler-bacillusnew/ the gene groups with significant t values e-value 0.05 tf model are presented in tables 1 seven co-regulated gene groups were found significantly disturbed by oxygen limitation at time point of 12 h in adenosine fermentation process including sinr-negative fnr-postive rok-negative resd-postive sigf spoiiid-negative and sige among them five were related to sporulation and other cell fate sinr rok sige sigf and spoiiid two were related to oxygen metabolism fnr and resd in b. subtilis sige and sigf are both sporulation-specific sigma factors 20 while spoiiid acts as a repressor during sporulation stage iii to v 21 22 significant positive t-value of sige sigf and spoiiid table 1 demonstrated that the genes dependent on sige and sigf and genes repressed by spoiiid were overexpressed those derepressed genes in the spoiiid-negative group are almost sige-dependent table 1 sinr is a dual-functional regulator that activates motility and represses competence 23 negaive t-value of sinr-negative indicated that the genes negatively regulated by sinr were partially repressed indeed genes including yvfa sipw tasa and yvek which encode biofilm matrix were significantly repressed 24 x02013 27 rok is not only a repressor of competence but also a repressor of a number of genes that encode products with antibiotic activity in b. subtilis 28 positive t-value of rok-negative revealed that the genes repressed by rok regulator were derepressed the significantly derepressed genes included ablabcfdg-sboax and comk table 1 the sbo-alb operon was involved in subtilosin production 29 and was also directly positively regulated by resd an oxygen responser which is activated by oxygen limitation 30 fnr is a sensor of oxygen that controls genes involved in facilitating adaptation to growth under oxygen limiting conditions was induced by oxygen limitation 31 positive t-value of fnr-positive demonstrated that fnr-regulon was activated table 1 it was understandable that the genes in fnr-regulon were induced under low do level resd is required for both anaerobic and aerobic growth 32 when b. subtilis grows under oxygen limitation condition it activates genes related to nitrate respiration positive t-value of resd-positive showed that the genes of resd-postive group were activated including sbo-alb operon nasde fnr and resde table 1 the nasde genes members of nasbcdef operon which encode nadh-dependent nitrite reductase required for both anaerobic respiration and nitrogen metabolism were induced by either nitrogen limitation or oxygen limitation 33 34 eight significantly regulated gene groups were found at time point of 18 h in adenosine fermentation process including sige strcon-negative sigf spoiiid-negative sigb arfm-positive fur-negative and ccpa-negative table 1 arfm as a fnr-dependent regulator is required for expression of nasde and hmp 35 t-profiler analysis showed a strong activation of genes in arfm-regulon under low oxygen supply arfm and fnr are global transcriptional regulators that activate the expression of genes encoding many of the enzymes required for the anoxic environment ccpa is a global regulator of carbon-metabolism in b. subtilis that controls carbon metabolism and mediates carbon metabolite repression ccr 36 x02013 38 the significant negative t-value for ccpa-negative demonstrated that the genes of ccpa-negative group were repressed and indicated that oxygen limitation is beneficial for glucose metabolism in our experiment condition sigb is a general stress respose regulator that controls at least 150 genes the members of sigb-regulon are transiently induced following heat shock salt ethanol or acid stress or limitation of glucose and phosphate starvation 39 in this study we observed a significantly positive t-value of sigb under low oxygen supply which revealed that oxygen limitation activated the expression of some genes in sigb-regulon table 1 in b. subtilis iron homeostasis is regulated by fur which represses expression of genes related to siderphore biosynthesis and iron uptake proteins 40 two factors have been proved to induce fur-regulon iron limitation and oxidative stress 41 42 the negative t-value of fur-negative showed that the gene group was repressed because culture medium used in our study was a rich medium we hypothesized that the repression of fur-regulon was likely related to oxidative stress viz high oxygen supply may result in oxidative stress to some degree strcon-negative was involved in energy positive t-value indicated that genes of strcon-negative were partially derepressed obviously functions of these gene groups are consistent with enriched functional categories the average consumption rate of glucose was much higher under low oxygen supply 0.64 g/ l x000b7 h than high oxygen supply 0.16 g/ l x000b7 h consistent with the higher glucose consumption rate a number of genes involved in glucose utilization were up-regulated under low oxygen supply one glucose uptake gene glcu whose expression was dependent on a forespore late -specific sigma factor sigg 43 was overexpressed at 18 h. two genes involved in glycolysis gapa and eno were also up-regulated at 18 h. the pathways of pyruvate metabolism were promoted under the low oxygen supply the alssd operon encoding acetolactate synthase and decarboxylase was obviously up-regulated suggesting that the acetoin formation from pyruvate one of the overflow metabolism pathways that serve to excrete excess carbon from the cell was activated by oxygen limitation the operon pdhabcd which encodes pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pdh during the biosynthesis of acetyl-coa from pyruvate was also induced under the low oxygen supply moreover the genes mmgabc that involve in branched-chain amino acids and fatty acids degradation which will generate additional acetyl-coa were up-regulated acetyl-coa stands at crossroads of many metabolism pathways such as citrate synthesis acetate formation fatty acid synthesis and amino acids synthesis leucine cysteine methione sam arginine and glycine when grown under glucose-excess conditions the bacillus subtilis metabolizes a large proportion of the glucose only as far as pyruvate and acetyl-coa and subsequently convert these compounds to by-products lactate acetate and acetoin of metabolism which are excreted to the extracellular environment 44 induction of alssd and pdhabcd might suggest that the bacteria were in a glucose excess state under low oxygen supply the genes involved in glycogen synthesis glgabcdp at 12 h glgacp at 18 h were also up-regulated these results were consistent with the study of li et al whose results also revealed that low agitation promoted glucose consumption rate in pyruvate fermentation of torulopsis glabrata 45 we also investigated accumulation of pyruvate lactate acetoin and acetate at the final time point of the fermentation processes the results were well in agreement with transcriptome analysis as shown in the figure 2 concentrations of pyruvate lactate and acetate which are the metabolite products in carbon excess conditions were much higher under low oxygen supply however the genes related to utilization of other carbon sources such as frua gamp licc malp trep iolbcfh rbsacbk and citm were all down-regulated by oxygen limitation these genes were involved in the transport of fructose glucosamine lichenan maltose inositol ribose and citrate respectively the intracellular amino acids in b. subtilis were analyzed most of the amino acids were in low concentrations except glutamate which was most abundant in this study fig 3 this was also found in other bacteria for instance in b.megaterium and e. coli the principle constituent of amino acids was glutamate 46 47 the intracellular pools of amino acids especially glutamate were more pronounced under high oxygen supply at 12 h in comparison to low oxygen supply whereas the intracellular pools of amino acids were almost at the same level at 18 h fig 3 amino acids are important metabolites that must be maintained at an adequate level to serve for some physiology processes 48 lower concentration of amino acids under low oxygen supply indicated that the metabolic activity of amino acids was lower this conclusion is supported by transcriptional observation in our transcriptome data genes encoding glutamate family degradation pathways rocg rocacdf and hutug were down-regulated under low oxygen supply while genes involved in glutamate synthesis gltab were up-regulated in bacteria metabolism of glutamate modulates nitrogen-carbon metabolism balance and is well regulated through balancing distribution of 2-oxoglutarate when the bacteria were in a carbon excess state the 2-oxoglutarate will be siphoned off by glutamate synthase and catabolism of exiting amino acids will be avoided 44 up-regulation of gltab and down-regulation of rocg rocac and hutug might indicate a carbon excess state the bacteria confronted under low oxygen supply the concentration of 2-oxoglutarate was lower under low oxygen supply data not shown in microorganisms 2-oxoglutarate always indicates nitrogen deficiency while glutamine indicates nitrogen sufficiency 49 lower 2-oxoglutarate concentration might indicate that the nitrogen source was sufficient under low oxygen supply this nitrogen sufficiency was probably resulted from enhanced glutamate synthesis genes involved in histidine synthesis hisa hisfhiz chorismate aroacf were repressed at either 18 h or 12 h under low oxygen supply because histidine and nucleotide synthesis uses the same precursor phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate prpp the decrease of histidine synthesis might prompt nucleotide synthesis the genes of arginine synthesis pathway argbdfgh were up-regulated at 12 h and the isoleucine synthesis pathway genes ilvabc were up-regulated at 18 h. three genes bcd bkdaa bkdab involved in degradation of branched-chain amino acids were up-regulated at 12 h under low oxygen supply the aspb gene that involve in asparate synthesis was up-regulated at 18 h. expression of genes encoding sulfur assimilation pathway ssuabc were significantly down-regulated at 18 h under low oxygen supply a number of genes for ribosome assimilation rplmoqw rpmcdfj rpoe rpsabglm were up-regulated at 18 h. low oxygen supply also exhibited great effect on the transport of amino acids the glutamine abc transporter genes glnhmpq were significantly up-regulated under low oxygen supply while ammonium uptake gene nrga and proton/glutamate symport protein glct glcp were significantly down-regulated the purine nucleotides metabolism that directly related to adenosine production was significantly influenced by oxygen supply eight genes of the xanthine catabolism puch pucm puck pucedcba which was inhibited by nitrogen sufficiency 50 were down-regulated under low oxygen supply since the adenosine producing strain was xanthine auxotroph the repression of xanthine degradation probably benefits adenosine biosynthesis and growth to confirm this hypothesis we evaluated the effect of xanthine on adenosine production it was found that adenosine production of the fermentation processes with sufficient xanthine was continuously and stable whereas in the fermentation processes with no xanthine addition adenosine was degraded in the later period fig 4a this result strongly suggested that xanthine was important for adenosine production the significance of the effect that xanthine exerted on adenosine production was tested using one-way anova with dunnett mutiple conparisions test graphpad instat graphpad software inc. san diego ca the results showed appropriate xanthine addition could prompt adenosine production significantly text s2 moreover we analysed the xanthine concentration over the time course of fermentation process under different do conditions as shown in the figure 4b the xanthine of the medium was exhausted much earlier under high do level than low do level these results further supported that inhibition of xanthine degradation was the reason that low oxygen supply enhanced adenosine production the pura and genes of pur operon purbcdehklmnqst which are directly involved in de novo purine nucleotide synthesis were down-regulated under low oxygen supply at 12 h whereas the genes of pur operon exhibited no significantly differential expression at 18 h except purk that was over expressed moreover a gene pbug involved in hypoxanthine/guanine permease was down-regulated obviously down-expression of pur operon was a restriction for higher adenosine production under low oxygen supply the purine synthesis pathway involved of a lot of substrates such as glycine prpp formate glutamine fumarate and asparate in the transcriptome data the genes related to glutamine transport glnhmpq and asparate formation aspb were up-regulated however one gene gntz of prpp formation pathway was down-regulated at 18 h. the pur operon and pbug were repressed by purr whose activity was inhibited by prpp and activated by adenine-contained compound if the repression of pur operon and pbug by purr could be relieved adenosine yield might be higher accumulation of other adenine nucleotides at the final time point of the fermentation process was also analyzed the concentrations of adenine amp and imp were also higher under low oxygen supply figure 5 these data suggested that low oxygen supply might benefits accumulation of adenine nucleotides higher accumulation of adenine nucleotide might explain why the pur regulon was repressed under low oxygen supply coenzymes are necessary small molecules that participate in enzyme-catalytic reactions in the transcriptome-data genes thic thif thig this teni encoding thiamine synthesis pathway and genes bioa biob biod bioi biow encoding biotin synthesis pathway were up-regulated thiamine participates in the biosynthesis of acetyl-coa and pentose phosphate pathway ppp 51 while biotin was used in the glucogenesis enhancing of glucogenesis has been proved to promote ppp pathway 52 the oxygen limitation induced 14 bioenergetics-related genes including 4 atp synthase genes atpafgh and 10 cytochrome oxidase genes qoxabcd ctacdef and cydab induction of these genes showed that aerobic respiration and atp synthesis were accelerated enhancement of atp synthesis might reveal a demand for atp or an energy starvation compared to the strain under high oxygen supply it was also found the induction for cydabcd resabc and qoxabcd under anaerobic conditions 12 the result may suggest that the induction of terminal oxidases may be needed to compensate for the lack of electron acceptors enhancement of atp synthesis might reveal a demand for atp or an energy starvation compared to the strain under high oxygen supply either demand for atp or energy starvation would accelerate glucose consumption rate the nasde and narghi were all induced by low oxygen supply it is known that nasde genes encoding assimilatory nitrite reductases are induced by nitrogen limitation and oxygen limitation while narghi genes are induced by oxygen limitation only induction of nasde and narghi controlled by fnr showed that nitrite respiration is activated by low oxygen supply activation of aerobic respiration and nitrite respiration will accelerate nadh to be reoxidized to nad x0002b under low oxygen supply the glucose consumption rate was much higher the bacteria may need more nad x0002b since the concentration of total nad h is almost constant the strain need to accelerate the regeneration rate of nad x0002b from nadh from the transcription results it can be seen that sporulation and competence were promoted under oxygen limitation however no spore formation was found in the fermentation progress data not shown it has been reported that d-ribose fermentation and riboflavin fermentation using the asporogenous mutant strain it is suggested that sporulation relay may have impact on morphological phenotypes as well as metabolism d-ribose production is related to cell elongation 53 a random transposon-tagged mutagenesis screening approach has found that some overproduction mutants were related to the cell morphological differentiation genes ylon yjau phrc cote sigw flip 54 in our experiment the glucose transport gene glcu sigg dependant was up-regulated while the phrc and cote are down-regulated it is worth study whether there is any intrinsic relationship between the sporulation process and nucleotide substance including adenosine production figure 6 illustrates the postulated response network associated with low oxygen supply from the network we can conclude that low oxygen supply enhanced glucose metabolism and carbon overflow degradation of glutamate family amino acids and xanthine were repressed by low oxygen supply purine nucleotide synthesis was inhibited by low oxygen supply low oxygen supply also induced respiration although the adenosine productivity was higher under low oxygen supply there were two drawbacks in adenosine fermentation under low oxygen supply firstly although glucose consumption rate was much higher under low oxygen supply a part of the glucose consumed was used in the acetoin overflow pathway and the acetyl-coa formation pathway there was a hypothesis that inhibition of carbon overflow pathway may increase nucleotide production efficiency 55 chen et al reported that citrate is a good substrate for suppressing carbon overflow 55 herein we investigated the effect of citrate on adenosine fermentation as shown in the figure 7 citrate could increase adenosine production by 15 x00025 secondly the de novo purine nucleotide synthesis pathway was inhibited at 12 h. we supposed that if the purine nucleotide pathway could be relieved from the repression higher adenosine yield would be achieved we also investigated the effect of mg 2 x0002b thiamine and glutamate on adenosine yield mg 2 x0002b was co-transported with citrate in b. subtilis thiamine was involved glucogenesis while glutamate was substrate for glucogenic conditions mg 2 x0002b thiamine and glutamate are all beneficial for adenosine yield fig 7 although many studies have demonstrated that the dissolved oxygen level has great effect on the product yield or cell growth in fermentation few of them were involved in the mechanism of these effects of do on metabolism and genetic regulation in this study transcriptional profiling was used to assess how oxygen supply influences the metabolic and genetic regulatory network in adenosine-producing b. subtilis the results revealed that oxygen supply significantly influenced regulatory works of spoiiid-negative resd-positive rok-negative fnr-positive sinr-positive strcon-negative arfm-positive fur-negative and ccpa-negative sigb sige and sigf-dependent transcription was significantly activated by low oxygen supply through transcriptome profiling analysis we found that the limitation of oxygen significantly enhanced glucose utilization while slowing the catabolic rate of amino acids glutamate histidine and arginine these results provide new insights for a better elucidation of the signaling networks between do level and adenosine yield and provide guides for setting up optimized oxygen supply strategies this work is also a good reference for most aerobic b. subtilis fermentation for increasing metabolite productivity inhibition of xanthine degradation is the reason that why low oxygen supply enhanced adenosine production when grown under low oxygen supply xanthine degradation was somehow inhibited during the fermentation process xanthine will be exhausted at the later period and adenosine production was inhibited inhibition of xanthine delayed the time point at which xanthine was exhausted thus adenosine production was prolonged however why xanthine exhaustion limited adenosine yield is unknown we hypothesized that the reason might be due to inhibition of adaptive reversion by xanthine since the producing strain xanthine auxotroph was selected by traditional method and no genetic manipulation was used adaptive reversion of xanthine auxotroph that remove adenosine production capacity probably arise during adenosine fermentation for nutrient auxotroph nutrient sufficiency could inhibit adaptive reversion kodaira et al have reported that adaptive reversion of adenosine-producing strain was efficiently inhibited by guanine sufficiency 56 as the xanthine degradation was inhibited under low oxygen supply the time point at which xanthine was exhausted was probably delayed so the adenosine-production period was prolonged however if xanthine could efficiently inhibit adaptive reversion need to be confirmed although the adenosine production was higher under low oxygen supply enhancement of the carbon overflow pathway and inhibition of purine nucleotide synthesis were not conducive to adenosine production enhancement of carbon overflow pathway may probably reduce the carbon flow to ppp pathway which generates ribose 57 herein the citrate was used to inhibit carbon overflow and adenosine production was increased under the limitation of oxygen many genes coding for oxidases nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase were up-regulated these enzymes all were involved in recycle from nadh to nad x0002b since the concentration of nad h is almost constant in the bacteria 58 turnover of nad x0002b is very important for continuously nad x0002b supplying for bacteria induction of these genes demonstrate that nad x0002b availability was probably restricted so the bacteria tried to accelerate nad x0002b recycling this restriction of nad x0002b might be due to limited oxygen supply as it was demonstrated that oxygen limitation will increase nadh level in bacillus subtilis and activates rex-repressed genes which are activated by high ratio of nadh/nad x0002b 59 the qoxabcd ctacdef cydab narghi and nasde are all directly or indirectly positively regulated by resde dbtbs which may sense the state of menaquinone 60 induction of these genes might demonstrate that resde was activated consistently the t-profiler also revealed that resde was activated activation of resde also demonstrated that the bacteria were probably in a reduced state compared to the bacteria under high oxygen supply so we might conclude that oxygen limitation restrict nad x0002b turnover rate and resulted in a reduced state in a reduced state nad p h sufficient bacteria will prefer pathways that involve dehydrogenases that utilize nad p h to keep redox balance 61 the reduced state under oxygen limitation will probably restrict tca cycle which is the major pathway that generates nadh to keep redox balance in e. coli a reduced state increased qh2/q will activate arcab and repress the tca cycle 62 63 although the genes in the tca cycle was not repressed in this study the genes rocg rocac hutu hutg which are involved in pathways that feed tca cycle were all down-regulated the acetoin-formation carbon overflow pathway which was activated by glucose was enhanced under low oxygen supply as alssd were induced induction of carbon overflow pathway might refer to the reduced state of the bacteria grown under low oxygen supply if the acetoin-formation overflow pathway was enhanced carbon flow to tca cycle might be reduced and additional nadh generation in the tca cycle will be prevented in this study bacillus subtilis atcc 21616 xanthine
