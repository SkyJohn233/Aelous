Sister Wants To Have Wedding On My Birthday Weekend | Weddings, Planning | Wedding Forums | WeddingWire Planning Do I have the right to be upset if my little sister wants to have her wedding on the weekend of my 35th birthday?  My birthday would be on the day of her rehearsal and I'm feeling frustrated that I would be required to cater to her on my birthday and hang out with her friends, etc.  It's also the first time my birthday falls on a weekend in 5 years.  She is getting married at her fiance's family ranch and could have chosen ANY weekend in the summer, but instead, she chose my birthday weekend.  It's a catch 22, because if I try to celebrate my birthday in any way, people will get upset at me for "taking away from the bride."  I'm single, it's my 5-years younger sister getting married, and I am not allowed to bring a date.  Thoughts? Replies Ummm IMO you get tons of b-days and only 1 wedding. I seriously don't think it's that big of a deal. Especially if you don't already have plans.  Flag Not going to lie, I'd be a little irritated. However, ask her WHY she chose that weekend.  Sure, maybe the ranch was available, but maybe other people weren't - like his family being out of town or such on other weekends nearby. If that indeed is the ONLY weekend they can do it, then I'd just suck it up.  Your birthday the following year might be on a Saturday.   Flag Being the first to comment I don't want to come across rude but... No, you don't have a right. Can you be bothered? Yes, absolutely and I can see why it sucks for you. However, I'm sure there were a lot of considerations in picking a date that maybe you're unaware of. IMO you should voice to her that it kind of sucks to miss your birthday and you're disappointed  but you should support her know this monumental day and suck it up. Guessing her wedding is a Saturday, which means your birthday is a Friday... Next year your birthday will be on a weekend again! Yay! Celebrate your birthday they weekend before, or the weekend after, not really a big deal.  Flag You're being selfish and jealous. You're sister is getting married and you should be happy for her. A birthday is just a birthday. You've had 34 of them and hopefully many more.  Flag You not being allowed to bring a date is the only thing I see wrong here.  Flag If you're single, why are you on a wedding planning forum? Yes, its selfish.  Flag Since she could have her wedding on any weekend, I would NICELY ask her why she chose your bday weekend. I would be a little upset too. Maybe she has a good reason tho. Also, you not able to bring a date just seems not very nice, unless she is going by the "only if you're in a long term relationship" type rule.  Flag You get a birthDAY, not a weekend. You sound extremely childish and selfish. ETA: if your not paying for the wedding, you have no right to say if you get to bring a date or not. Plus you're single, perhaps your sister doesn't want to celebrate one of the most exciting times in her life with someone she may not know or care for based on who you would choose to bring. I'm taking it that you will know a decent portion of the guests there, you don't need a date. Flag That BITCH!!! How dare she get married on your birthday weekend??? Flag Ummm really? You're going to have plenty more birthdays. Let your sister enjoy her day and celebrate a different day.  Flag What? lol Wedding is once in a lifetime...birthday is once a year. Get over it. Who even celebrates birthdays after 21? Flag Wow. Your birthday is exactly that it's a DAY. I seriously dislike people who turn their birthday into a week long extravaganza and expect everyone to kiss their ass. She's getting married the day after your birthday for God's sake quit whining about it and acting like a spoiled brat act like the 35 year old you are.  Flag You are being very selfish. You can celebrate your birthday the weekend before or after. She has one special day.  Flag @Mrs. A  &  J good point! If your are single, why do you have a wedding date of today  &  are on a wedding forum? Flag I agree with Rachel, Your not being allowed to bring a date is the only thing I see wrong as well.  If you were close to and very happy for your sister I doubt this would be an issue.  I know it wouldn't be for me If my sister picked my b-day weekend.   So unless there is some really strong sister rivalry and she chose your B-day weekend knowing it would piss you off or your envious of her getting married?? Flag Calm down. It's one birthday and her wedding. You sound like a jealous older sister. Celebrate your birthday the week before or after. What are you doing on WW if you're single?  Flag Is the real issue the birthday "weekend" (?) or that she didn't give you a plus one to bring a guest? I'd also feel weird if my sibling didn't give me one.  The birthday part does seem a bit selfish. If this year you move them to the weekend prior or after the wedding, I'm sure your friends would totally understand you had to do it because of your sister's wedding and would be happy to party on a different weekend.  Flag No. You don't have the right to be upset.  You have (arguably) the courtesy of having a date for the night, keeping your trap shut after your actual birthday and acting like a gracious and loving sister.  Even if you aren't.  And if you're on here, not getting married or married and looking for support, you're a troll. Flag She had a wedding question, so I can see why she might ask here. We have a bunch of maid of honors and even some mother of the brides so I don't think it's too far of a stretch. I do agree with previous posters. The wedding weekend being the same as your birthday isn't that big of a deal. Let it go. I would think as sister of the bride you are entitled to a plus one. If you have a good relationship with your sister talk to her about that. Try to enjoy it. It's a cuple of days of parties that if your sister is hosting correctly should be free for you! Flag Its one of the most important days of her life and she's your sister... Get over it you'll have more birthdays.
