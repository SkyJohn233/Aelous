The dolls' house is coming to life in the new exhibition 'Small Stories' By  CW Contributor  on 26/8/2014  These little dwellings have so many  stories  to tell – not just about toys and childhood, but architecture, family structures, domestic life and how people have lived throughout the ages.  There is also an incredible variety from  country mansions ,  Georgian town houses  and  high-rise flats  to a  multi-coloured kaleidoscope house  filled with designer furniture and artwork. One suburban council house shows a family with  tiny gas masks  poised for an air-raid in the thick of World War Two, while beside an adjacent modern country house, an  outdoor swimming pool  would be enticing if only it weren't so small.  Inhabitants, lodgers, servants and guests have been brought to life through  recordings . As you explore the dolls’ houses, they talk you through the challenges of rationing, the rising status of women through the Georgian era, the challenges of living in an industrial city and the introduction of electric lamps in London.  Their stories are playful and fascinating, imaginative and perfectly in keeping with the role of the doll’s house as a  domestic teaching aid , a place for play and escape, and a record of lifestyles. The stories of those who owned the houses are just as colourful too.  There’s something a little bit  unnerving  about the  obsessive detail  that goes into the creation of each doll's house, which in this case only adds to their gravitational pull.  Small Stories  has lovingly restored these details, giving us more to see than you might think. Royal Institution talks 2019 click for more visual arts   recommendations The V & A's lesser known Museum of Childhood in Bethnal Green houses an amazing collection of childhood-related objects and artefacts which range from the 1600s to the present day. Look out for the huge assortment of family fun activities and why not hire a private space for your next  children's birthday party ? Hackney City Farm  . this secluded little enclave is a perfect stop for all the family. Small and endlessly charming, it is full of animals from ducks to donkeys –the kids will love it. The attached Frizzzante Restaurant has great family atmosphere with organic, seasonal food. We loved the (unseasonal) boozy baked banana dessert- not for the kids.
