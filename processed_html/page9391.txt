First of all your camp sights are private , unlike alot of Maniroba camp grounds that I have been to over the years. I found the camp ground to be very friendly and kind aswell as the people that go there for the day from the near by IR. It is a bit of a ride to the nearest town so come ready. Keep in mind you are camping , and dont let the snakes scare you as they are more afraid of you. We singed up for a seasonal sight after our first visit there. We do not have a RV but maybe one day . As there should be there are rules and as I have seen they were enforced. The beach is small and the water is shalow so you do have to walk out quite aways. Water shoes are a must as it is very rocky for a bit, you do get to soft sand the further you go. The cliffs are amazing and a must see for all who go . From the water or from the hiking trail it is an amazing sight to see. And for the fisherman/woman the fishing is great. Shore fishing will get you lots if Jack , but out on the lake there is white fish, perch, walleye.... to be found as well as other fish that I just can not think of at this time. The wash rooms and laundry facilities are in good condition. And are cleaned every morn. This will be our first full summer at Steep Rock as seasonal campers. Our first visit to this amazing place was just last year and we were drawn back a few more times before the end if season, that to me was to soon. My family and I are very excited to be going for the summer the count down for us has now begun. This place is run by a non-profit group.  The rates for camping are pretty cheap and the facilities are in working order.  It ' s not always pretty, but it works.First, the nearest gas station is 20 minutes away so make sure you fill up before coming here.  Buy your supplies in Winnipeg.  There is a co-op (20 minutes away), but their selection is pretty limited.When you check in, the park office will give you a huge list of rules.  Seriously, it ' s 2 pages long.  It ' s meant to keep the place peaceful and clean.  Unfortunately, the rules aren ' t enforced.  For example, one of the rules is that dogs aren ' t allowed on the beach.  When we went, we saw one group of campers with five dogs on the beach.  Not only that, none of those dogs were on a leash (another of the park rules).  Yet another example is that 11 p.m. - 9 a.m. is  " quiet time "  so you can ' t be excessively loud and the use of motor vehicles are prohibited.  We were awoken by people on ATVs at 3 a.m.Most of the campers here have RVs.  I think we were the only ones who pitched a tent.  They even have satellite hookups available for RVs.  On the weekend, it gets busy with Winnipegers coming up for the weekend.  Many of them bring ATVs and ride around the campsite in the ATVs.  The roads by the camp are dirt roads, but the area around the campsites really isn ' t that large so unless you like motorized toys, there was no need for an ATV.  The website says that the park covers over 160 acres, but much of that must be rented out seasonally because the part that we had access to wasn ' t all that big.  The beach, like much of Steep Rock, is mostly covered in limestone.  There is a small patch of sandy beach near the campgrounds, which was nice.  The lake is very shallow at the beach so you could go out about 50 feet and the water is only about 5 feet deep.There are heated showers, washrooms, flushing toilets, even a cafe on the campgrounds.  The campsites themselves could have used some work.  They weren ' t cleaned up very well - tons of  cigarette butts, old beer cans, etc.  Each campsite had a little fire pit with a metal ring around it.  No grate.  You can ' t use any of the wood around the campgrounds - you can buy firewood at the co-op or in the park office.If you HAVE to go to the cafe, I would recommend sticking to pizza.  I ordered fish  &  chips and got something that looked like deep fried Gorton ' s fish portions.  Did I mention that the fish portions were raw?  Yep.  I sent them back and when they brought out some new ones, those, too, were raw.  The chips were mostly soggy, but at least the potatoes were cooked.I would probably only have given this place 2 stars, but I didn ' t have the heart to do it.  The people were so kind.If you come here, make sure you keep going about 4 km north to visit the guy with the ice cream shop right by the lake.  He was great.  Don ' t forget to sign his shelf.

It looks like we don't have a specific address for Steep Rock Beach Park, which makes giving directions tricky. This business might not have an official storefront, or it might move to multiple locations throughout the day. Give me directions anyway...
