The Arabia has long been considered the premiere wreck todive in the Fathom Five National Marine Park. A 3 masted Barque, it wasoriginally built in Kingston, Ontario and launched 1853. It fell victim to theunpredictable October weather in 1884 while enroute to Midland, Ontario,originating from Chicago, Illinois. The wreck is perhaps one of the most intact in the area. One of the mostimpressive features of the wreck is it's bow with a prominent bowsprit. Otherfeatures of interest include it's three masts which lie by the side of the hullof the ship, the ship's wheel which lies near the stern of the ship (with aplaque adjacent to the wheel), anchors, deadeyes on the railing. The conditions at the wreck can at times be challenging, often with lowvisibility, cold temperatures, and currents. Since the wreck's discovery in1970, there have been a number of divers who have perished on the wreck, givingthe wreck a reputation for being a dive only for experienced divers.
