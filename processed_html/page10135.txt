Queen Majesty: The Anthology - The Techniques | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusic Add to Custom List Add to My Collection         Share on                         One of Jamaica's most influential vocal groups,  the Techniques ' history was particularly convoluted. Formed in late 1964, the original group comprised lead singer  Slim Smith ,  Winston Riley ,  Frederick Waite , and  Franklyn White . Their recording debut, "No One," was overseen by  Edward Seaga , but it was their subsequent singles for  Duke Reid  that took the island by storm, with 1965's "Little Did You Know" the first of many to top the Jamaican chart.                                     With  Smith 's emotive vocals to the fore,  the Techniques  skanked their imprimatur across the ska age. But just as rocksteady began to take hold,  Smith  decamped for a solo career at Studio One, which continued even after he formed  the Uniques  in 1968. From this point out,  the Techniques  were a highly unstable unit, who against all odds continued recording incredibly sublime music. The remaining trio eventually crumbled, but a new one featuring  Riley ,  Junior Menz , and  Pat Kelly  rose phoenix-like in its place, sailing to number one with "You Don't Care for Me at All."  Kelly  departed for school in the States, with  Menz  taking over the lead, and  Bruce Ruffin  enlisted; it was this lineup that recorded the band's enduring classic "Queen Majesty."  Kelly  then returned,  Menz  left, and the rejigged trio continued cutting hits such as the festive "Run Come Celebrate." Over the next few years, more singers came and went,  Dave Barker  and ex- Termite Lloyd Parks  came;  Riley  himself left for a career in production. To further muddy the waters for later fans,  Smith  set about covering a number of his former band's old hits. Regardless of these upheavals,  the Techniques / standards never slipped, as this sensational compilation illustrates. As typical with Trojan compilations, the sequencing follows its own inexplicable logic, only vaguely chronological. Which makes identification of the different lineups difficult, although the credits sometimes help identify the lead singer. Even packed with tracks, amazingly quite a number of songs escaped the compiler of  Queen Majesty , but you'd need a box set for them all. Still, the group's myriad hits are virtually all present and accounted for, taking listeners from their early ska heights into their rocksteady reign and on through their reggae prime. An absolute must-have for every fan of Jamaican vocal groups.                  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.
