cricket now we re playing first-class cricket it was our dream to play test cricket it was just our second test and we won the game i ll give a lot of credit to our bowlers especially rashid khan waqar salamkheil yamin ahmadzai and mohammad nabi they bowled very well on a wicket that was good for batting. apart from the bowling quartet one of afghanistan s stars was rahmat shah he put behind poor form in the odis ‚Äì he scored just one half-century in five outings ‚Äì to score two in as many innings in test whites number of matches to first test win 1 australia 2 england 2 pakistan 2 afghanistan 6 west indies 11 zimbabwe 12 south africa 14 sri lanka 25 india 35 bangladesh 45 new zealand howzstat afgvire pic.twitter.com/reiatttrd2 he was unfortunate to miss out on a century by two runs in the first innings and having done the hard work in the second scoring a 122-ball 76 he was dismissed with just three runs required to seal victory however during the course of his knock he displayed good temperament for tests and that is something that bodes well for afghanistan i 'd like to congratulate the country for this win he said after winning the player of the match award there was a difference in the pitches ‚Äì the odi wickets were suitable for spin this was better for batting i stayed at the wicket that was important we played session by session and tried to win the match but i d like to give credit to the bowlers they bowled really well. history afghanistan beat irelandcricket by 7 wickets in the one-off islamic bank of afghanistan test in dehradun for the team 's maiden win in the longest format of the game afgvire pic.twitter.com/k6elfcwg9n as for ireland there were some smiles despite being beaten within four days in their second ever test their captain william porterfield reminded everyone that quite a few of their players were playing only their second test ever while the rest of the team ‚Äì five players to be precise ‚Äì were making their debuts despite that they troubled afghanistan considerably and had they been able to do better with the bat in the first innings they might yet have been able to change the eventual result it s obviously the first innings that went wrong for us he said at the post-match presentation it was big toss to win any multi-day game the first innings you got to capitalise on he said üèÜ no.‚òùÔ∏è afgvire pic.twitter.com/n2j8neop8r if you had done that batted remotely like we batted in the second innings it could have been a completely different game then you re talking about potentially chasing upwards of 280 to 300 which could have been a completely different story. but that being said porterfield wasn t making excuses afghanistan bossed them with both bat and ball in the crucial stages of the match and he gave credit where it was due take nothing away from afghanistan he said they played very well throughout the whole game and came out deserved winners you want the lads to kick on and make big contributions we didn t do that in the first innings we re obviously looking to come back into the game from that once afghanistan got past us they never really let us back news fixtures and updates tailored to your favourite team never miss a moment marnus labuschagne 's red-hot test form has earned him a maiden one-day international call-up as he was named in australia 's 14-man squad
