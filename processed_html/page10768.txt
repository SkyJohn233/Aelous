MALHADO ISLAND . Isla de Malhado ("Isle of Misfortune") was the name applied by  Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca  to an island off the Texas coast where and he and approximately eighty Spaniards and an African were shipwrecked in November 1528. The location of this landform has often been the subject of heated debate since the 1920s. For example, plaintiffs in Civil Action No. G-78-188 (1990), heard by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Galveston Division, contended that "Malhado is Galveston Island." The court found those arguments unconvincing, as do many historians. There are compelling arguments that the initial landfall was slightly to the west of Galveston Island, and that Cabeza de Vaca's Malhado was a combination of San Luis Island and Oyster Bay peninsula in the Brazosport area. This revisionist conjecture was first advanced in 1918 by  Harbert Davenport  and Joseph X. Wells. Central to the Davenport and Wells thesis is their contention that silting from the discharge of rivers and the impact of  hurricanes  turned what had been an elongated island in Cabeza de Vaca's time into a peninsula. Furthermore, the dimensions of Malhado, given by Cabeza de Vaca as about one-half league by five leagues (1.3 by 13 miles), are too small for Galveston Island but approximate those of San Luis Island. Spaniards, as modern-day measurements have confirmed, have been amazingly accurate in estimating their travel in leagues. If San Luis Island is accepted as Malhado, then the distances between it and four successive waterways (Oyster Creek, the Brazos River, the San Bernardo River, and Caney Creek), which were crossed by Cabeza de Vaca's men as he made his way down the coast, are consistent with his account and topography. The large island described by Cabeza de Vaca as lying behind Malhado (toward Florida) logically becomes Galveston Island. No one can determine with absolute certainty any portion of Cabeza de Vaca's journey across Texas and large portions of Mexico during the years 1528 to 1536. With his own  Relación  and a  Joint Report  written by Cabeza de Vaca, Andrés Dorantes de Carranza, and Alonso Castillo Maldonado qqv  as the sole eyewitness accounts of that odyssey, route interpreters must rely on logic, distances traveled, gross landscape features as described in the narratives, flora, fauna, and ethnographic evidence. These considerations suggest that Isla de Malhado was San Luis Island rather than Galveston Island.
