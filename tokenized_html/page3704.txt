block and graft copolymers and nanogel™ copolymer networks for dna delivery into cell journal of drug targeting vol 8 no 2 self-assembling complexes from nucleic acids and synthetic polymers are evaluated for plasmid and oligonucleotide oligo delivery polycations having linear branched dendritic block- or graft copolymer architectures are used in these studies all these molecules bind to nucleic acids due to formation of cooperative systems of salt bonds between the cationic groups of the polycation and phosphate groups of the dna to improve solubility of the dna/polycation complexes cationic block and graft copolymers containing segments from polycations and non-ionic soluble polymers for example poly ethylene oxide peo were developed binding of these copolymers with short dna chains such as oligos results in formation of species containing hydrophobic sites from neutralized dna-polycation complex and hydrophilic sites from peo these species spontaneously associate into polyion complex micelles with a hydrophobic core from neutralized polyions and a hydrophilic shell from peo such complexes are very small 10-40 nm and stable in solution despite complete neutralization of charge they reveal significant activity with oligos in vitro and in vivo binding of cationic copolymers to plasmid dna forms larger 70-200 nm complexes which are practically inactive in cell transfection studies it is likely that peo prevents binding of these complexes with the cell membranes stealth effect however attaching specific ligands to the peo-corona can produce complexes which are both stable in solution and bind to target cells the most efficient complexes were obtained when peo in the cationic copolymer was replaced with membrane-active peo- b -poly propylene oxide b -peo molecules pluronic 123 such complexes exhibited elevated levels of transgene expression in liver following systemic administration in mice to increase stability of the complexes nanogel™ carriers were developed that represent small hydrogel particles synthesized by cross-linking of pei with double end activated peo using an emulsification/solvent evaporation technique oligos are immobilized by mixing with nanogel™ suspension which results in the formation of small particles 80 nm oligos incorporated in nanogel are able to reach targets within the cell and suppress gene expression in a sequence-specific fashion further loaded nanogel particles cross-polarized monolayers of intestinal cells caco-2 suggesting potential usefulness of these systems for oral administration of oligos in conclusion the approaches using polycations for gene delivery for the design of gene transfer complexes that exhibit a very broad range of physicochemical and biological properties which is essential for design of a new generation of more effective non-viral gene delivery systems registered in england wales no 3099067 5 howick place london sw1p 1wg p accept we use cookies to improve your website experience to learn about our use of cookies and how you can manage your cookie settings please see our cookie policy by closing this message you are consenting to our use of cookies
