FREE WIFI AND FREE PARKING FOR HOTEL GUESTS - Review of M Hotel Singapore, Singapore - TripAdvisor This hotel is situated right in the CBD area. We chose this hotel because of its price value on our chosen dates. If you are driving, it has complimentary parking for hotel guests and free wifi in the room. But surprisingly, when I was outside the hotel premises, I could still receive the wifi signal till I was a little further away. The only thing I had to complain about this hotel is, that the bath area is too small an area to shower and the glass door keep opening and water is splattered all over the floor. Other than that, everything is in perfect order.

Extremly well located, and very confortable for its type of hotel. The great thing is that it has a bus stop and a taxi stop pretty much in front of the hotel, so you can go anywhere in Singapore very fast. The part I did not like so much was the food, it was quite standard if you compare it to the avg.

Stayed for business trip, the hotel location is ideal for business traveller. ><br >Unfortunately the staff needs more training for hospitality. Did my check in and was treated with a sour face by the front desk officer. ><br >During lunch time in their restaurant the waiter was  " too responsive "  clean up my plate even before I finish everything and even after I told him I was still eating. But he did not hear what I was saying. ><br >Not recommending to stay here again.

I really enjoyed my stay,the staff were very friendly,the location is perfect,close to chinatown and at the same time close to the Marina.Breakfast is ordered separately but very well priced.The pool is small but at the same time small and not crowded,I would def go back and stay there as the rooms are spacious and beds are very comfortable. Dear sherine462, > <br >It is with great pleasure knowing that you are full of praises for the M Hotel Singapore, in particular with the good service standard. We are humbled by your good feedback and will continually endeavour for higher hospitality standards. ><br >We hope to be your preferred hotel and look forward to having you back for another enjoyable stay. I liked the spacious room with convenient big desk. Not sure why the shower cubicle had to be so cramped when there is so much space in the room, but there is no reasoning with some architects. The front desk and convierge staff were helpful and efficient, the housekeeping is good and rooms are clean, and I found the location convenient for meeting people downtown. Taxi drivers also seem to know it. Good WiFi. Room price was in line with quality.
