The staff are truly kind, down to earth, and eager to help! They found my partner ' s wallet in the robe after we had checked out and were wonderful in getting it back to us! They also were gracious enough to hold onto our luggage on our last day while we went shopping around town! The spa can be privately reserved for 1 hour increments which made the experience intimate and sweet. I purchased an additional massage from a fabulously talented masseuse, and would highly recommend her services! Stayed in July 2019 Reviewed: 7 July 2019 Paul Views were spectacular!
