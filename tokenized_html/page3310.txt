i love this 50s housewife-themed bridal shower offbeat bride our new publication arielist susan of susan sabo photography explained my daughter s friend had the most awesome bridal shower last week it was 50s housewife-themed decorated to the nines by her friends. the moment her daughter told her about it she volunteered to shoot it and thank gawd she did because it looked amazing the centerpieces kill me simple flowers next to a framed pinup photo really set up the whole sexy girly good-times mood it looks like they asked everyone to bring a recipe to share with the bride which is a perfect idea for this shower theme the favors were wooden mixing spoons i wouldn t mind pretending i d know what to do with that spoon if it got me one of those yummy cupcakes speaking of food i love how they broke out all their mid-century-style home goods like those old coco cola cups the tiered serving tray and the vintage baking soda boxes also you got ta serve deviled eggs and make sure to have toothpicks in all your appetizers but we all know you re gon na throw this shower for the fashion look at all those amazing colors and styles with the combination of 50s housewife dresses and adorable aprons tribesmaid writeroffiction and her groom had a killer coed wedding shower with trivia games instead of traditional shower games a blind beer-tasting competition and they read more and awesome
