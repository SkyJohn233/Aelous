What is the volume, in mL, of 0.860 lbs of alcohol? | Yahoo Answers Please advise how to calculate these 2 problems: 1. What is the volume, in mL, of 0.860 lbs of alcohol, given that the density of alcohol is 0.780 g/mL? 2. How many pounds of mercury are in 500. mL of mercury, given that the density of mercury is 13.69 g/mL? THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 453.592 grams is equivalent to a pound. 0.860 x (453.592g/1lb) x (1ml/0.780g)  Just plug it in to your calc. 500. mL mercury x (13.69g/1mL) x (1lb/453.592g)  Plug and chug. BTW, both answers have three significant figures. Isn &# x27;t this website wonderful? 1. Density = mass over volume. Rearranged, V = m/D V = (0.860lbs)(1g/0.002205lb) / (0.780g/mL) Be sure to include that conversion factor, so that the weight and density are compatible. 2. Density = mass over volume. Rearranged, m = DV m = (13.69g/mL)(0.002205lb/1g)(500.mL) Again, be sure to include the conversion factor.
