A preview of what LinkedIn members have to say about Cheryl: There are people who are enjoyable to work with because of their personality. And there are people who are very good at what they do. Cheryl has the rare combination. I had the privilege of working with Cheryl on projects from 2013-14 while we were both with eBay. Cheryl is always organized and prepared, yet agile and ready to pivot when the right opportunity arises. But my biggest grins came with watching Cheryl engage with people. One day I hope to have her passion for people, as she is graceful and effective working with everyone she meets. No matter what team or project you are working on- it is better to have Cheryl working on it at your side. There are people who are enjoyable to work with because of their personality.
