Ambassadors for the This Girl Can Suffolk campaign took over the operational roles of the regular 5km event in Christchurch Park on Saturday. Participants were asked to dress in pink in support of charity Beat, which acts as a champion for people affected by an eating disorder. Ipswich mayor Sarah Barber is an ambassador and she welcomed runners across the finish line. Adele Chaplin, who led the project, he said: “It was all well received and we had a good day.” She added the event attracted some new joggers to the parkrun. The initial plan was to collect donations for Beat during the race, but this is against parkrun policy.  The ambassadors have therefore launched a  Just Giving page  for supporters to make a pledge.
