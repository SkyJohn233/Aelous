The World ' s most recently posted photos of firefighting and rosenbauer - Flickr Hive Mind  We use cookies!  Our  Privacy Policy  has been updated. Welcome  to Flickr Hive Mind. If you   log into Flickr   you will see your private photos and larger thumbnails. Flickr Hive Mind  is a data mining tool for the  Flickr  database of photography.    Flickr Hive Mind  is a search engine as well as an experiment in the power of  Folksonomies . All thumbnail images come directly from  Flickr , none are stored on  Flickr Hive Mind . These photos are bound by the copyright and license of their owners, the thumbnail links take to you to the photos (as well as their copyright and license details) within  Flickr . Because some other search engines (Google, etc.) index parts of      Flickr Hive Mind , you may have been led here from one of them.  Welcome to Flickr Hive Mind, almost certainly the best search engine for photography on the web.  If you are a  Flickr      user and use  Flickr  Stats you     may have seen people being led to your photos via  Flickr Hive Mind  (as a Referrer).    Flickr requires that I inform you that Flickr Hive Mind uses the Flickr API, but is neither endorsed nor certified by them.    There are literally hundreds of other web tools built around the Flickr API, see      Flickr Bits  for a bunch of examples.    If you are unhappy with your photos' presence on this site, you can  (a)      make your photos private for yourself, friends, and family.  These settings will be instantly honored by     Flickr Hive Mind and all other API-driven applications.   (b)  Hide your photos globally from text and tag searches on 3rd party sites that use the Flickr API, via your preference settings on Flickr. See the privacy tab at:      https://flickr.com/account/ . To also remove yourself from searches for specific user names, you will need to set your  Flickr profile  to be hidden from searches.    Flickr has finally   created a single page with all these settings , this is much easier to do now and is the preferred method - it will shut down all API driven sites.     Google has a bad habit of keeping out-of-date links and thumbnails in their search results, I can try to help you remove them.     (c)  Finally, you can     Banish Yourself     From Flickr Hive Mind .  To banish yourself from Flickr Hive Mind, you must first  authenticate to Flickr , which lets Flickr Hive Mind identify who you are.  This is necessary to make sure you are the user in question, and also because people use such crazy characters in their Flickr user names. You can revoke access when finished. Once logged in, come back to this area                               and there will be a link to banish you. If there are any problems email me at nosflickrhivemind ... at ...  fiveprime ... dot ...  org.

Flickr Hive Mind  can also be an effective tool to identify photography with licenses that allow non-commercial (and sometimes) commercial use.       Inspired by (and thanks to)  Flickr Leech .
