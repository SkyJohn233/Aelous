japanese personality character explained japan explained fasaq if japanese people are supposed to be shy how come they practice their golf swings and ballroom dancing moves on the station platform most japanese people seeing this might also think it is crazy but for the minority of japanese who go through life completely unaware of the subtle way in which people express their disapproval the same systems that keep everyone else in line leave them to be as eccentric as they like a general acceptance of people taking their hobbies very seriously might also be a factor your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name email website notify me of new comments via email notify me of new posts via email this site uses akismet to reduce spam learn how your comment data is processed people at work say i m unsociable i am not unfriendly and i certainly am not a snob i just tell them i am japanese thinking that would mean something to someone but in this white world it means nothing to no one no one understands my nature is japanese i m just a shy and timid person they don t understand and i am labeled unsociable mostly because when a group of socialize people see someone such as a classmate co-worker or a possible person that they think is cool sitting by themselves rather than talking to people they assume that they are anti-social and for the most part it can be somewhat considered anti-social it just isn t by choice unlike maybe a grumpy and/or older person personally speaking i ve been there before too i went through elementary middle and early high school being the quiet and anti-social kid and i m american it s hard sometimes over coming your shy and timid side and perhaps it is something like social anxiety something you can t control however don t let that or the fact that you are japanese stop you from being social guys like brave girls my nationality says i am japanese i got a japanese passport that says i am japanese but what exactly is to be japanese my father who is also japanese says japanese people are diligent organized punctual and workaholic i think i am more of anti-social person rather than shy so am i still japanese is it because i grew up outside of japan that i am no longer japanese i don t think japanese people who do eccentric things have to be unaware of other people s approval you can be aware of someone else s subtle disapproval and just not care because it s so subtly expressed in europe or america disapproval is more likely to be expressed aggressively not all the time of course or even as commonly as it might sometimes seem but enough to put off more introverted people from expressing their eccentric tendencies i just tell them i am japanese thinking that would mean something to someone why would that mean anything to anyone who is not japanese it wouldn t and thinking that it would translates as an i m special complex to avoid adapting to a group to which one belongs is very isolationist and is the characteristic of a person who is a snob either way it is indeed anti-social if you want to be able to communicate effectively-maybe teach a person something maybe learn something-then you must leave homogeneous hangups where you found them the world is too full of good to be found in relationships with other people to allow being japanese to stagnate your world views and personal growth get over yourself please for the sake of your coworkers who undoubtedly are made to feel very uncomfortable because of either your inability or lack of desire to assimilate into your workplace culture and mostly for your own sanity it must be very difficult to keep working every day with people who you do not trust i m american and work with a group of people who are all-each and every one except me-japanese one or two of them are anti-social with me but the other 15 or so are very social and fun to work with get a second opinion from someone because you probably are simply anti-social if everyone has labeled you that way look at your situation through the eyes of others if you want to be true to yourself as it relates to intercultural relationships i m partly japanese but i have japanese personality the most sometimes my friends who are not japanese asks me to hang out with them but i just don t feel comfortable joining groups i d feel better with a single friend or double i avoid being exposed to big groups i feel a bit different maybe because they are not japanese and few of my japanese friends are not so much like me all japanese have their natural personalities maybe some of them just have different characteristics i feel the exact same way and i was born and raised in canada by a polish mother i hate doing anything in groups and would much prefer to concentrate on one friend at a time many people don t seem to feel the same way so i avoid most large social gatherings view full site blog at wordpress.com
