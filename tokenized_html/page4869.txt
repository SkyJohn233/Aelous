after andromeda a harry potter fanfic fanfiction disclaimer i do not own harry potter after andromeda by silver sailor ganymede normally narcissa would have been livid that the snow was soaking her second-favourite pair of shoes but frankly she had far more disturbing things on her mind right now if rumour was correct and she as a slytherin knew that it usually was then her beloved sister andromeda had just eloped with a mudblood if an even worse rumour was true then her sister was already pregnant with that mudblood 's child but narcissa hoped with all her heart that this was n't true a mudblood child would be a stain on the purest most ancient and most noble house of black and such a thing just would n't do mudbloods were freaks horrific abominations that went against everything the wizarding world had so long stood for but now people were saying that the perfect slytherin andromeda druella black had run off with mudblood ted tonks and was carrying his child before they even married bellatrix had made narcissa cry enough in the past for her to know what tears felt like – but andromeda had never been the cause of those tears before never bellatrix had hurt her and made her cry yes but not like this the pains bellatrix inflicted were never too long-lasting but narcissa was already worried that the wounds andromeda had made would never heal for all her madness bellatrix had never betrayed her family she understood the importance of keeping one 's blood pure of not betraying one 's family andromeda however had neglected to learn that lesson and now she was only a charred blank on the family tree a traitor who had married a mudblood – so why did narcissa feel like her heart was breaking now that her sister was gone she collapsed by the edge of the great lake not caring now that the snow was soaking her robes as well as her shoes she wanted to be on her own she wanted to be far far away from the jibes and sneers and taunts of her fellows this was ridiculous it was absolutely ridiculous she had to endure their scorn yet she had done nothing wrong nothing cissy are you ok narcissa looked up ready to insult whomever had been stupid enough to call her by that most hated of childhood nicknames but then she saw that sirius of all people was standing next to her a look of concern on his face well this was interesting sirius had n't deigned to speak to any of them much since he had shamed the family by being sorted into gryffindor so why was he talking to her now cissy he said again are you alright i 'm fine she snarled back but evidently her younger cousin was in no way prepared to accept that answer of course you 're ok he said sitting himself down next to her i mean everyone knows that narcissa black is prone to crying fits and does n't mind of her shoes and robes get soaked through by snow the sarcasm in his voice was thick enough to cut through with a severing charm and narcissa could n't help but glare at him with even more venom come off it cissy i know you 're not okay so why why do you think she said endeavouring to make her voice even colder than the snow that surrounded them andromeda sirius asked and narcissa found herself involuntarily flinching at the mention of her sister 's name why else i ca n't see why you 're not just happy for her sirius replied that gryffindor-temper of his already making itself known i mean so what if she did n't marry a pureblood she loves him and he loves her what else really ought to matter i mean it 's not like she 's killed anyone yes she has narcissa found herself almost shrieking at him by running off with that mudblood she 's ruined my chances of ever securing a decent marriage she may have made her own life better by she 's destroyed my chances of ever having a life in the process oh come off it cissy sirius said that 's totally melodramatic he looked as though he were about to laugh but narcissa 's venomous expression stopped him you 're a boy sirius narcissa spat you 'll never have to worry about this leastways not so much as we do all i had to look forward to in life was to be married off to a much older wizard and bear him numerous heirs – and now that she 's gone and done this i do n't even have that in my future what 's going to happen to me now no one 's going to want to marry the younger sister of a bloodtraitor she could see that sirius was disgusted by her use of such language but for once in his life he was more tactful than to say anything about it instead he looked at her and grinned slightly though what he had to be grinning about narcissa had no idea if by 'much older you mean a year and if by 'no one you mean lucius malfoy sirius said and narcissa started confused what are you talking about i heard our mothers talking about it over christmas sirius replied and narcissa for once felt oh-so-glad for her cousin 's reckless gryffindorish penchant for eavesdropping apparently lucius has already asked uncle cygnus if he can begin courting you this summer and it seems like its been approved and this was all after dromeda had disappeared so i do n't think the malfoys will be too put off dromeda 's been disowned now after all so no one 's going to call you the 'sister of a bloodtraitor if that 's what you 're worried about he spat out the last words as though they had left a disgusting taste in his mouth so even though dromeda 's been disowned and she 's not technically even your sister anymore try to by happy for her ok i do n't think it 'd be easy running away from your entire family like that with that sirius got up and began to walk away into the snow narcissa sat there for a few moments trying to fully process the fact that she had just confided in sirius of all people and then realised that she had much more pressing matters on her mind than what andromeda was doing with her life the snow was slowing ruining her second-best pair of shoes
