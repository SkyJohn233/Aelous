UserBenchmark: AMD Ryzen 5 1400 vs Intel Core2 Quad Q9650 4 Cores,  @3 GHz, Yorkfield. Release date ≤ Q4 2013. 4 Cores, 8 Threads @3.2GHz, Zen. Release date: Q2 2017. The Ryzen 5 1400 is the entry-level chip from AMD's latest Ryzen 5 series which is aimed at the mainstream market. The 1400 is a budget quad core, 8 threaded CPU with base/boost clocks of 3.2/3.4 GHz. Like most the other non-X Ryzen CPUs the 1400 comes with a decent cooler included in the box (Wraith Stealth in this case). Modestly priced at $169 the 1400 is in direct competition with Intel's recent Kaby Lake dual core, four threaded  i3-7350k  which runs at a base clock of 4.2GHz. The 1400's 8 threads allow a near 40% lead in  multi-core  processing, but for  single-core  tasks the 7350K is 45% faster. The  Ryzen 5 1500X  commands a $20 premium and offers a 25% increase in effective speed over the 1400. Although the 1400 only has a base clock of 3.2 GHz it should more or less match the 1500X when overclocked. Provided it is  overclocked , the 1400 joins the other non-X Ryzen models in offering the best bang for your buck. Users not keen on overclocking would probably do better to consider the 1500X at this price point.  [ Apr '17   CPUPro ] We calculate  effective speed  which measures real world performance for typical gamers and desktop users.
