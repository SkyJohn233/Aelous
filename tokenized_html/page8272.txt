how to call an external gradle script once with all tasks to run from original script help/discuss gradle forums i have two build scripts script a a multi-project build with 6 sub projects script b a multi-project build with 20+ sub projects the b script drives a third party compilation tool that makes assumptions about being in the root of the overall build the result is that a b can not be included in a single unified multi-project build i ve been asked to tie the scripts together so that a developer can execute the gradle once in the root directory and have everything build i figured out one way to do this at a task level however with this structure the execution takes significantly more time than running the two scripts separately i figure this is due to the overhead of spinning up a separate external build for each task from the a script i am looking for a way to call the b script just once passing all of the command line arguments ideally this would mean just one b-script execution i am sure this can be done i m just not sure how if i am understanding you correctly you could call the b project with the same task arguments used to run a powered by discourse best viewed with javascript enabled
