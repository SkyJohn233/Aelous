coming back in the house with sand-ridden butts as well as a cover which can be tied into small holes in the wooden walls so it doesn t blow away when the wind picks up it s also worth keeping in mind

one of the best kid s sandboxes we ll let you decide recommended ages not stated not all sandboxes need to follow the same design the badger basket bamboo beach sandbox is something that s strikingly noticeable and the risky design pays off for those looking for something a little different while a sandbox built from bamboo isn t going to be as durable as something built from cedar wood it still holds around 800 pounds of sand and those corner posts they can support up to 150 pounds which is more than enough given the age range who ll be using it another great thing about this sandbox is it s really easy to convert into a garden box once the kids have outgrown it just replace the sand with high-quality dirt plant seeds and let nature take care of the rest anything that has a future outside of its intended purpose is always worth considering recommended ages not stated while the outing play and swingsets with sandbox isn t for everyone due to the high buy-in price it s too good not to mention while sandboxes are fun figuring out how to get your child into exercise is also important as any fitness expert will tell you the best way to get a child active is through play if it s fun they won t even notice how tiring it is that s where the outdoor play sandbox comes in not only is there a sandbox with a solid amount of headroom you ve also got two swings a slide a climbing rope and a trapeze should you be worried about durability this set is made from cedar wood which naturally resists rot decay and insect damage the only downside here is the roof section isn t going to keep the whole thing dry so if the heavens do open up kids won t be able to play admittedly that s not the biggest downside in the world but it s worth keeping in mind recommended ages 3 and up what s better than a hexagonal sandbox easy an octagonal sandbox this wooden backyard sandbox has a width of 78-inches this thing is huge and can hold a total of 1000 pounds of sand enough to fill a beach practically as with all good sandboxes this wooden backyard sandbox outdoor octagon is made from three-quart-inch cedar timber meaning it s designed to last several years what s more and i m quoting

you re in luck the nanapluz 40-inch fir wood kids beach cabana sandbox is the best of both worlds a uv-protective sheet covers the top should you need to get out the sun while the underneath pulls out to reveal a modest-sized sandpit although this isn t the largest sandbox on this list the option of being able to quickly pack it away is sure to please a fair few parents likewise the fact this set is on wheels means it can be maneuvered to wherever the child desires without needing to deconstruct the whole thing it s time-saving and practical recommended ages 3 months and up the costzon kids foldable cabana sandbox has a really neat feature every other sandbox should steal fold back the wooden lid angle them upward and you ve got two benches sandboxes need something to cover the sand so it doesn t get wet when it rains so why not have the cover turn into something useful like seats it s ingenious what s more this sandbox is made from heavy-duty fir wood and is coated in non-toxic paint in order to ensure children s safety recommended ages 3 and up this is probably the most obvious statement you ll read today but the step2 naturally playful sand water activity center comes with both a sandbox and a waterbox why is this important well the vast majority of sandboxes don t include a water play area if you think back to what bath time was like when you were younger hopefully you ll remember the sheer joy of being able to dunk toys and splash about without a care in the world this set is most likely the closest you get to going to the beach without ever needing to leave the house not only does this set come with an umbrella to keep out the sun but there is also a plastic lid that can be placed over the sandbox and water areas to create a small table so even though this is primarily a sandbox it also doubles up as a table that s perfect for playing or drawing on recommended ages 36 months to 12 years in a nice twist the little tikes turtle round sandbox is in the not going to bankrupt you category there isn t really much to pick fault with here it s affordable looks nice and does the job it s meant to yeah okay it s not the most eye-catching or exciting sandbox you ve ever laid eyes on but i m certain kids will love it nonetheless just be warned it weighs around 16 pounds when there s sand in it it will be much heavier but if you don t clean every last grain of sand out there s a high chance a child could knock it over and you ll need to vacuum up sand for the remainder of your life it s not a deal-breaker but something that s worth keeping in mind recommended ages 2 and up there s nothing wrong with opting for a cheaper alternative to the goliath-sized sandboxes if you re after something more compact that ll stay mostly inside there s always the step2 naturally playful sand table this set in particular has a few neat features going for it first up the top that covers the sand when it s not in use has a racetrack built in for tiny cars this isn t revolutionary by any means but it s still a nice idea that s sure to keep the kids entertained next we have the actual design of the sandpit which is plastic but has a wood design embossed into it if you take a look at the legs you ll notice that they re rounded which means they re better for absorbing impact should a child bump into it lastly it comes with two shovels two rakes and a bucket so there s no need to buy anything extra apart from sand of course recommended ages 2 to 5 years not all sandboxes need to be elaborate or expensive sometimes a good idea can go a long way the costzon pirate boat wood sandbox is a good idea done well who doesn t want to build sandcastles from inside a pirate ship if you re after something more compact but still fun for kids this sandbox is definitely worth your consideration included is a black sheet of fabric which sits under the ship when it s time to tidy the sand away all you need to do is move the ship then fold the fabric and drip the sand back into its container handy in an interesting twist this design features a bottomless box should you decide there isn t enough sand in the box you could choose to dig up a trench under the sandbox and fill that with sand to help with drainage of course not everyone is going to want to excavate their backyard just for a sandbox but the option s there should you want it much like the costzon kids foldable cabana sandbox this pirate ship sandbox is also made from heavy-duty fir and coated in environmentally friendly non-toxic paint recommended ages not stated this plum store-it wooden sand box with storage bench and seating is another good option if you re looking for something a little cheaper what s also great about this is how much more compact it is when compared with other sandboxes that said if you re looking for a more robust sized sandbox that s capable of housing multiple children this ain t it chief in case you didn t spot it this sandbox also comes with a neat little storage area again this isn t going to be huge but if you re storing a bucket spade or watering can it shouldn t be a problem at all it s also recommended for any child over 18 months so if you re after something for a toddler this is the one to go with the naomi home kids canopy cedar sandbox with benches is one of the more simple sandboxes on this list but if you re after a more affordable sandbox you can t go wrong with this one despite the lower price-point this thing holds up thanks to the heat-treated stained cedar wood and rust-resistant hardware as with a few of the sandboxes on this list it also comes with two benches which fold over to cover the sandpit it should be noted the benches only support up to 150 pounds each that s fine for kids not so much for adults looking to get out of the sun this may not be the largest sandbox ever but if you re after something for a younger child that won t break the bank this is definitely worth considering i would recommend thinking about replacing the canopy however there are a fair few customers who have had issues with it becoming frayed and generally not staying where it should recommended ages not stated whenever purchasing a sandbox there are several factors you need to consider first always pick a strong wood cedar timber is popular with sandbox manufacturers because of its durability likewise fir wood also has its place just keep in mind the higher the quality the more it ll cost you can get cheaper sandboxes but there s a high chance they won t last as long it all comes down to how long you plan on using it for the more expensive sets are best for when they re really young while the midrange as the best option for if they re approaching double-digits if you re wondering why sandboxes are increasing in popularity there s one simple reason exercise kids are full of energy and love running around and getting them into exercise early helps reduce the risk of type two diabetes in later life and is also said to help a child s self-confidence and belief teaches them how to play with others and generally leads to more positive behavior another area of importance to keep in mind when selecting a sandbox is uv radiation as your child or children will most likely be playing with this outside you have to factor in sun damage not just to the skin but to the eyes prolonged exposure to the sun causes eye damage including cataracts macular degeneration pinguecula pterygia and photokeratitis so when we say it s worth spending a little extra to get a canopy included to block out the sun s harmful uv rays we really mean it with all that said let s take a look at some of the best sandboxes out there disclaimer heavy inc. is a participant in the amazon services llc associates
