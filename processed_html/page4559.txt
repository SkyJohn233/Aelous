Former Stoke City striker Dave Kitson has pulled off the coup of landing a weekly column in The Sun, the first of which dredged up an episode from back in February 2010. But how on earth did he persuade The Sun to employ his services... AGENT: Hello, is that the Sun sports desk? SUN: Yes, how can I help? AGENT: I represent Dave Kitson. SUN: Oh yes, remember him, great career with Derby, Newcastle and Leicester. AGENT: Not Paul Kitson, Dave Kitson. SUN: Dave? AGENT: Yes Dave. Cambridge, Reading, Portsmouth. SUN: Cambridge? AGENT: And  Stoke City , when Tony Pulis was manager. SUN: Oh yes. AGENT: I’d like you to  give him a weekly column . SUN: Right. Well, with all due respect, he’s er, he’s not much of a name, is he? AGENT: You do know he hated Pulis and his time at Stoke? SUN: Rings a very distant bell. Go on. AGENT: Well, Dave wouldn’t be averse to slagging him off for you, particularly in his first column. SUN: Pulis baiting? Hmm, been done to death really my old fruit. AGENT: Dave would quite happily say that Stoke’s nastiness was down to Pulis. SUN: Getting warmer, but still not sure that would cut it, to be honest. I mean Stoke. No-one cares now they aren’t in the Premier League. AGENT: Dave has plenty to get off his chest. SUN: You mean a bitter axe to grind? AGENT: Call it what you like, but your readers will love it. SUN:  Stoke City , though? AGENT: He’ll kick off by saying Pulis was ultimately responsible for Aaron Ramsey’s... SUN: Aaron Ramsey. You mean Arsenal? AGENT: Yes. SUN: Well why didn’t you say. When can you and Dave pop in to see us. AGENT: We’re parked outside. SUN: But let’s not rush things, let’s think through the consquences. AGENT: Such as? SUN: Well, is it fair on the guy who broke his leg. What was his name? Ray, Ryan... AGENT: Shawcross. Oh don’t worry about him. Arsenal fans hate him, even after all these years. SUN: Yes, they do, don’t they. I think we might have a deal. AGENT: I think we Gunner have some fun. SUN: As long as Dave doesn’t mind hitting the target. AGENT: Oh yes, he’s quite good at that, now he’s stopped playing.
