'Put a price on my talent / I hit the bank and withdraw' If ' i ' dampened your expectations for Kendrick Lamar's new album, a soul-searching but very radio friendly track, this new one he performed on The Colbert Report this week should get you sufficiently stoked. Holding a hip flask and spitting through the smoke on a dimly lit stage, Kendrick talked about race, survival and not pandering to record labels in the song, which featured a saxophone solo from Terrace Martin (who fans might remember from  Ab Soul's Outro  on Section.80). Instead of using a verse-chorus structure it feels almost like a Biblical story, with Kendrick talking about advice received from people of different ethnicities. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines An Asian man tells him to focus on his health rather than his career, an Indian man suggests he invest in real estate, a black man tells him "nookie is power" and a white man sees him as an ATM. The track reaches a climax with Kendrick shouting "Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply", echoing the words of Bebe's  Kids . The untitled song could well feature on Kendrick's  new album , which was expected at the end of 2014 but now looks like it'll be out next year. Genius  users pieced together the lyrics, which are as follows: [Intro: Kendrick Lamar] So I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said  " You know what, girl? You crazy. "  Then she asked me what he said... [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar  & Mani Strings ] ( What did the Asian say? ) " A peace of mind " That ' s what the Asian said—I need a divine Intervention was his religion and I was surprised Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God Asked him what are you doing, he said  " taking my time " Meditation is a must, it don ' t hurt if you try See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself Worried about your career, you ever think of your health? [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar  & Mani Strings ] ( What did the Indian say? ) " A piece of land " That ' s what the Indian said—I needed the man Telling me longevity is in the dirt Should buy some property first Should profit a better dollar with generational perks Equity at his best, really, you should invest These tangible things expire, don ' t you expect Income with so much outcome and yes Look at my heritage, we blessed ( Now, what the black man say? ) " A piece of pussy " That ' s what the black man said I needed to push me To the limit, to satisfy my hunger We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach What you saying to me?

He said it don ' t even matter You make a million or more, you living better than average You losing your core following, gaining it all He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars " Look at what you accomplishing " ; what he said to the boy " I ' ma make you some promises that you just can ' t ignore Your profession anonymous as an artist if I don ' t target your market If you ain ' t signing your signature when I throw you my wallet A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet Your world tour, your master ' s, mortgage, I need a piece " [Saxophone Interlude: Terrace Martin] [Hook: Bilal] I holler,  " What you do?
