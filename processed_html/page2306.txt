Bob Larson Casts Out Dustly The Demon | Zack Hunt This is a really disturbing video for a variety of reasons   mostly because it involves Bob Larson. But what I m really curious about here isn t whether or not this woman was possessed by a demon, but rather  how much did Larson charge to cast that  demon  out of her ? However much he charged, it was more than Jesus charged to drive out demons. Just saying. [youtube 7pQqvkqMGhs] ( Found at Christian Nightmares )               Why does  Dustly  from Egypt sometimes have a British accent?   This would actually be quite funny if it wasn t so infuriating. Bob Larson is continuing the scam game he started years ago on his radio show. Different schtick   same game.  Your email address will not be published.
