information viral modification of dendritic cells dcs may deliver a x0201c danger signal x0201d critical to the hyporeactive dcs in cancer patients using three highly differentially expressed hepatoma tumor-associated antigens taas stem cell antigen-2 sca-2 glycoprotein 38 gp38 and cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1 rabp1 we explored the therapeutic potential of the dcs modified with lentiviral vectors lvs preventive and therapeutic injection of the lv-taa-dc vaccine into tumor-bearing mice elicited a strong anti-tumor response and extended survival which was associated with tumor-specific interferon- x003b3 and cytotoxic t cell responses in vivo elimination of the lv-taa-dcs by a co-expressed thymidine kinase suicide gene abrogated the therapeutic effect the modification of dcs with lvs encoding multiple taas offers a great opportunity in cancer immunotherapy despite major advances in the development of cancer immunotherapeutics cancer vaccines in the form of peptides proteins and dna either alone or with adjuvants have illustrated limited success recent insight into the role of dendritic cells dcs as the pivotal antigen-presenting cells apcs has provided the basis for developing more effective immunotherapy regimens 1 x02013 5 there is known immunological defect in cancer patients involving either cancer cells or patients x02019 own immune cells such as tolerogenic dcs and t cells cancer patients may have established immune tolerance to the cancer cells 6 in addition a growing body of literature points to restrictions in activation and/or maturation of dcs from the tumor bed of hosts 7 8 the rationale for using ex vivo-generated dcs as cancer vaccines is that dc vaccines may break the tolerance to the overburdened cancer antigens in the patients and induce a strong anti-cancer immunity dcs process and present antigens through different pathways which leads to a balanced host immune response direct loading of antigenic peptides to dcs is an effective way to induce specific immunity 9 10 but is major histocompatibility complex mhc type-restricted and the peptide x02013 mhc complexes only engage t cells for short term 11 a recent clinical trial using bone marrow-derived dendritic cells pulsed with multiple peptides specific to malignant melanomas has failed to show benefit to the stage iv cancer patients this result suggests that further immune modulation of the cancer patients x02019 dcs is required 12 an alternative approach to present cancer antigens is to pulse dcs with cancer cells or recombinant proteins 13 14 however the latter is limited by the availability of large amount of cancer antigens that can be loaded to dcs to overcome these limitations many non-viral and viral gene transfer technologies for modifying dcs have been developed 2 13 15 16 recently hiv-1 derived lentiviral vectors lvs have emerged as powerful tools for gene delivery to a variety of dividing and non-dividing cells including dcs 17 x02013 19 lvs have been shown to target dcs with high efficiency with little to no cytotoxicity and the transduced dcs still retain their immunostimulatory potential 17 20 we have reported that human monocyte-derived dcs can be efficiently transduced and modified by lvs and the altered dcs can induce a strong t helper type 1 th1 response 21 hepatocellular carcinoma hcc is a major health problem worldwide causing half a million deaths per year 22 limited treatment options for this cancer results in a poor prognosis therefore novel therapeutic strategies and a better understanding of hcc immunobiology are urgently required using murine hepatoma 1mea7r cell line and its parental hepatocyte cell line bnl.cl2 as a model system we have applied a modified suppression subtractive hybridization ssh cdna screening method and identified a few highly differentially expressed murine hepatoma antigens among the highest expressed tumor-associated antigens taas include stem cell antigen-2 sca-2 glycoprotein 38 gp38 and cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1 rabp1 23 these three taas are unaltered x0201c self x0201d antigens and therefore preexisting immunological tolerance to these antigens may exist in vivo self-antigens have been used as cancer antigens to induce anti-cancer immune responses as reported in several clinical trials 24 x02013 27 the main goal of cancer immunotherapy is to enhance immunogenicity of cancer antigens or to break host x02019 s cancer tolerance one way to achieve this is to modify dcs with lvs to induce a strong anti-cancer immune response in vivo modification of the antigen presentation process and the immune modulatory functions of dcs using efficient gene transfer technologies may help induce a strong anti-cancer response in this study we have adopted a x0201c multi-antigenic x0201d approach by modifying dcs with lvs expressing multiple taas as cancer vaccines which may overcome possible strong tolerance toward any single taa 28 we present evidence that an effective cancer vaccine can be developed based on the multiple lv-taa-dcs this lv-taa-dc vaccine approach induced a strong anti-cancer immune response that may serve as a model system for future clinical applications female balb/c mice 6 x02013 8 weeks old were purchased from the jackson laboratory bar harber me and housed in the animal facility at the

vectors the full-length cdnas of three highly differentially expressed tumor-associated antigens that have been previously identified using an improved suppression subtractive hybridization cdna cloning method 23 mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells bmdcs were cultured and transduced with the three lvs as illustrated in fig 1 the dcs were generated from mouse bone marrow using a previously described method with minor modifications 31 dcs can be efficiently transduced with lvs as we have recently described 21 34 to verify the lv gene transfer the mock-transduced and the lv-transduced dcs were analyzed by flow cytometry the untransduced bmdcs expressed dc surface markers and t cell costimulatory molecules including cd11c mhc class i h-2k d and ii i-a k cd40 cd80 and cd86 fig 2a after lv transduction the dcs exhibited slightly increased expression of mhc class i and ii molecules cd80 and cd40 fig 2b to verify the lv transgene expression we examined sca-2 expression after lv-sca-2 gene transfer by flow cytometry the surface sca-2 expression in bmdcs was undetectable before lv transduction but increased expression was detected 4 days after lv infection fig 2c to determine the dose effect of lv transduction of mouse bmdcs we infected the bmdcs with lv-sca-2 at four different mois 1 5 20 and 40 and examined sca-2 expression by flow cytometry 4 days later at 40 moi more than 25 of the dcs expressed high levels of sca-2 without obvious cytotoxicity fig 2d and data not shown the actual transduction efficiency is presumably higher than that detected by flow cytometry based on our previous assay using a sensitive reporter gene placenta alkaline phosphatase 21 sca-2 expression was the highest of the three taas in the 1mea7r hepatoma 23 to compare the expression levels in bmdcs we transduced immature dcs with lv-sca-2 lv-gp38 lv-rabp1 and control lv-nlacz and rna was harvested 48 h later and analyzed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr the results show that sca-2 expression was consistently higher than gp38 and rabp1 fig 2e the target cancer antigens in our study are three highly expressed non-altered self-antigens sca-2 gp38 and rapb1 the immunogenicity of self-antigens might be low and the antigen-specific t cell clones could potentially have been deleted or tolerized to examine the immunogenicity of these three hepatoma taas in vivo we vaccinated mice with bmdcs transduced with all three lv-taas lv-taa-dcs weekly for 2 weeks and harvested the splenocytes 10 days after the second vaccination specific t cell response to the individual antigen was analyzed using the normal hepatocytes bnl.cl2 which were transduced with the lvs encoding the individual taas as target cells we verified the expression of the taa genes by rt-pcr using specific primers fig 3a shows the detection of sca-2 gp38 and rabp1 rna in both the lv-transduced bnl.cl2 p and 1mea7r hepatoma cells t no taa rna was detected in untransduced bnl.cl2 cells n to examine taa-specific response in vivo we pooled splenocytes from the same group of vaccinated mice and co-cultured them with bnl.cl2 taa-bnl.cl2 or 1mea7r for 16 h and measured specific immune response by intracellular cytokine staining for ifn- x003b3 or tnf- x003b1 co-stained with surface cd8 and cd4 antibodies fig 3b and c the result illustrated different cd4 and cd8 responses to the individual taas rabpi induced a strong cd8 and cd4 t cell response and gp38 elicited a strong cd8 t cell response and an intermediate cd4 t cell response interestingly sca-2 appeared to be the least immunogenic among the three taas which elicited a weak cd4 and cd8 response nevertheless compared with unmodified bnl.cl2 cells all three taas were immunogenic in the transduced bnl.cl2 cells and elicited antigen-specific t cell responses in vivo to determine the potential of the lv-taa-dc vaccine bmdcs transduced with the three hepatoma-specific lv-taas were tested in a syngeneic balb/c hepatoma model two groups of mice 10 per group were immunized weekly for 3 weeks with 5 x000d7 10 5 dcs transduced with either lv-nlacz control or the three taa lvs the mice were then subcutaneously challenged with a lethal dose of 5 x000d7 10 5 1mea7r hepatoma cells 7 days after the last dc vaccination as illustrated in fig 4a after palpable the tumor growth was monitored every 2 days using a caliper fig 4b significant difference in tumor growth was noted between the control and the taa vaccine groups after 2 months the control dcs dc-nlacz failed to protect the mice from the hepatoma cell challenge while the lv-taa-dc injected mice dc-taa exhibited decreased rate of tumor growth fig 4c associated with prolonged survival fig 4d the prophylactic lv-taa-dc vaccination although effective did not reflect the cancer patient x02019 s clinical situations to test the lv-taa-dc vaccine in a preexisting cancer model we injected balb/c mice with 2 x000d7 10 5 1mea7r hepatoma cells and 6 days later immunized with the lv-taa-dc vaccines weekly for 3 weeks as illustrated in the diagram in fig 5a compared to the control mice receiving nlacz-dc injection the mice treated with lv-taa-dcs exhibited a significant delay in tumor growth which coincided with prolonged survival fig 5b and c in repeated experiments we observed significantly improved survival for mice receiving the lv-taa-dc vaccine after 1 x000d7 10 5 tumor cell implantation data not shown to engage t cells for immune stimulation dcs need to migrate to lymphoid organs such as the draining lymph nodes and spleen it has been reported that 10 2 x02013 10 3 antigen-presenting dcs in the spleen are sufficient to achieve protective levels of ctl activation in mice 35 to see if the lv-modified dcs could migrate to local lns in vivo we transduced bmdcs with a reporter lv-egfp and followed by subcutaneous injection at different time points we collected lymphocytes from the draining lns from the injection site and spleen and analyzed for gfp-positive cells by flow cytometry as shown in fig 6a 24 h after injection gfp-positive cells were found both in the lns ~1500 cells/2 x000d7 lns/mouse and spleen ~2000 cells/spleen but became undetectable x0003c 10 gfp-positive cells after 48 h. this is consistent with the report that dcs capture epidermal antigens and migrate to peripheral lns within 24 h 36 it is not clear why the injected dcs could not be detected after 2 days although the in situ mouse cd8 dcs are known to have 3 days lifespan in the spleen 37 to see if there were functional lv-dcs in vivo 48 h after subcutaneous injection we designed an in vivo lv-dc knockout experiment one week after tumor challenge three groups of mice were vaccinated with nlacz-dcs taa-dcs or taa-tk-dcs the taa-tk-dcs were co-transduced with the lv-taa and the lv-tk lv-tk encodes the thymidine kinase gene of herpes virus which is cytotoxic in the presence of gancyclovir gcv forty-eight hours after vaccination the mice were given gcv 10 mg/kg per day i.p for 3 days to induce apoptosis of the injected taa-tk-dcs the result showed that like the control group of mice nlacz-dc the taa-tk-dc mice developed tumor and no protection effect was observed fig 6b this data suggest that the lv-dcs are functional and necessary for the protective effect 48 h after injection taken together these data indicate that the lv-modified dcs retain the ability to migrate to lns and spleen in vivo and can induce a protective immune response tumor infiltrating lymphocytes tils are often indicators of improved clinical prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 38 39 to see if the survival rate correlated with the existence of tils in the mouse hepatoma model we performed t cell-specific immunohistochemistry staining on tumor tissue sections consistent with the survival data we found that the tumors from vaccinated mice were intensively infiltrated with t cells shown by anti-cd3 antibody staining fig 7a right panel as opposed to the tumor tissues from two of the control mice fig 7a left panel one of the concerns with strong anti-taa immune stimulation is the possibility of inducing an unwanted autoimmune response we did not observe any adverse effect in the lv-taa-dc vaccinated tumor-survival mice after continued observation for over 2 years the entire life span of the animal further examination of major organs liver lung brain heart and kidney revealed no infiltration of lymphocytes and no histological difference between the lv-taa-dc vaccinated mice and the normal mice after 1 year representative histological analysis fig 7b top panel anti-cd3 ab staining and bottom panel h x00026 e staining to confirm the existence of a systemic and specific anti-cancer immunity we examined cell-mediated immune responses in mice treated with the lv-taa-dcs at the endpoint of each experiment the splenocytes were harvested from the control and the lv-taa-dc injected mice we performed an ifn- x003b3 elispot assay to detect the anti-cancer specific immune response the splenocytes were harvested and co-cultured with either the cancer cells 1mea7r or normal hepatocytes bnl.cl2 after 24 h the splenocytes were removed and ifn- x003b3 production was determined the results demonstrated that when restimulated with the cancer cells splenocytes from the vaccined mice produced a significant greater number of ifn- x003b3 -secreting cells than that from the control mice but not when they were stimulated with normal hepatocytes or medium fig 8a to detect cancer cell-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte ctl activity we conducted a target cell-specific fatal assay 33 spleen t cells from the lv-taa-dc-injected mice were restimulated with the hepatoma cells for 5 days and tested for ctl activity against different targets as illustrated in fig 8b the results demonstrate that the spleen cells from lv-taa-dc primed vaccine mice displayed marked tumor-specific ctl activity while no significant ctl lysis activity was detected in the control nlacz-dc immunized mice these results confirm that a cancer cell-specific immunity can be induced by the lv-taa-dcs which only target the hepatoma cells but not the normal hepatocytes to determine the contribution of different lineages of immune cells to the anti-tumor immunity we blocked cd4 cd8 nkg2d mhc class i h-2k d /d d or class ii i-a/i-e molecules using specific abs in co-cultures of splenocytes and stimulator cells and performed iccs for ifn- x003b3 as shown in fig 8c cd4 cd8 and nk cells all contributed although to different extents to the ifn- x003b3 production as compared with the control unblocked immune cells the cd8 cells contributed the most from 50 to 72 to the hepatoma specific ifn- x003b3 production while cd4 t cells and nk cells only accounted for 19 and 10 respectively of the total ifn- x003b3 production blocking h-2k d /d d partially eliminated the ifn- x003b3 production by approximately 20 x02013 40 suggesting that h-2k d /d d -independent mechanisms also exist likely through the action of alternative mhc class i molecules or other mhc class i-independent mechanisms the i-a/i-e mhc class ii did not appear to contribute to any of the ifn- x003b3 -related anti-tumor response the lack of specific anti-cancer immune response in cancer patients is often associated with immune tolerance to the cancer cells cancer vaccines composed of cancer cells alone or cancer-specific genes proteins and peptides may not be sufficient to overcome the existing immune tolerance to break the tolerance it is necessary to introduce a x0201c danger signal x0201d in order to initiate a strong anti-cancer immunity such danger signals can be in the form of bacterial toxins or viral rnas in this study we modified dendritic cells with lvs that encode multiple cancer antigens these are highly differentially expressed hepatoma antigens identified previously by suppression subtractive hybridization cdna cloning 23 combining the three hepatoma antigens sca-2 gp38 and rabp1 we demonstrated an effective anti-cancer immunity using modified dendritic cells the mbmdcs transduced with lvs express high levels of transgenes with little to no effect on dc surface phenotypes however further analysis will be necessary to evaluate possible x0201c danger signal x0201d effects from lv transduction antigen concentration is a crucial parameter for the induction of a potent immune response transduction of dcs with viral vectors that have been engineered to express taas can result in high levels of transgene expression necessary for a strong immune response 16 various viral vectors including poxvirus 40 adenovirus 41 and conventional oncoretrovirus 42 have been used to genetically modify dcs lvs offer several advantages over other vectors for targeting dcs first they can efficiently transduce non-dividing monocyte-derived dcs as well as bone marrow-derived dcs 19 43 second lvs establish stable long-term infection with minimal cytotoxicity third lvs express the transgene of interest up to 9 kb without viral gene expression and do not induce unwanted viral immune responses 44 45 finally we have recently shown that dcs are amenable to genetic manipulations by lvs and can be modified to up-regulate its th1 functions 21 by evaluating both prophylactic and therapeutic properties of the lv-taa-dcs in the balb/c hepatoma model we demonstrated a strong protection against the syngeneic hepatoma 9 out of 15 mice challenged with cancer cells after vaccination remained tumor free for 140 days 10 out of 15 mice with a pre-established tumor did not experience additional tumor growth for more than 120 days however not all of the mice were protected from the lv-taa-dc vaccines it is possible that cancer antigen epitopes are not efficiently recognized by host immune cells due to the immune escape functions of the cancer cells such as the expression of immune suppressors the up-regulation of apoptosis signals and down-regulation of mhc x003b2 2-microglobulin or peptide transport proteins tap-1/2 6 46 47 using all three taas for dc modification our approach entails the co-delivery of multiple cancer-specific antigens to induce a broad range of anti-cancer immunity dcs may be modified by lvs encoding additional immune modulatory molecules to overcome the intrinsic immune suppression from the tumor cells using human monocyte-derived dcs which are transduced with lvs encoding ifn- x003b3 and il-12 we have detected a strong th1 response in a dc t cell co-culture system 21 it has been reported that the injected dcs do not migrate as efficiently as the resident dcs in situ from the skin to the draining lymphnodes 36 48 however the in vivo tracking experiment showed that the lv-taa-dcs can migrate to the local draining lymphnodes within 48 h of vaccination this could be due to the status of the dcs transduced with lvs which may have activated the x0201c danger signal x0201d mechanism that promotes the dc migration by using the suicide tk gene-modified dcs we demonstrated a direct correlation of the viability of the dc vaccine with the ensuing animal survival the dc vaccine needs to be viable for at least 48 h to be effective this confirms that a prolonged engagement of the dc vaccine within the host immune system is necessary for the efficacy of the vaccine the taas are non-mutated self-antigens and could be expressed in normal tissues and cells targeting these antigens by modified dc vaccines may induce immune responses against normal organs and tissues leading to autoimmune diseases however we did not observe any abnormal autoimmune responses in the vaccinated mice tumor-free mice remained healthy for more than one and a half years possibilities of autoimmune responses were also studied by immunohistochemical staining of major organs of the vaccinated mice we did not find any abnormal histological phenotypes or t cell infiltrations in the organs of the vaccinated mice this does not exclude the possibility that mild autoimmune reactivity might have occurred early during vaccination however abnormal autoimmune diseases or related symptoms were not observed in any of the vaccinated mice these results indicate that the lv-taa-dc vaccination approach can induce a strong anti-tumor immune response while at the same time without provoking a harmful autoimmune reaction the contribution of different lineages of immune cells to the anti-cancer immunity of the dc vaccine is delineated using the antibody blocking assays it appears that the protective immunity elicited by the lv-taa-dc vaccine is primarily consisted of cd8 t cell response and less dependent on the mhc ii-mediated immune reaction if so the mhc class i-restricted cancer-specific epitopes must serve as important anti-cancer immunogens to identify potential mhc-i taa peptides we searched for h-2k d binding nanomer peptides from each of the taas sca-2 crabp1 and gp38 using the syfpeithi program http //sypfpeithi.bmi-heidelberg.com/ the peptides were screened for proteasomal cleavage sites using the netchop program http //www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netchop the best-fit epitopes of the three taas that fulfill both criteria with the highest affinity score were synthesized and tested to determine whether the selected peptides could stimulate cd8+ spleen t cells from the taa-dc vaccinated mice intracellular cytokine staining for ifn- x003b3 was performed interestingly all three predicted epitopes from the three taas failed to stimulate cancer-specific cd8 t cells from the lv-taa-dc vaccinated mice data not shown this corroborates the recent report of the lack of anti-cancer efficacy with peptide-loaded dcs in treating melanoma patients 12 it is possible that the predicted epitopes do not represent the best antigenic epitopes in vivo or that the selected epitopes are not sufficient to induce a strong anti-cancer response as compared with the whole antigens that are expressed by the lvs our studies strongly suggest that for the best vaccine efficacy the presentation of the full-length antigen may be necessary future studies should aim at optimization of the dc immune functions to overcome existing cancer tolerance the combination of lv-taa-dcs and the ssh method of identifying highly differentially expressed cancer antigens represents an important first step toward defeating the most immune resilient cancers we thank x. chen and w. chou for technical assistance and g. eubanks for
