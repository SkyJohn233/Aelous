The Michigan coach criticized his Ole Miss counterpart after Freeze said he wasn’t upset with the NCAA Division I Council’s vote last Friday to ban satellite camps because Freeze appreciated the opportunity to spend more time at home with his family. That didn’t sit well for the combustible Harbaugh. “You’ve got a guy sitting in a big house, making $5 million a year, saying he does not want to sacrifice his time,”  Harbaugh told Sports Illustrated’s Michael Rosenberg.  “That’s not a kindred spirit to me. What most of these coaches are saying is they don’t want to work harder.” Freeze  had planned to conduct satellite camps  in Atlanta, Dallas and Houston this summer but is happy he’ll have a chance to only do camps on campus. “I’m selfish with my time,” he said last Saturday. “I’m away from my family enough, and I just did not want to go. I was ready to. We would’ve jumped in with the rest of them and gone to work. But I’m glad we can have a camp and I can sleep at home.” Satellite camps provide high school athletes a cost-effective way to be seen by college coaches as they hope to earn a scholarship and to receive high-level coaching. Coaches also have a chance to judge a player’s frame, something that can’t always be done watching video. Satellite camps rose in prominence in recent years after several programs, including Michigan and Penn State, began conducting them outside of their geographic footprint. Schools from certain Power 5 conferences had been allowed to conduct camps solely in their state unless their coaches served as “guest instructors” at a satellite camp set up by another school. The Atlantic Coast Conference and Southeastern Conference had banned their coaches from working at such camps outside  a 50-mile radius from their campus. Freeze's comments also drew ire from various sports media pundits, most notably  Mike Greenberg of ESPN Radio's "Mike  &  Mike in the Morning" as reported by Saturday Down South web site . Said Greenberg Tuesday morning: “Hugh Freeze’s comment is enough to make you want to smash your head into a wall. ... One of the reasons he’s happy that satellite camps are banned is as quote: ‘I’m selfish with my time. I’m away from my family enough that I just did not want to go. We would’ve jumped in with the rest of them and gone to work, but I’m glad we can have a camp and sleep at home.' “Well thank God for that, Hugh. Thank God you and your millions of dollars can sleep in the huge house that you live in while these kids who cannot afford to get to all of these different places – cannot afford to go to Athens, Georgia, to get to your camp – could previously have gone to one spot near where they lived and had the opportunity to work out in front of a whole lot of coaches. But thankfully you can sleep in your bed while those kids may not get a change to get a college scholarship. I’m so relieved by that. I am so glad the NCAA took that into account when making these decisions.” Contact Daniel Paulling at dpaulling@jackson.gannett.com. Follow @DanielPaulling on Twitter.
