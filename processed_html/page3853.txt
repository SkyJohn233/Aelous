(@HuaweiZA)  2019-11-28 07:57:33                     @CellC hi, I won the 3000 smart phone voucher to buy one on take a lot. The voucher is not working. Help!!                                            (@malzymal826)  2019-11-27 22:20:57                     @CellC_Support Everytime I make calls, just after few seconds while on the call. It says ‘call failed’. I phoned CellC with the issue and I was told to reset my network settings - I did just that, but still the situation hasn’t changed. Then I phoned again today and I got rude replies.                                            (@nakedirapudi)  2019-11-27 14:44:08                     @CellC @CellC_Support For 3 weeks I haven’t been able to SMS  & amp; you can’t fix the problem. Don’t even have the guts to have an authorised person call me. All people, especially international travelers, I advise you to avoid Cell C! Worst network provider by far!                                            (@ezellefrancis)  2019-11-27 07:05:13                     @CellC @CellC_Support why cant i buy data via internet banking?
