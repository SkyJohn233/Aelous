Bubbles â€“ I Have A Dream Lyrics | Genius Lyrics (spoken) Every night I look up into the sky and search for a moving star I have a dream That I dream every night I look out my window C ' mon and let us go Oh oh oh oh I have a dream You can ask if I believe in heaven You can tell me that we ' re going to Mars I ' m just a little girl in a big big world It doesn ' t take much to make me happy In a little while we ' re giving you a smile C ' mon and fly with me I have a dream That I dream every night I look out my window C ' mon and let us go Oh oh oh oh I have a dream I ' m too young to think about tomorrow Life is full of magic every day I ' m just a little girl in a big big world All I wanna do is make you happy In a little while we ' re giving you a smile C ' mon and fly with me I have a dream That I dream every night I look out my window C ' mon and let us go Oh oh oh oh I have a dream That I dream every night Life is a fantasy Be what you wanna be Oh oh oh oh I have a dream (spoken) every night I look up into the sky and search for a moving star I close my eyes and wish I was with you take me to the place where you are I look out my window C ' mon and let us go Oh oh oh oh I have a dream That I dream every night Life is a fantasy Be what you wanna be Oh oh oh oh I have a dream That I dream every night I look out my window C ' mon and let us go Oh oh oh oh I have a dream
