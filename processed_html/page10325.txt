What I haven ' t been able to block are some " unblocked games " sites, especially ones that are on " Google sites " web sites. If someone could tell me how (if it ' s possible) to block specific " Google sites " web sites I would be grateful. I prefer to encourage students to use their time wisely of their own accord, but I ' ve been asked to do what I can to make game sites unavailable. Thanks, Steve < 1 2 > All Responses Answers Only BAlfson 0 13 Dec 2013 3:36 PM Steve, please show a few lines from the Web Filtering log file where students went to something you want to block. Cheers - Bob VincentVanier 0 13 Dec 2017 1:13 PM Trying here to block  https://sites.google.com/site/subgfyfs/ and not having much luck.  Tried entering this exact URL in the blacklist for a profile but it ' s not working.  Policy helpdesk says that Request URL: https://sites.google.com/site/subgfyfs/ Result:  Allowed URL Category:  Personal Pages URL Reputation:  Neutral Filter Profile:  Elementary Students Policy Name:  Base Profile I tried denying access to Personal Pages in the Elementary Students but it still goes through.  Base Profile has the site blacklisted.  I ' m at a loss. In reply to  VincentVanier : Vincent, please read the post just above yours. Cheers - Bob In reply to  FormerMember : Hi and welcome to the UTM Community! Please read my post just above Vincent ' s post. Cheers - Bob In reply to  FormerMember : Hi Inder and welcome to the UTM Community! Please read my post just above Vincent ' s post above.  No one can help you without more information. Cheers - Bob In reply to  BAlfson : In reply to  pkbenhtri kjmojong : Vincent can ' t even follow Vincent ' s entry.  Still not working for me.  Bob, I have no idea how to get information from those logs.  That ' s the worst part about this whole product.  Can ' t find anything from those logs.  I know the information is probably in there, but I have no idea how to get the information out of the logs to share with you. In reply to  VincentVanier : Vincent, the easiest way is to open WebAdmin, click on  ' Web Protection '  and then on the  at the top of the page so that you can see the Web Filtering Live Log.  In the  ' Filter '  box, put part of the URL you want to try and touch enter.  Now try the URL that isn ' t blocked.  Show us the line where your URL appears and the URL you tried. Cheers - Bob In reply to  BAlfson : Bob, I did as you suggested and found that the Web Filtering Live Log seems to  " quit "  after a short period of time.  Filtering does not work at all for some reason.  I can type the URL into the Filter box, but the log seems to be outputting whatever it likes in there.  Can ' t see the URL I ' m trying to filter in the log ' s output.  Is anyone else having this issue? In reply to  VincentVanier : If you don ' t see it in the Web Filtering log at all, it ' s not being handled by Web Protection.  What do you learn from doing #1 in  Rulz ? Cheers - Bob In reply to  FormerMember : In reply to  James Woakes : Hi and welcome to the UTM Community! If you are using Web Filtering in the Transparent mode, it ' s possible that Chrome and Android phones are accessing the server using UDP 443 instead of TCP 443.  You could create a firewall rule like  ' Any - >  {UDP 443} - >  Internet : Drop '  to force Chrome to use TCP. If you are using the Proxy in Standard mode (explicit proxy), you can add UDP 443 to  ' Allowed Target Services '  on the  ' Misc '  tab of  ' Filtering Options ' . In either case, you must not select  ' Do not proxy HTTPS traffic in transparent mode '  on the  ' HTTPS '  tab of the filtering Profile. You should now be able to block that URL effectively.
