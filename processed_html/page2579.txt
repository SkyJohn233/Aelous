Bonzer Alpha Omega Twin Fin | Board Locker I got this Bonzer Alpha Omega Twin shaped by none other than Malcolm Campbell himself.  Because there s no volume charts and not much press, I wasn t sure how the board was going to come out.  I love my FCD boards, so I had the board glassed there with the resin tint.  The board looks and feels absolutely amazing   super deep bottom concaves and cool outline.  A few things: the dims are 6 1, 20 1/4, 2 5/8.  One thing, this board is THICK. Compared to the regular shortboards and boards I ve been riding, this thing really carries the volume out to the rails.  it probably has 36-37L at least.  Malcolm and FCD recommended the TT fins, which is what I ve been using on it. Session Review: I ve only ridden it a few times, and each time I wished I would have gotten a 5 10 or something based on its outline and volume.  I ll keep updating this section when I get a good session on it.
