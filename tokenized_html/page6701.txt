b.c child care advocates hopeful 10-a-day slogan will become reality vancouver sun iglika ivanova is a senior economist at the canadian centre for policy alternative jason payne png victoria b.c child care advocates say they re confident the ndp government is still pursuing its election promise of 10-a-day child care even as the province dropped the slogan from its throne speech tuesday premier john horgan said it s still his goal to honour what he campaigned on in may 2017 namely to reach 10-a-day full-time child care 7-a-day part-time and free child care for low-income families to be phased in over 10 years however his government s throne speech made no mention of the targets or the 10-a-day slogan that was so prevalent throughout his election campaign that s our commitment that s what we re going to drive toward horgan told reporters tuesday but it s also important you remember that the 10-a-day label to drive the child care plan was put together not by the ndp but by child care providers academics and providers we ve embraced it and are going to implement it horgan said the plan that will be unveiled in full in the feb. 20 provincial budget has always been that the first three years are the ramp-up period where we re looking at toddler and infant care we re creating more spaces we re training more people and those elements will be in the budget story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below the 10-a-day title may have been dropped due to a disagreement with the b.c greens who are in a power-sharing deal with the ndp and oppose what they call the unnecessary slogan green leader andrew weaver said tuesday the ndp should simply be working on providing the best universal child care plan it can without the label horgan s throne speech tuesday promised the largest investment in child care in b.c history but with few details costs or timelines liberal opposition leader andrew wilkinson accused the ndp of abandoning its election promises on child care and housing this is a government that doesn t have the stomach to govern because they made promises they can not deliver on he said the throne speech is so completely lacking in substance that we are now concerned they are saving the rude surprises for the budget where they are likely to raise taxes an agreement b.c signed with ottawa late last week for 153-million in federal child care funding over three years did offer more clues including b.c s plan for a 1-million grant program for non-profit organizations municipalities universities hospitals colleges or schools to create new child care spaces as well as a boost in operational funds that would drive down costs in 2018 for child care spaces for children up to the age of three advocates of the 10-a-day child care plan welcomed the government s commitments regardless of the name there s a lot of new energy and new commitment coming to child care said sharon gregson of the 10-a-day child care campaign it s never happened like this before talking about turning a corner this is unprecedented provincial and federal commitment lt.-gov judith guichon arrives at the legislative assembly to deliver the speech from the throne in the legislative assembly in victoria b.c. on tuesday february 13 2018 chad hipolito the canadian press gregson praised the government s promise to introduce new legislation to give parents information on problem providers a move likely propelled by the tragic death of 16-month-old macallan saini known as baby mac at an unlicensed vancouver daycare last year she also endorsed the throne speech promise to convert unlicensed child care spaces to licensed ones saying it would lead to better quality options for b.c parents and ensure health and safety standards and proper monitoring and oversight are in place iglika ivanova of the canadian centre for policy alternatives said she was very optimistic about the direction the government was taking what is in the throne speech is encouraging said ivanova who authored a report on how the province can implement the 10-a-day plan either as a federal-provincial partnership or as a b.c.-only program but ivanova also said it s difficult to know yet if the government is actually on track to fulfil the 10-a-day promise it s hard to tell she said it s impossible to assess without seeing more details it looks like the key elements are here she said the 10-a-day plan is much more than just a commitment to reduce fees it is actually the shorthand for a system of integrated early child care and learning she said the whole idea is to build quality and affordability and increase spaces gregson would like to see details on wage enhancements for early childhood educators fee reductions and fee caps on child care spaces and target numbers for new spaces ivanova said she hopes the government will announce a timetable for the plan s rollout and offer bursaries for child care providers at unlicensed centres so they can get the training and credentials they need to transition to providing licensed child care she believes the plan can be phased in over eight to 10 years she also hopes to see meaningful funding commitments from the government along the lines of 250 million in the first year and a target of 22,500 new child care spaces over three years
