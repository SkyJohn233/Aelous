Tokyo Express - Arden, North Carolina - Japanese Restaurant, Chinese Restaurant | Facebook I called in an order at 6:05 they said it would take 20 minutes. I went in at 6:22 and they said it would be a  " few "  more minutes. Part of the order was ready but some of it wasn ' t. After another 20 minutes still not ready and the part that was is cold. I was told that they had lost my order and were just then making it. They did remake the cold food. After over an hour of waiting they give me my food and shorted me an order of crab rangoons. When I mentioned it they were not at all concerned. I left completely unhappy and without all of my order. I will not be going back! The lady working the front was so rude to me and my kids. I will never give them anymore of my money. Was so unprofessional and mean as a snake. I would not go there at all if I was you. So sad because they could of made a lot of money off of us. Now not a dime. This is a really good place to eat so if your out this way you need to stop in, Can you focus on me...... ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ Es hora del lonch More hibachi chicken, please?!
