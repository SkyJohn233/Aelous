co-conspirator in bratty behaviour bernard tomic are the sport villains that australians love to hate why because it x2019 s so easy kyrgios undoubtedly a talented tennis player has sworn on court smashed rackets revealed that x201c he x2019 s bored x201d playing the game that earns him millions on several occasions he has called for unnecessary medical breaks simply given up and has often shown little interest in competing against his opponent and then there was the time when he asked an umpire x201c can you call time so i can finish this match and go home x201d it x2019 s so easy to hate on kyrgios but i x2019 m going to suggest something let x2019 s not do that let x2019 s stop verbally bashing kyrgios and admit that we x2019 re actually not in a position to know why he frequently decides to act like a toddler who x2019 s dropped his ice-cream cone we simply don x2019 t know why kyrgios acts the way he does in much the same way that we didn x2019 t know why john mcenroe acted the way he did in the 1980s or up until recently why jelena dokic acted the way she did during her career media_camera media_camera in a recent interview with bbc4 mcenroe went some way to explaining his infamous on-court behaviour by saying that in addition to growing up x201c in a family of yellers x201d there was x201c an intensity from him mcenroe x2019 s father and an expectation from my mum i used to tell this story that my dad went to law school and finished second out of 450 people and my mum was like x2018 why didn x2019 t you finish first x2019 so there was this expectation of success from a very young age my mum and dad expected to do well x201d later on when mcenroe was long gone from the courts a young dokic was a rising star in the game and had enormous public support behind her she was seen as the prodigal refugee who made australia home and represented her new country at tournaments across the world she was the great hope of australian women x2019 s tennis and australians raised her as a goddess but then she appeared to fail to appreciate what she had been x201c given x201d and showcased her own version of bratty behaviour now of course we know the real story that dokic was a teenage girl being systematically physically emotionally and financially abused by her father and coach damir dokic who at the height of her career forced her to rescind her australian citizenship and play for yugoslavia now serbia and montenegro dokic x2019 s revelations x2014 in her book unbreakable written with sunday telegraph journalist jessica halloran and released late last year x2014 reframes her behaviour and how it was perceived by the public all those years ago it seems so unfair to think how this young woman felt being abused by her father and also knowing that her adopted country had turned its back on her media_camera through its current lens it x2019 s possible that kyrgios is the way he is because he x2019 s immature and fails to appreciate his good fortune and talent and makes a lot of crappy decisions but maybe there x2019 s something going on behind the scenes that he x2019 s struggling with and it manifests in his behaviour in public the fact is we don x2019 t know but knowing what we know now about dokic and even mcenroe i find it difficult to witness the onslaught of criticism that seems to follow kyrgios every time he breaks out into hysteria instead of jumping to conclusions and social media pile-ons let x2019 s take a step back if kyrgios chucks a wobbly he x2019 s free to do that there are people in international tennis who are already doubling down on him including mcenroe x2014 who recently labelled kyrgios x2019 s repeated tantrums as a x201c black eye for the sport x201d holding someone to account is different to what is currently happening kyrgios should absolutely be held to account but heaping abuse and nasty judgment isn x2019 t going to actually achieve anything sure he makes it extremely easy to dislike and write him off as a spoiled petulant brat maybe there x2019 s good reason for his behaviour maybe there isn x2019 t. but throwing embers into the fire has never made a fire less hot social-facebook_circle social-twitter_circle social-email_circle social-whatsapp_circle nav_small_down nav_small_down to join the conversation please log in do n't have an account
