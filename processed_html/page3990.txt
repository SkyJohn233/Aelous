ICHSA | Varsity Vocals Tickets for our 2020 Collegiate and High School tournaments are now available! If a link to purchase tickets for a particular event does not appear, please be patient; a few venues require us to sell tickets through their box office and in that case they may have not yet made ticket links available. Events will be added here as soon as they are confirmed. ICCA and ICHSA events begin in January 2020 in the US and UK and run through April. Check out our  events page on Facebook  and join your event to receive the latest information about it. View  results here  as they come in! Here's what events are coming up next.
