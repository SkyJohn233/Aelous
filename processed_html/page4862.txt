Miranda Kerr tries out her skills on the court as she poses in tiny gold shorts for basketball fashion shoot | Daily Mail Online         By                    Daily Mail Reporter               10:38 EST 03 May 2013                 , updated                 07:16 EST 07 May 2013         As one of the world's most in demand supermodels, she's used to having to wear an endless stream of weird and wonderful outfits. And Thursday was no different for Miranda Kerr as she embraced her inner Michael Jordan for a basketball-inspired fashion shoot for Vogue magazine. Trying out her ball skills in a pair of tiny gold shorts and a red T-shirt, the 30-year-old took over a court in New York City for the day as she tried to shoot some hoops. The mother-of-one, who had left husband Orlando Bloom and son Flynn back in LA, proved that she really is multi-talented as she stepped into character as a basketball pro.  Getting the look just right, Miranda tucked the maroon Michael Kors T-shirt into the waistband of the tiny pair of metallic shorts, rolling up the sleeves. In true sporting style she added sweat bands on her wrists and around her forehead and wore red safety pads on her knees. The model added a pair of white and grey tube socks pulled up high, paired with blue wedge trainers by the same designer. Clearly at top of her game, the star looked completely at ease with the shoot, taking it all in her stride and getting into the character. And in between shots, Miranda played around with the basketball she was holding, throwing it up in the air and attempting to dribble it around the court. The star wore her brown hair loose and slightly tousled and had been given minimal make-up on her face, keeping the focus on the stand-out outfit. Clearly finding what she was doing amusing, the Victoria's Secret star broke down in giggles at one point, perhaps realising that her ball skills weren't quite up to scratch. After the shoot, Miranda got changed into something a little more comfortable as she spent the rest of the day wandering around the shops. But even though she'd changed into ripped jeans and a simple camisole top, the model seemed to have kept all the jewellery on from the shoot. The star is yet to comment on speculation that she's parted ways with Victoria's Secrets after three years, but proved that she's just as sought after as ever. The comments below have been moderated
