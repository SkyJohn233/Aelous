How do you make a womanizer fall for you? | Yahoo Answers I know this sounds weird but this womanizer broke my best friends heart now I wanna break his! I know he has feelings for me but I &# x27;ve never been with a guy. It &# x27;s not that I &# x27;m ugly I &# x27;m just VERY shy. Anybody got some good advice for meh??!! :) I know it &# x27;s weird but any answers will be very helpful!!!  Thanx!!!!!!!! :D Don &# x27;t and sure as hell don &# x27;t waste your virginity on one. He &# x27;s a man and a womanizer, screwing him will be giving him what he wants. Breaking someones &# x27; heart requires a strong emotional connection, which takes a while to build, and it &# x27;s a double edged sword. The human psyche is devastating, it can cause people to fall in love with their captors (Stockholm Syndrome), captives (Lima Syndrome), and even abusers. You &# x27;d have to be Charming enough for him to fall for you, have acting skill to convince him you &# x27;re falling for him, all the while being mentally strong enough not to fall for him. It &# x27;s risky for YOU and very easily could be turned on its head, breaking your heart. Do you really feel confident enough to be so close and not fall for him when those sexually abused fall for their abuser? If you want revenge, don &# x27;t be poetic, be brutal. One could take advantage of a womanizers need to  " conquer "  and hook him up with a woman who has a nasty STD. Or perhaps if you take it literally... Anyways, it &# x27;s not worth the risk IMO. Don &# x27;t you think it &# x27;d be even more tragic if your heart is broken trying to break the heart of the man who broke your friends heart? Run away from this man, stay away. Once a man is considered to be a  " notorious "  womanizer, he will always be that way. If he was truly worried about stds he would not be a womanizer. If he is worried about stds that means he has be having condomless and brainless(thinking with the little head instead of the big one) sex on more than one occasion. If he has been having unprotected sex, and you have had unprotected sex with him, you have had sexual contact with everyone he has had sex with, and everyone they have had sex with....you need to be tested for stds and HIV/Aids yourself. Divorced and a bad marriage...does this really surprise you? He probably told his former wife he would give up the other woman and/or women and lied so she dumped him. He will never be true to one woman, if he was going to be he would &# x27;ve stopped acting like a hormonal teenager with no control decades ago. You need to think more highly of yourself than this womanizing loser. Have a good night. This Site Might Help You. RE: How do you make a womanizer fall for you?

Anybody got some good advice for meh??!! :) I know it & #39;s weird but any... if you &# x27;re shy, you can &# x27;t. to manipulate a womanizer, you have to be a man-eater.  this requires you to ooze sex appeal, which is 90% confidence, 10% appearance.  And of course lots of personality thrown in there too (goes with confidence because it makes you more interesting if you &# x27;re passionate about what you say).  also, you need practice before you take on such a task.  it requires skill, trust me, I &# x27;m doing it now.  not a job for a first-timer.  put it aside for now and learn how men work. use the internet. am a womanizer and I have really high standards, my standards are so high there as high as the sky. Girls cant and dont know how to pull me. If I do feel a spark of attraction for a girl but I dont want it to go any further I just stop meeting her. The only way a girl can pull me is by being very hard to get, I dont know why but knowing I cant pull a girl makes me want to pull her. The attraction would have to be there though from the start. This mission of yours is a waste of time, the world is full of guys, billions of them why would you want to sleep with this one? never ever do that! your friend might turn around and say you wanted to have every man she has trust me people change. you should use yourself to do this he will get his one day and its not up to you to do it. at some point in life  a girl that hes madly in love with wont feel the same and that will do it for him. karma is a ***** and what goes around comes around. it will happen when the time is right. besides him liking you doesn &# x27;t guarantee it will work why because hes a player he probably adding you to the list of his girls. You &# x27;d probably have to lead him on sexually. Other than that, I really wouldnt bother because those kind of guys aren &# x27;t worth it.  I would never give a womanizer any satisfaction. Womanizers do not have hearts so you cannot break it if you tried. You and your friend have to move on and let it go.  I hope you both do not get involved with that type of guy again. Offer him something, that all the others dont. If your unique , if your different and If he sees that he will forget about all the other women who are the same.  In turn making him think that you are special, Now you dotn ahve to have any of the qualities you show, since you want to hurt him, you just have to lie. Tell him exactly what he wants to hear.
