borderlands 2 vr could come to rift and vive in 2019 uploadvr copyright 2019 uvr media llc the small text of sony s latest trailer for borderlands 2 vr for psvr reveals an interesting fact- the game s exclusivity to the platform is timed not permanent specifically it is a timed exclusive for 5 months from launch at the bottom of the screen from the very start it states borderlands 2 vr is exclusive to psvr for a minimum of 5 months from launch this means that after that 5 month period gearbox could port it to pc vr platforms like oculus rift htc vive and windows vr if they wanted to that would mean may 15th 2019 is the earliest you d see borderlands 2 vr on a pc headset but since that s a wednesday i d wager may 16th or 17th at the earliest instead we d be shocked if borderlands 2 vr isn t ported to pc the non-vr game has enjoyed a long life thanks to the pc gaming community and there is nothing inherently tying borderlands to psvr other than whatever deal they ve arranged in the case of resident evil 7 vr i m less shocked it hasn t come to pc yet almost two years later just because of the history with that franchise on sony platforms borderlands 2 vr feels more like batman arkham vr or skyrim vr both of which eventually released on pc vr devices regardless you can play borderlands 2 vr later this year on december 14th when it releases on psvr as a timed-exclusive the game will support both dualshock 4 and dual ps move controllers both of which will have teleportation or smooth locomotion options for some developers porting an oculus rift or htc vive game to playstation vr is welcome to the daily sketch we ve teamed up with sketchfab and expert vr artist elizabeth get ready to take another tumble down the virtual rabbit hole alice vr is set copyright 2019 uvr media llc all rights reserved
