Offline Yes Offline Do you have this set in your kernel config http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/vpnc-howto.xml Code Listing 2.1: CONFIG_TUN TUN/TAP provides packet reception and transmission for user space programs. It can be viewed as a simple Point-to-Point or Ethernet device, which instead of receiving packets from a physical media, receives them from user space program and instead of sending packets via physical media writes them to the user space program. When a program opens /dev/net/tun, driver creates and registers corresponding net device tunX or tapX. After a program closed above devices, driver will automatically delete tunXX or tapXX device and all routes corresponding to it.
