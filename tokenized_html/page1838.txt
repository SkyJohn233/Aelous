the thought of painting them can make most people nervous especially if you mess it up but don t despair i will teach you how to paint your wood floors without any issues and i promise to help you every step of the way by the end of this article you will have the confidence and the knowledge to get it right the first time excited to learn an entire plethora of tips and tricks so am i so let s get this show on the road most wood floors can be painted yes even expensive teak flooring if you dare however you shouldn t never paint directly onto a glossy finish as this usually comes out looking bad your best bet is to test the wood that you wish to paint this can be broken into three easy steps each outlined later in more details first prepare a small area of the wood floor in the corner or under a couch secondly apply a small amount of paint to the wood and let it dry properly and finally check the results within 24 hours and look for any cracking peeling streaking or bubbling if it looks good then you can proceed with confidence if you do experience issues i invite you to leave a comment at the end of this article and i will help you myself pro tip 1 try get a paint that contains polyurethane this chemical adds strength and is great for slightly humid environments if you can t find one you can always apply a coat of polyurethane afterwards so don t worry about it while the color choice is completely up to you check out this pinterest board on wood painted floors for some ideas it s important that the paint color of your wood floors match your various interior design elements while it is possible to start over that won t be necessary if you spend some time doing some research beforehand this can actually be rather fun especially if you do it with your significant other or a friend sheen is the reflective quality of the paint although most floor coatings varnish etc have a sheen value i will keep this guide focused on colored paint there are four levels of sheen for wood paint and each has a different reflective quality defined by the percentages below starting from the shiniest they are glossy 75 semi-gloss 55 satin 40 and matte 20 house logic has a great article on this so check that out we have partnered with networx to help our readers get affordable quotes to paint their wood floors from contractors near them simply when people ask me for my honest opinion i usually recommend either satin or semi-gloss i personally think that full gloss doesn t fit well in most homes and the matte/flat sheen looks a bit dull most of the time on that note here are their pros and cons the amount of paint that you will need will depend on 3 factors the thickness of the paint if you are using oil-based paint you will need a larger quantity than a thinner water-based paint the thicker the paint the more is needed but on a positive note you won t need as many coats of it so it can even out in the end the area of the floor if you have large rooms the simple truth is that you will need more paint to cover them sufficiently as a general idea you ll need about a gallon to cover around 350 square feet for your painted wood floors so keep that in mind the number of coats if you need to apply two coats then you will need to double the amount of wood paint if you want a third coat for some reason then times the initial amount by three and so on there is a lot of confusion when it comes to applying a primer to wood floors especially when you are using paint let me help you understand this clearly and hopefully you can share this with your friends simply put if your floor still has its previous coating and there is no bare wood exposed you don t need to use a primer on the flip side if wear and tear that has stripped away parts of the previous finish you need to apply the primer to these areas this might mean that you need to prime the entire floor but don t do it unnecessarily as long as you are careful this can be a great diy project however due to affordable local contractors in the u.s sometimes it s not worth the time and effort so don t forget that pro floor tips can help you request a free quote if you prefer to go that route if you are going to try this yourself you will need the following tools and supplies for your painted wood floors please don t rush this step it could mean the difference between a successfully painted floor and a botched one once the entire wooden surface of your floors has been worked move onto the next step also make sure that you use the correct primer whether it be oil or latex based otherwise you will have less and desirable results allow your floor to dry overnight make sure that you clean up properly again otherwise your paint will end up containing dirt and other debris if you used a wet cloth recommended leave it to dry overnight hopefully you can see how important the preparation steps are even if you were a pro the correct preparation is critical and i encourage you to complete all the steps thoroughly in conclusion painted wood floors usually look absolutely gorgeous and can really bring life back to your old floors despite popular belief a good paint job can often look better than the wood underneath even it s your grandmother s prized walnut floor that has been there for generations the key to success depends on sufficient preparation especially when it comes to cleaning priming and scarring if you manage to get all that right the actual painting process is usually fairly easy thanks for reading this article and if you appreciated my time and effort please consider sharing it with your friends family and co-workers update i have just finished writing an article about refinishing hardwood floors check it out as another valid option to bring your older floors back to life thanks bill for your informative article i m getting ready to paint my floor and i have 1 question that you might be able to answer for me.i have always loved the look of painted wood floors that have been coated with a clear hard floor wax do you know anything about this process and how it is achieved i ve heard that the wax can make the floor very durable i m thinking that a matt paint might be the way to go and then add the wax dry and buff thanks again for your helpful article i d appreciate any helpful information if you have any sincerely nanette hi nanette it s a pleasure you can use a wax but make sure it s not place on a urethane finished floor otherwise it can become rather slippery waxing a floor finish can also void your finishing warranty if you have one other than those two pointers if you can get a high quality wax that s suitable for indoors feel free to do so it definitely looks good if it s done properly by an expert hey bill i am living in a house that has wooden floors these floors were painted by the previous residents in lime green glossy paint i know your article is about painting wood floors but i was wondering if you happen to know of a way to remove paint from wood floors so i can restore the floors to their former glory thanks hi tom lee yes it is possible to remove the paint but it is going to take quite a bit of time and effort on your part don t even attempt to do this by hand you will preferably need a belt sander that can usually be hired if you don t want to purchase one however on a positive note you will get to bare wood and once the entire floor has been done you can proceed with a decent finish etc and they will look great hope that helps edit i know you are asking about removing the paint but if you want you could also sand it a little bit and then apply a wood colored paint that will also work hi bill what do i have to do to my old wood floors that i painted with a high quality high gloss paint it still looks pretty decent after 6 yrs but i would like to refresh them they are a very light color that i really like can i just paint over them with another coat they seem to have dried out in spots and are cracking and starting to peel so i don t know how to handle that they are very old floors 1890 and the paint seemed to strengthen them appreciate your help hi carol yes you can however i definitely suggest prepping the floors first usually this involves a light sand etc not to bare wood though as this will make sure it turns out well hope that helps thanks for the comment hi bill i never comment but this is a great article i have a couple of questions but first of all i have an older home that i chose to rent out 6 yrs ago unbinounced to me they were very very dirty and had bad hoarding issues the entire house needed to be gutted of everything all plumbing bathrooms etc we live on a shoe string and were not prepared to deal with anything like this horror we finally found the old wood floors in every room i borrowed a floor sander and went to work- learning as i go i wanted to paint the floors but hubby wanted them natural- he thinks painted floors will always look dirty there are so many dark spots that i almost fixed vinegar bleach alcohol- lots of passes w the sander etc now i painted the stairs going to bedrooms with gray floor paint and they look dirty most of time construction sanding elsewhere but i tht a runner on the stairs would improve that both upstairs and downstairs hallways look the worse they all have concentrated areas of blackened wood that i am lost on so i want to fix these floors as soon as posssible without breaking the bank i finished the upstairs hall and caveman husband thinks its perfect but with the blackened area in front of bathroom all sanded stained poly shiney is an eye sore shd i sand down to bare wood and paint that hall downstairs i have worked w darker stain but it is not helping should i take the oil stain off and follow your directions or can the stain take paint is there a way to make the floors look like they are not painted and are wood like blending paint just on the bad spots still have dining room with horrible doorway floor horror- so prob paint that too sorry so long and if you cant help w ideas its ok- going to check out your reccomendation for floors on pinterest thanks for reading this also had the bedrooms looking great untill i did a light sanding after 2 polys- and they turned white- and contradicting advice said keep addind more coats floors have a light white film- husband says its fine- but i think i shdve washed w denatured alcohol between- maybe i will redo the 4 bedrooms w stain or paint i have been working to fix this for over a year and need to get it rented or sold asap any advice appreciated hi maryann thanks for your comment glad you enjoyed my article to answer your question it is possible to sand it down to the bare wood thus removing the stain paint or any other blemish on the wood floor but it will take time and effort i am not saying it is not worth it though and if it is what your husband wants use a belt sander and be prepared to be busy for a couple days depending on the size of the area after doing this you can get someone or you can do it to refinish the wood and that will result in that natural wood look alternatively if you decide to paint it there are some wood paints that look like wood so that might be an option bonus of this is that although you will need to prep the surface more sanding you won t need to sand down to bare wood i suggest you go to your local flooring shop and look at the wood colored paints before making a decision because painting is definitely easier hope that helps please share my blog on social media if you appreciated my help i painted my wood floors about a year ago they looked good for about 6 months but then after that the paint started chipping off do you have any tips for me to touch this up or should i strip it all off and follow your steps hi joel if the paint is chipping off in fairly remote corners of the room you can definitely do a light sand and touch up job however if it is flaking in a large visible area it might be worth sanding the entire room not your entire house and repainting it to ensure you get the uniform look you said in your article that it would be cheaper to paint old wooden floors i m trying to convince my wife that we should paint our floors rather then have them redone as i can t afford it could you help me win her over by giving me a cost difference in painting rather then refurbishing hi robert honestly i am sorry to say but refinishing and painting them usually works out to be around the same price of course there are many variables such as the type of paint you buy how many coats you need etc but yeah costing is fairly close however if your current wood floors are made up of cheap wood or you are looking for a specific color then most certainly paint can bring some luxury to them hope that helps such an informative article its exactly what i needed now that i have decided to paint my wood floors was wondering tho if i use traditional oil-based enamel wood paint how long on average will it take to dry as you mentioned that it takes a fairly long time to dry hi luca thanks for your kind words it varies on a product by product basis i find that it can sometimes take more than double the time but that figure is not set in stone just make sure that oil-based paint is the best option for your wooden floors though the alternative is very popular and might actually be your only option depending on where you live hope that helps loved your article i painted a wood floor and sealed with a water-based polyurethane once it dried there are some awful spots where the poly was thicker they are discolored and look horrible the floor was painted gray with white stenciling how do i fix this and do you have a colorless recommendation for a sealer over light colored paint the crystal clear sealants i have tried 2 different brands on 2 separate floors had the similar results are not actually clear also is there one that is not crazy expensive thank you hi e oh dear that sometimes happens when either the floor is not properly prepared sanded etc or when the actual paint application is not done in a uniform manner anyways you can try sanding the thicker areas with a fine grit and then touching it up with the paint as for the sealants check out the winmax range they have a website you can give them a call for future advise i am sure they will be happy to assist you with their product range bill just came upon your article .excellent thank you i have a staircase in my garage that is regular run-of-the-mill pine as such i decided the wood wasn t of high enough quality to stain so i decided to paint the treads black and the risers white i used a water-based sherwin williams satin finish for the treads i wanted to apply a clear top coat to toughen them up a little i emailed minwax s help page and they said that they do not make a product to top coat over paint only over stain could this possibly be true my take away from your article is that a polyurethane could be used as long as i use water-based over my water-based paint i ve seen that opinion on other sites as well your thoughts hi david appreciate the kind words you are correct i am not sure why they said that maybe it has something to do with their specific range in that case go with another brand as what you have researched is right can i put varnish on paint on shed floor design to seal hi denise yes you can just make sure that you do all the necessary preparation sanding etc to ensure that there is a strong bond between the varnish and the wood and that you choose a varnish that is suited for outdoors even though it is inside a shed it probably will still take a bit of a beating hope that helps thanks for popping by hi bill i really enjoyed your article my h easier to read than others i ve looked at i have some old cyprus pine floorboards throughout my old house i am renovating so it s all a bit if a mish-mash mostly they are covered in old oil based varnish but there are a few rooms with almost none left on them these were hidden under tiles and not re-done when the rest were some bare boards that i installed after removing a wall and one room with brand new boards that i covered with water based feast watson liming floor white i loved the look of the white but feel like it s too perfect for what i want and doesn t wear well pets and kids and renovating are a great test i am happy to see wear and tear but think it would look better on a painted surface my plan was to sand back the entire floor and paint however i noticed you mentioned only a light sand is needed i m thinking i would have to perhaps completely sand back that new varnish and scuff the rest then coat with oil based paint i would rather use water based nowhere to go to get away from the fumes any thoughts or ideas you could give me would be much appreciated thanks again for your article hi emma thanks for your kind words your plan sounds good a light sand is fine provided you give the next layer enough to grip to the floor and definitely go for a water-based paint however when purchasing it make sure it is specifically for floors as it has more resistance against foot traffic hope that helps hi bill i just moved to california from michigan and bought a condo the master br and living room have bamboo flooring different colors but light colors with the stupid dots on them i can not stand them and can not afford to replace i was going to try to sand and restain but i will never be able to match the colors so i thought about painting them a medium to dark grey they are not laminate and are in excellent shape should i sand with a machine to take the poly off kilz them 2 coats of paint with primer and then maybe 2 coats if poly or varnish would this work i have to have this condo ready to move into in 1 month living with kids with all my stuff in storage any help you could give me would be beyond appreciated thanks so much hi sharon yes that sounds like a good plan make sure that all the poly is removed before you start good luck let me know how it goes also sorry for the delayed response i have been off sick cheers hey bill just read your excellent article i m feeling confident to repaint my floors now that i have all the information that i need i have a question though you mentioned polyurethane what is polyurethane hi joey it is a pleasure poly is basically a finishing product that can add strength or even a gloss depending on the sheen quality you are looking for to your paint layer hope that helps hi great article i have one question i m going to paint wood floors that are in my attic they have never been finished they have no paint on them just bare wood do i have to sand them first thanks hi dom thanks for your kind words yes i would still recommend sanding them but only lightly won t take long bill i loved your article it s encouraging and i m gon na go for it ok so i have old pine floors craftsman home the floors were refinished 15 years ago and have a lot of wear they are natural in color and i want to paint them a much darker brown there are bits of finish left here and their too meshed together to spot prime or sand can i prime the whole floor also can i use wood filler where needed i want a deep tone brown that won t look whimsical any suggestions thanks for taking time to read my questions rosina hi rosina thanks for your kind words i suggest that you first fill those holes and then the entire floor properly if you go to bare wood use primer in those areas if the entire floor has been sanded to bare wood then yes you will prime the entire floor i love the darker look check my article on dark hardwood floors so maybe a teak looking color would look good your choice though it will look great best of luck and please share this article on facebook if you appreciate my response as it really helps me hi bill thanks for the

hundred years old one of the wooden floors is painted a turquoise color there is no gloss/poly on the painted floor i want to paint the floor a darker color can i follow the steps and just paint over the colored floor do i have to use a primer on the floors before painting the new color do i have to strip the old paint color off first thinking of using a latex paint hi marie provided that there is no exposed wood you won t need to use primer also based on your description of the existing paint yes you should be able to paint directly over it just make sure that you get flooring paint not just any paint also make sure its quality do not buy cheap rubbish love your article i pulled up the carpet in our cats room yes they 13 of them have their own room there are pee stains on the floor along

and then paint it according to the instructions listed here sounds like you understand it clearly you will be fine good luck can i use an oil based poly over latex painted floors hi kelly if latex has any gloss or shine to it you will need to sand it first not saying you need to get to bare wood but you can not just paint over it however provided that there is no gloss or finishing product on the latex painted floors you can paint directly over it hope that helps hi bill i had new solid hardwoods installed and wanted painted antique white in bedrooms pretty low traffic i followed these steps including priming unfinished wood with zinnsler shellac based primer ppg recommended their breakthrough paint which my floor guy sprayed on it perfectly matched after first coat of paint next day he put 2 coats duraseal water based poly the floor seems to be yellowing more as it dries what do you think went wrong hi lyn that is very strange honestly that shouldn t happen it should have dried by now what does it look like today hi bill i would like to know your thoughts on dry brushing an old hardwood floor to give it a faded washed look maybe in a dark color.marianna hi marianna i haven t done that in recent memory but i think it will work out nicely maybe check some guides on the net before you start and don t forget to send me some pictures thanks for your article it was very helpful i have a question about sanding i painted my floor with latex porch and patio paint in a diamond pattern now i want to seal it with polyurethane but i worked hard to get sharp lines on the diamonds and i m afraid sanding will ruin the design can i get away without sanding before applying the polyurethane hi kim yes that will be fine just make sure that you match the type of finish to the latex paint you used send me some photos when you are done sounds like it is going to look great bill thank you so very much for your very informative instructions i checked out several sites but yours was the most detailed i appreciate you time and effort in making my up and coming project seem achievable i have never painted hardwood floors but absolutely love the ones i have seen in magazines internet etc i am a lot nervous not a little nervous about painting my new wood floors that were laid last week the wood is of high quality and it is white oak i am wondering if white oak is different than painting let s say hemlock or red oak it has of course not been stained before so just making sure that all i need to do is sand the whole floor is that a light sanding or do i need to use 250 grit and go to 150 after that i think i got it i was wandering if i screwed it up just how big of a mess is it to resand and put a stain on it thank you very much for any comments hi cha appreciate your kind words it won t be much different honestly so don t worry about that if it has a finish you will need to lightly sand it then apply the flooring paint make sure its a quality brand and specifically for floors it is a major job to undo this but it is possible hope that helps hi bill my question is about adding a stencil design to wood floor and not painting the whole thing do i need to apply poly of something after stencil is completed hi thornton yes i usually recommend that for the entire room not just the stenciled area but do the design and see how it looks without it first thanks for the useful tips hi pier it is a pleasure bill thank you for the floor help we can t afford to re-do our master bath yet we just pulled the carpet out can we paint directly onto plywood sub floor stencil seal it until we can afford to do the bathroom properly will this ruin it for future tile hi stephanie yes but if there is any bare wood exposed don t forget to add a primer first no it won t affect your future tiling plans good luck i have hard wood floors that have never been painted they had carpet over them do i need to put a primer on first before painting hi debbie if the hard wood still has its old finish and there is no bare wood exposed from damage etc then you don t need to use a primer hope that helps you our kitchen has wood pergola flooring about 10 years old though scratches are showing and it s looking a little worn i like the reddish brown color and would like to paint large 18-ish black checkered squares what kind of preparation would i have to first do i can t imagine sanding my wood floor if i want to leave it partially exposed between the painted squares what about using polyurethane after all is finished just not sure how to go about it all thanks for your suggestions in advance hi paula i suggest that you a very light sand in the areas that you want those black checkered squares then apply the designs to the floor and depending on how it looks potentially refinish the entire floor to give it consistency hope that helps you hi bill i article is very informative i have a question for you once i have stained the steps what is the best thing to apply on them that will keep them from beening scratch hi winnie a quality finishing product will not only improve the appearance but also give the wood some protection hope that helps hi great post i had a question that lowe s couldn t answer and was hoping you could i painted my floor with oil based enamel that s meant for metal is this really bad i m concerned it won t stick or will create paint dust i wanted to pain the floor silver and they didn t have floor paint in that color hi hanna honestly i have never done that but i suggest that you leave it for now and see how it holds up also if you don t mind keep me updated i am sure that others in the community would like to know the result as well great article i bought a home that someone painted the wood floors reddish i want to paint black it will be high traffic as it is the living dining and kitchen areas i really would prefer water based and finished with a poly.do you think if i used a paint designed for floors and went over with a commercial poly it would hold up as well as an oil based hi shelby thanks for your kind words yes it will go for it hi bill first of all great article i ve spent a lot of time trying to piece together information on how to re-paint old wood floors but you did an excellent and very thorough job educating me on the process all in one article we want to re-paint old pine floors in little beachside cottage the existing floor is from around 1890 and has at least two layers of various paint colors my questions are the following 1 is it safe to assume that the old layers of paint are indeed lead i am only thinking this because of the age of the painted pine floorboards if so any recommendations to safely sand and wipe down i have small children and want to make sure it is safe i thought painting the floors was the least disruptive in kicking up dust but knowing i now have to sand the floors to give it teeth has me wondering 2 it will be high traffic wet sandy feet and in a variably humid environment new england summers and no a/c any recommendations on type of paint to use i prefer a more matte look 3 how long before the floor is gereally safe to walk on after painting looking forward to your reply thanks in advance hi armen thanks for the comment i suggest you sand that paint right off as i personally wouldn t take the chance any high quality floor paint will do the job just make sure you mention the environmental factors to the sales rep and you will be fine it will take about a week but i suggest you put on more than one coat hope that helps hey bill this article has been great i m painting old oak floors and i have tried to do everything by the book sanding from 150 to 250 two coats of sw paint and primer not by the book 24 to 72 hours dry time sand between coats vacuum and removed all dust then 3 coat oil fast dry poly for floors same dry time 24-72 and 250 sand paper the finish is pretty but the satin dried like a matt after a day or so and the semi gloss dried like a satin talked to two paint stores and they thought it might be moisture in the paint or air that with the quick dry oil floor poly dries too fast to let the moisture evaporate kinda frustrated with the finish i ve tried new poly and a dehumidifier one room the paint dried for 6 month in the winter still same result with the poly sitch any thoughts hi karen thanks for your kind words hmm that is strange i think it might have to do with the quality of the product what brand are you using i know that those things do affect it slightly but not to the degree you are talking about hence my question let me know hi bill great great article i want to paint my 100year old fir floors and am looking to use behr porch and patio paint which is an acrylic/latex i believe you said not to use acrylic but can i use this acrylic/latex will that work sand first to rough up polyurethane finish that i put on over 10 years ago i will primer with zinns and then 2 coats of paint what do you think thanks sharon hi sharon that should work nicely go for it let me know how it works out would love to see it hello bill when we had our house built we had unfinished pine flooring placed in a bedroom to be used by our grandchildren i painted the floor with a whitewashed finish but my husband really just wants a regular painted floor we purchased sw porch and patio latex due to wear and tear from the children your article was well written and very informative do i need to sand the floor before painting and finish with polyurethane or what thank you judy hi judy thanks for your kind words and apologies for the late response yes but you don t need to go down to bare wood hope that helps let me know how it goes please love to hear about work being done by this community this article is great i followed these steps and have painted my stairs today a dark black oil-based enamel i ve only done one coat so far and i love the way i can still make out the wood grain a little is it alright to do just one coat or will it scratch much easier it isn t necessary to put anything over it right- like wax or polyurethane again thank you for the great article hi kristin i usually suggest two coats but if your product is very high quality you might get away with just the one refinishing is what will really protect them but instead of listing all the reasons check out my article on refinishing wood floors under the hardwood category hope it helps you thanks for your comment and kind words hi bill thanks for the tips i read somewhere you need to wait 2 weeks before moving furniture back onto the floor after painting is this really necessary i want to paint my floors with oil based paint but i m not sure i can spare them for that long thanks hi amanda two weeks does sound a little excessive but i suppose it will depend on things like humidity and how long it takes to dry if your floors are bone dry i see no reason to wait two weeks just because someone says that you should i do recommend that you place your furniture carefully though don t want to scratch anything hi bill thanks for your informative article i have a question for you is it feasible to lay and screw down plywood planks fill in the gaps and counter sunk screw holes with wood filler sand those down flush and then white wash or paint the plywood flooring will the plywood accept the paint or will it be absorbed also after white washing or painting can you apply a varnish to the floor hi karen it might be a little soft for flooring but yes with a good sand primer paint and finish it will look good and work however my recommendation is that you go with a harder wood great article thanks question our house was built in 1878 original wood floors in some rooms we had these buffed and coated a couple years ago light sanding polyurethane and within 6 months some of the polyurethane coating began to bubble and if you scratch it lightly with a fingernail it will flake off if we wanted to paint the floors do you think the paint would stick if we just lightly sanded cleaned and applied a primer first or do you think it d be likely to flake given that the under layer of polyurethane is flaky thanks for your input hi laura goodness that shouldn t have happened if you are set on painting them then you will need to sand them as you mentioned however if you don t go down to the wood you don t need a primer but definitely got all that lifting finish off the floor otherwise it will ruin the paint job hope that helps hey bill thanks for the article and tips i just moved into an old rental house with my girlfriend and she wants our bedroom floors painted they are in descent shape but does need some prepping with sanding when i sand my floors can i use an electrical drum floor sander with 150grit to start off are there even 150 grit sand papers made for the drum floor sanders all the ones i ve seen online to rent have all said that they are made for 20 to 80 grits thanks hi keifer yes there are but they can often be rather difficult to find either way if you sand to the bare wood just remember that you will need to prime the floor please don t forget hehe hope that helps hi bill we have an 1970 s random with oak floor with v-grooves in the dining room it was painted at some point and the previous owner had it sanded but the white paint remains in the v-groove but not in a good way chipped uneven etc how do i remove that old paint tried scraping buy the paint is very tough to get off any suggestions would be appreciated thanks hi nan unless you want to keep those v-grooves you could always just rent a floor sander for a day to get the floor down to bare wood or hire someone to help you then it will be a fairly painless process of applying a primer refinishing and bam you will have floors that will look fantastic better than before given their age hope that helps hello i wanted to thank you for your very helpful article with your help i have just finished painting the wood floors in my smallish nyc bedroom the floors had previously been very poorly painted brown and earlier black both of these jobs were done very very poorly and had not been polyurethaned after so there was a ton of damage to the paint and the floor underneath the floor is original to the building so late 19th early 20th century i had to patch extensively because there were huge gaps between most of the boards large holes under and around the radiator and there were a ton of gouges down to the bare wood once the patching was finished took several coats in some areas i sanded again and finally put down two coats of a white latex floor paint came with a primer after letting that dry for at least 24 i did three coats of a latex polyurethane with a satin gloss unfortunately i didn t get the floors as completely level because i was doing it all by hand so there are some yellowy patches there is only one tiny area i will go back and try to sand away the other areas are in the corners it was a lot of work but it is truly amazing how much better it looks and how much calmer and happier my room makes me now so if you ve been thinking about it i recommend pulling the trigger and going for it especially if your floors are already pretty crappy and you aren t in a position to replace them next project is to paint the radiator now that it s summer and maybe paint one of the walls thanks again hi katey thanks for the kind words and for the great detail you put into your comment i appreciate it and i am sure that the community will as well i am also very happy that it looks better and that i could help you even if it was in a small way have a good one and enjoy your room i want to make sure that i get the right floors for my dining room the regular colors of wood don t match the theme i m going for i didn t know that certain hardwood floors could be painted it would be great to paint them and have it coated that way it would last long hi branden yep paint is a great way to match the floor to your decor without the wood itself doing too much in terms of color hope it all works out i would appreciate your thoughts on my situation i have a small house that was badly damaged when hurricane hermine hit our area a river location but close to the gulf the house is old and sits close to the ground i ve had plywood put on the floors planning to install vinyl or some type of flooring but in consideration of cost i m thinking of painting the plywood and using that until my bank account recovers raising the house is not feasible because of its age and our flood zone requires 17 ft height don t want to sell it either have you had experience with painted plywood hi alice i have some experience and i don t recommend it i know that you are in a bit of a predicament but yeah don t do it have you tried some wholesale retailers for hardwood planks you can sometimes pick up some really affordable stuff i can send you some information if you like just let me know have a good one hey bill so sorry for the extremely late response to your april 18th reply the poly brand i used was minwax super fast drying oil to refresh your memory i had the painted floors that the satin poly went matt and the semi gloss went satin everyone i talk to in ohio said it might be due to moisture being trapped in the finish i left ohio 1st of may double duty between nashville and ohio and heading back next week to put final coat on floors with everything that has happened to the finish i m actually thinking about using a gloss finish hoping it might turn out semi any thoughts thanks karen this article was fantastic thank you for taking the time to educate us i am doing a 12 wide plank plywood floor if i do as the article suggests and prime with an oil based primer prob original kilz and then paint with an oil based wood paint would i need to put a poly coat over it or will the oil based paint be tough enough the final color will be very very light almost white also not much traffic it s me two dogs weighing 10 and 15 pounds each and a cat her weight is tbd thank you hi delta thanks for your kind words i still recommend that you apply a poly will ensure that it lasts longer and looks better just make sure you choose a sheen that suits you eye otherwise yes everything you have said is correct in terms of matching the type of primer with the type of paint have a good one bill thanks for the great article the people at home depot recommended that i use a latex-based deck paint for my wooden kitchen floors which they claimed will be more durable than oil-based paint they also said i could use an oil-based primer first and then apply the latex deck paint does that sound right to you hi chris no that doesn t sound right although i could be wrong so many products that cover both aspects nowadays i suggest getting a second opinion let me know what you find out i am curious can bamboo floors be painted i have some on an enclosed patio that need to be updated it will have some wet traffic from the pool do you think the paint will stand up to wet traffic hi christina yes it can you will just need to ask your local retailer for outdoor floor paint that is very durable let me know how it goes our hardwood floors have started to look older because i am not good at keeping them clean and i am wondering what my options are to help them last longer it is good to know that painting wood floors can help you to revive old and worn floors i like what was said about how visible scratches scuffs or color loss are great reasons to paint the flooring to bring it back to life http //www.timbertopfloorscairns.com.au/services hello one of the best explanations out there thanks i have a question i want to paint 3 bedrooms and hallway floors the house is 1900 but i believe the floors are only 20 years old or so good condition they are yellow pine 6 boards and in good condition they most likely have a typical polyurethane finish my question is do i have to remove the finish with a serious belt sander or just rough it up hi beverly thanks for your kind words yes you will need to rough it up but not completely remove the previous layer if you do get to bare wood either by mistake or whatever you will need to use a primer on that area hope that helps hi bill thank you for all the detailed information like others i am in a dilemma w/my floors budget is tight i would love to refinish to original hardwood floor but the floors are so badly stained i m guessing from animals i am at a point where i need a quick fix in a previous comment you mentioned that refinishing and painting might be same cost i was hoping that painting would be cheaper and faster i hate to cut corners but if i choose to use a patterned tool brush to paint would i need to try to remove the dark stains as much as possible or do you think that they will be too evident even with a pattern on top thank you for your time and advice hi monica either way you will have to sand the floors a little otherwise the paint will not stick honestly the effort and money involved in painting is not much cheaper than getting it refinished it is completely up to you but maybe weigh up the costs as for that stain paint should hide it and you can apply another layer of paint once its dried for the pattern hi thank you for this easy-to-read and very informative article i can t begin to tell you how many articles i ve read about painting worn out hardwood floors but yours is definitely the first one that made complete sense to me thank you for that i d like to know if you can recommend a water-based floor paint for me we live in very humid north carolina and painted our dining room floor about 2 years ago with an oil-based paint it took about 3 weeks to get cured enough to put furniture back in this is with about 1 to 1-1/2 weeks of leaving the windows open and running fans i would prefer to not deal with that again any recommendations for a simpler way thanks so much hi suzanne it is a pleasure glad you like it yeah that is the issue with oil sure its hardy but damn it is difficult to live with for awhile lol latex based floor paint will be fine just get a very high quality one and apply 2-3 coats it is much better honestly hi bill i just painted my floor inside a commercial space the floor is a laminate wood floor we sanded first and then used two coats of a floor paint for the base then added a design on top using a sign painters painting enamel what would you suggest we use to seal the paint i ve heard of osmo poly-x and also masterclear supreme clearcoat in matte finish but not sure if either is right for the job appreciate any help you can provide hi ryan besides recommending specific products not everything is available globally i recommend that you simply look for a floor based finish decide on the sheen its shininess basically and buy one that is on the mid to high price range that will ensure that its a quality product generally speaking and it will come out perfectly hope that helps hi bill great article i have old pine boards 12 that have been treated in beeswax for year i am thinking of painting them white now can i paint directly over them or do i need to re sand many thanks for any advice joe hi joe thanks for the kind words you will need to sand that previous finish off apply a primer and then paint a little more work perhaps but it will ensure that it comes out right hope that helps i read a bunch of posts on this topic and yours is by the far the most comprehensive and informative i had linoleum in my kitchen which my contractor ripped up then inserted wood planks to form a continuous floor extending from my living room where i already had wood flooring into the adjacent kitchen he then sanded the old floors did i m not sure what to the new planks then stained the floors the same dark color throughout a year later the floors still look great except for the area in the kitchen where the color is badly fading even though the area doesn t get much traffic why would the new planks have not held on to the stain in any event i was thinking of painting the area of the floor in the kitchen and leaving the rest as is i assume i have to sand there is no getting around that it s a very small kitchen but should i rent a sander if i do have to stain thanks ﻿ hi ezra it is possible that the existing stained floor had a couple coats very common it is as easy as applying another coat to the new planks and if the current stain is intact you shouldn t need to sand maybe just a little little bit with some super fine sandpaper but nothing else hope that helps hi bill i bought a portable building that i am making into a house the floor is treated plywood i want to keep it instead of putting in new flooring i have used wood putty to fill any inconsistencies i will be sanding it to a smooth finish is it okay to sand prime paint and then polyurethane i m trying to do this on a budget and don t want to mess anything up and have to start over again i m also limited in my physical ability so doing it twice has no appeal to me lol thank you for any advice you can give me i m so glad i found your site very helpful hi allison yeah that will be fine go for it let me know how it works out for you and thanks for the kind words hi allison i m getting ready to turn a 40 shipping container into a tiny home and have been researching what to do with the floors your comment caught my eye because i was considering filling all of the scratches and gashes with wood putty and then painting like you i was hoping you could let me know how it worked out for you and if you are happy with it pictures would be awesome hi robin i have emailed allison on your behalf as i am also interested in seeing some photos let s hope she responds thanks for your comment hi bill i painted a kitchen floor white with porch flooring latex paint recommended by a hardware store i painted 3 coats and the knots of the wood are coming through since then i painted another floor using an oil based enamel and love the hardness of it can i repaint my kitchen floor using the oil based enamel thank you in advance for your expert advice kind regards kelly hi kelly oil is great but i am surprised that the latex didn t hold up before you commit to the oil not that it is a bad thing maybe investigate if the latex product you used was a decent quality maybe the hardware store misinformed you hope that helps hello there so grateful for your article i recently painted my kitchen and living room floors with behr porch and floor paint the coverage is great and i like the color my biggest challenge is the way dirt seems to be trapped on the floor immediately the second you walk on it the color is a light gray and i understand if i went to a beige then it probably wouldn t show the dirt as well but i don t have an option to repaint the color i am wondering if i can talk this with a polyurethane water-based coat i am hoping that that would keep it from attracting so much dirt do you have any suggestions i am assuming that to put the polyurethane on there i would need to do a fine grit sanding thanks so much for your help hi kendal if you dont have a finish at the moment yes that will definitely help just choose a sheen that isn t too shiny yes that is correct let me know how it goes hi bill thanks so much for the great article my question is i guess i m a little confused we want to paint our kitchen hardwood floors .heavy traffic area is oil-based or latex recommended for heavier traffic thanks in advance hi maggie floor paints have come a long way if you get a latex based paint provided it is specifically a floor paint it will be just as strong as oil plus much less fumes hope that helps hi bill ..love this article and all of the comments and your responses i don t believe i ever read what kind of primer to use .will kilz or bins for walls be acceptable hi judy thanks for your kind words i havn t used that not saying it is a bad product though just choose a quality product that is specifically used for hard woods hope that helps hi bill what wood would you recommend to use on top of a cement floor we have been struggling with our cement floors that has been painted so i want to change the look but putting wood on top of the cement hi carmen you can use any hardwood or even laminate it is really up to you just make sure that the company that you use is trustworthy and installs a decent underlayment bill such great replies a feedback thanks for your diligence my dilemma is that during sanding the previous painted areas if my floor gum up i suspect this is from the heat generated from sanding but has been unavoidable thus far will this show through my final finish any suggestions to avoiding this headache altogether thanks fir your input hi todd it is a pleasure are you using a decent orbital sander if you have the correct equipment it should blast through the paint without any issue hope i understood your question correctly please let me know hi bill thanks for your fantastic article i m in england and am renovating a victorian terrace i pulled up the scary old carpets to reveal pretty good and clean pine floorboards there is a vague darker boarder in each room where the the floors would have once upon a time have been lacquered around the carpet i ve decided to go ahead with the first bedroom and paint the floor white i washed the floors well with sugar soap and then primed with albany solvent borne wood primer and then painted two coats of white coo-var floor paint must be oil based as it require thinners to wash brushes the finished result seems to have a green tinge which isn t so attractive and now i m worrying that it s the start of yellowing effect that often happens with oil based white paint already coming through after a few days what do you think or could it be the paint that s a strange colour when it dries if so can you recommend a good white white also i was naughty and didn t sand the floors will it all be peeling off in a few months time ek hi bowen yeah you definitely should have sanded lol but don t despair it doesn t necessarily doom the floors just hope that it all stays down hehe that tinge is strange my suggestion is to apply another coat of the paint as long as it is a good quality brand don t choose the cheapest this third coat should do it re the one that you are using i don t have any experience with that brand but ask at your local shops they can advise you based on what is available in your area i ve had a little experience with white oil based paint sadly it did yellow maybe that s the issue you re seeing with your floors i got tired of it and just painted over it with latex white yes i know that s not the go to method and all logic says it s wrong but it worked for me as to specific brands i m in the us so couldn t recommend an english brand to use however i d go back to the store you got your paint from tell them the discoloration issue and see what they say hi anna appreciate you helping out bowen i am sure that he will appreciate your advice hi bill love love love your blog i am getting ready to repaint my kitchen floor which gets heavy traffic yup dogs too pine floors dating back to 1840 that were oil based painted over thirty years ago with some spots showing original stained floor boards i need to fill in one area with putty termites long gone but one board still presents slight damage i dont think i need to prime but i plan to smooth over the entire floor with sander to even out where paint has worn off and was going to use some oil based paint i have hoarded for years as the base and then spatter/splatter paint over it questions 1. must i use the exact same oil paint in different color for the spatters 2. what do i seal all of this work with my husband feels mcclusky used on basketball courts would be ideal but i wanted to get your thoughts too will send photos after if you like but i do want this to last for another 30 years so need your best advice thanks hi judith thanks for your kind words you don t have to use the same brand of oil paint but it should be of the same quality you can use any floor based sealer as long as it s for oil based paint this is very important i havn t personally used mcclusky but i feel it might be a little glossy for your home up to you thanks again bill you are right i don t want a glossy finish so will use best high quality polyurethane in oil yes oil as the paint is oil i can find you rock great article bill i have tried to paint the floors in my bedroom with a floor paint as the previous tenants painted the floors with a dark cranberry colour i m painting them white for a cottage feel i put on 2 coats letting them dry for at least 49 hours between coats however only a couple of months later the floors are flaking and the paint is coming off revealing the old colour again.the previous paint was non-washable which made keeping the floors clean nearly impossible the floors are wide plank pine by the way your article says a primer shouldn t be necessary on previously painted floors what did i do wrong hi jo-anne the primer is not necessary unless bare wood is exposed i think the issue is the sanding done prior to your paint job did you do that part properly hi bill excellent article and continuing responses obviously helpful as the thread continues into late 2017 i ve gathered a lot of good info here so thought i d contribute by sharing a couple of things i ve learned over the years rehabbing a few old places if pets were part of the home then dark stains on wood floors are commonly from the ammonia in urine ammonia is used as a staining agent in woodworking and it can stain the wood a permanent black it can go pretty deep if left long enough which can be for many reasons such as hidden by carpet or other mostly permanent furniture or otherwise re-offending pets etc you can try sanding the area minimally then cleaning with oxalic acid or wood bleach i have known some who have left a cloth soaked with wood bleach on the area for a few hours and it worked well enough to soften the color enough to make it mostly disappear after stain and seal but i don t recommend heavy handed use unless you ve got some experience just be judicious with the strength of the wood bleach and how long you leave it to work if i don t get decent results after two applications i move on to the next strategy which is oftentimes the only remedy is to replace the individual floor boards that are blackened and although best done by a professional it is easy enough to do once you are aware of how it s done and the caveats of doing a good job with your particular floor which is why a professional is a good choice they ve seen and done enough different floor jobs to do the right job for a particular specific floor another thought i d pass along is that when i was 16 or 17 working on a carpentry crew we had a job refinishing the painted floors of an 1870 farmhouse the high white paint was sanded down but then the old timer on our crew came in with a tool that had a small t shape on one end of an 8 or 9 inch piece of steel he spent the day pushing the paint that was in the crevices between the boards down into the void underneath or compressing it back at least and of course some of it came out altogether after he stained and sealed the floor there was no paint to be seen anywhere in any crevice or junction between the walls and floor boards pretty amazing to me as i was convinced there was no way that much white paint on that much floor was not going to show up in a natural stain wood floor one way or another thanks for your good work hopefully these are helpful comments kwl hi kwl goodness what a fantastic contribution to the comment section of this article you have my sincere appreciation great tips and i am 100 certain that they will help the community thanks again excellent article we took up carpeting in our master bedroom hoped the oak hardwood floor would be ok as is but it wasn t. hubby said didn t you always want a white painted floor so off to the store for latex primer porch and floor paint we went we love the result it s holding up well and will be 3 years next month a few dings that s gon na happen with any floor a few dog s nail scratches if you look just right at certain times of the day but overall it s holding up exceptionally well we followed all the right steps now we re planning to remove carpeting from our lr and install higher grade plywood floors that too will be painted excited to see them and i m saving your article…just in case we need the step-by-step help hi anna thanks for your kind words and for sharing your experience it warms my heart to hear things like this appreciate the comment hey bill so glad to have found your article i m getting ready to paint my hardwood floors and solidifying my plan of action i want a light color with a low sheen for a cottage look i am planning to rent an orbital sander to rough up the finish and then apply 2 coats of latex floor paint i have small kids so i need something without all the fumes i ve been reading reviews of various brands of floor paint and i m having trouble finding one that gets good reviews do you have a particular brand that you recomend i have a big fear of the paint scratching off easily once i m done and also a fear of it staying tacky for weeks thanks again for posting such a great article hi drew i recommend that you go to our local hardware store and ask for a premium grade latex floor paint and buy something that is obviously better quality than the rest if you sand to the bare wood don t forget to add a primer good luck and thanks for the kind words your email address will not be published
