establish in our lives it answers whether we are alone or not as a human race and whether or not our existence has purpose can we logically prove the existence of god without going to the bible if by god we mean a creator of the universe then the answer is certainly yes specifically identifying this creator as the god of the bible however does require proving and accepting the bible to be true—a topic for another time by considering certain aspects of the natural world around us we can arrive at the commonsense conclusion that there is a powerful all-wise creator who made it all let s explore five key proofs of god s existence with clear illustrations to back them up to make it easier to remember we ll use the acronym godly the molecular information of genes instructs cells in how to function and reproduce the study of genetics has revolutionized our understanding of living things and how they operate key illustration dna containing the 3-billion-letter code inside our cells of four recurring letters or chemicals actually the names of which start with these letters it s a virtual library of instruction manuals for assembling and operating all the cells of the body a few years ago one of the world s most famous atheists professor anthony flew came to the conclusion that god exists based on dna evidence what i think the dna material has done he wrote is that it has shown by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce life that intelligence must have been involved in getting these extraordinarily diverse elements to work together it s the enormous complexity of the number of elements and the enormous subtlety of the ways they work together the meeting of these two parts at the right time by chance is simply minute it is all a matter of the enormous complexity by which the results were achieved which looked to me like the work of intelligence there is a god 2007 p. 75 in his book the case for a creator former atheist lee strobel writes the six-feet of dna coiled inside every one of our body s one-hundred trillion cells contains a four-letter chemical alphabet that spells out precise assembly instructions for all the proteins from which our bodies are made cambridge-educated stephen meyer demonstrated that no hypothesis has come close to explaining how information got into biological matter by naturalistic evolutionary means 2004 p. 282 so there is no logical explanation as to how this incredibly extensive exquisite code inside the cell could exist without a supremely intelligent being having designed it microsoft founder bill gates noted dna is like a software program only much more complex than anything we ve ever devised the road ahead 1996 p. 228 it is absurd to think that nobody designed such a complex code—that it is simply a result of time chance and mutation if things have an origin they first needed an originator the greatest question in philosophy is why does something exist instead of nothing philosophers don t really have an adequate answer but there is a principle in nature that points to the answer—everything with a beginning has a cause and there are no known exceptions to this rule key illustration the universe physics and astronomy have established that the universe had a beginning for instance it can be shown that the universe is presently expanding outward from an initial point so if everything with a beginning has a cause and if the universe has a beginning then it must also have a cause that created it—the first cause moreover everything that is caused to exist is brought about by something superior to itself therefore something greater than the universe must have brought it into existence this is a strong proof that a creator exists everything that has a specific and complex design has a designer for instance a building is designed by an architect no amount of time chance and unthinking natural processes can produce a building in a similar way we see the exquisite designs of things around us on mt rushmore in the black hills of south dakota we see the complex and specific design of the faces of four american presidents carved into the rock wind and erosion can produce predictable designs on some mountains but not obvious well-known human faces history tells us that gutzon borglum carved the faces on mt rushmore but even if there were no record of these being sculpted we would still know that someone designed them and made them likewise the natural realm itself shows evidence of design key illustration the earth the fact that so many of the planet s features had to be just right for complex life to exist indicates that a designer was at work the combination and interworking of such features are far too complex for them to be the product of mere chance for instance for the earth to have life it had to be just the right size—8,000 miles in diameter if it were 9,500 miles in diameter scientists have concluded it would double the weight of the air then there would be so much oxygen turning into water that it would cover the entire earth none of the continents would have appeared so there would be no land-based life—including us the earth is just the right distance from the sun—93 million miles if it were just 5 percent farther out from the sun the earth would be too cold and mostly covered with ice but if it were just a bit closer to the sun it would be unbearably hot and the polar ice caps would melt flooding the coasts the earth also needs the right rotational speed if it were just a little faster the earth would not be warmed enough freezing much of the surface but if it were slower the heat would be oppressive it also needs just the right atmosphere—78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen the precise amounts to sustain complex life the earth also has the correct tilt—23.5 degrees—allowing us to have the four seasons and twice as much arable soil as a different tilt angle would provide even the moon is precisely the right size and distance from the earth for the tides to move the oceans around keeping them clean and aerated to find more examples read the 2004 book the privileged planet by guillermo gonzalez and jay richards where did the laws of the universe come from they re not matter or energy but they govern how both operate there is no intrinsic reason for the laws of nature to exist in fact these laws had to be created and in place when matter and energy appeared or there would be total chaos the laws of the universe require that a lawgiver calibrated them and set them into effect key illustration gravity without this force that causes mass to attract other objects life could not exist and the intensity of all the forces must be in precise ratios to one another the famous physicist stephen hawking stated the universe and the laws of physics seem to have been specifically designed for us if any of about 40 physical qualities had more than slightly different values life as we know it could not exist either atoms would not be stable or they wouldn t combine into molecules or the stars wouldn t form the heavier elements or the universe would collapse before life could develop and so on austin american-statesman october 19 1997 who caused mass to affect its surroundings as it does to the degree that it does who made the other laws that must have been exquisitely designed and calibrated to work in total harmony the logical answer it must be an utterly supreme and all-powerful intelligence what does believing in god yield answer positive results especially in the long run an article titled take ten commandments and call me in the morning states using both anecdotal and research data dr. harold koenig demonstrates that there is ample evidence to show that people who regularly attend church pray read and put into practice what the bible or their faith teaches are overall healthier just for starters they have significantly lower blood pressure are hospitalized less recover from surgery faster have stronger immune systems and are likely to live longer emotional health also benefits family life is better and depression is lower in those with faith christianity today nov. 11 1999 key illustration answered prayer if there were no god then prayers for supernatural intervention would never be answered yet there are so many examples of answered prayer all around us—of miraculous interventions that defy physical explanation there are simply vast numbers of witnesses of this phenomenon including this author this should strengthen our faith in the fact that god exists and that he cares about what happens to us thus proving that god exists is not a matter of blind faith—but of well-reasoned faith justified by hard evidence for the evidence that there is a god is overwhelming remember these five key godly concepts and accompanying five illustrations to prove god s existence even without the use of the bible mr. seiglie was born in havana cuba and came to the united states when he was a child he found out about the church when he was 17 from a church member in
