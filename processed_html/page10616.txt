Cruise from Helsinki to Stockholm - Helsinki Message Board - TripAdvisor My wife and I are planning to  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-64363962', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); cruise  from  Helsinki  to  Stockholm  on 25 May. I found that there are 2 main  cruise  lines providing this service - Viking and Tallink Silja. I found that the pricing is similar, and I would appreciate if someone could give your opinion on which of this  cruise  line is your preferred  cruise  line and why. I also found that there are third party website like  ' direct ferries '  that I can book  cruise  from, and the price is exactly the same as booking from the  cruise  lines themselves. Would anyone know of any benefits to booking through such third party website as compared to booking with the  cruise  lines themselves. Can someone comment and compare cruising in the night instead of the day and vice versa for the Helsinki - Stockholm route. We have never been on a  cruise  before. Thanks Is it true that that a return  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-64364325', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); cruise  ticket is cheaper than a one way ticket. If that is the case, can I purchase a a return ticket ( Helsinki  -  Stockholm  - Helsinki), and get off at Stockholm and not use the return portion. Can anyone advice. I cannot see any benefits in booking through an intermediary if the price is the same. In such a case you lose the direct contact with the ferry company if things go wrong (cancellations etc. have to be then done through the intermediary with their cancellation terms and conditions which may be more strict than those of the ferry company).  For differences between TallinkSilja and Viking Line there are plenty of earlier threads on this forum, just use the search function above OR have a look on the Top Questions about  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-64364520', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Helsinki  box in the top right corner of the web version of the forum page. There ' s a link to a thread titled  " Which ferry to  Sweden " . :) Sometimes (or should I say often) a  cruise  package can be cheaper than a oneway route ticket. You can leave the return part unsused. They don ' t control whether you return to the ship or not. The ships stay in the port (between Helsinki and  Stockholm ) the whole day (except in summer Viking Line ' s ships pop in  Tallinn  and return to Helsinki during the day). I ' d say it ' s a good idea to sleep the night on board the  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-64776542', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); cruise  ship, this way you don ' t have to spend money on a hotel. If you want to explore  Stockholm  more than one day you could check if the cruising company offers good deals on hotel rooms booked via their website.  There are at least two major harbours for passenger ships in  Helsinki  and Stockholm. They all have relatively good public transport connections, but you might want to check the harbour locations on a map and see which is more convenient for your planned activities in Stockholm and your accomodation in Helsinki.  In Helsinki Viking cruise ships depart from the  Katajanokka  harbour, search street address  " Katajanokanlaituri 8 "  in Google maps. Tallink Silja ships depart from the Olympic terminal, the address is Olympiaranta 1. These harbours in Helsinki are accessible by tram and they are not too far from the city center to walk, if you don ' t have much heavy luggage.  In Stockholm Viking ships arrive to Stadsgården, Tegelvikshamn. Tallink Silja ships arrive to Värtan, the street address is Södra Hamnvägen 46. These two harbours are located in different parts of Stockholm. If you can ' t find any other reason for choosing one shipping company over another, see which harbour suits you better.

That was a little while ago and what I remember is a lot of drunk passengers. I wouldn ' t mention it now, except that as I am looking online for Baltic  cruises  for my family, I saw a post on this website from 2008 which also said that the overnight  cruises  attract partiers. There ' s a lot less partying now between HEL-STO as there ' s a specific party boat between HEL-TAL and also the much cheaper booze prices in  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-64802075', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Tallinn  attract parties to that direction.  Midweek surely is no party boat, more like granny boat. > Can someone comment and compare cruising in the night instead of the day and vice versa for the  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-64804818', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Helsinki  -  Stockholm  route. We have never been on a  cruise  before. < There is no daytime ferry service between Helsinki and Stockholm. Both ferry companies run only overnight services. However, in late May the hours of daylight even in the south of  Finland  are so long that the difference between night and day is not entirely clear. You will get to see more than enough islands in clear daylight, that ' s for sure. This alone is something hugely exotic for visitors from tropical climes like yourself. Re the  ' granny boat '  polarbearfin refers to, many of my foreign visitors have enjoyed seeing the geriatric dancing on Baltic ferries. It ' s a cultural attraction, an exotic folk custom for many nationalities. As far as drunkenness goes, you can always avoid most of it by going to bed early. By the time you wake up, the worst offenders will be locked up in the brig and you can enjoy the sunlit islands in peace. I ' ve made hundreds of crossings on the Baltic and I ' ve had only one encounter with a nasty drunk in the past 20 years by taking this precaution, and even that occasion was only a small problem. -:- Message from TripAdvisor staff -:- This topic has been closed to new posts due to inactivity.
