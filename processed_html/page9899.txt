Astigmatism in Chesterfield | Treating Astigmatism in Chesterfield | Vision Correction in Chesterfield Astigmatism is a  common eye condition that's easily corrected by     eyeglasses, contact lenses, or  surgery. Astigmatism is  characterized     by an irregular curvature of the cornea. This is one type of    refractive   error. Astigmatism occurs in nearly everybody to some   degree. For    significant curvature, treatment is required. A person's eye is  naturally spherical in shape. Under normal     circumstances, when light enters the  eye, it refracts evenly, creating a     clear view of the object. However, the eye  of a person with     astigmatism is shaped more like a football or the back of a  spoon. For     this person, when light enters the eye it is refracted more in one      direction than the other, allowing only part of the object to be in     focus at  one time. Objects at any distance can appear blurry and wavy. What Causes Astigmatism? Astigmatism can be  hereditary and is often present at birth.   It can   also result from pressure from  the eyelids on the cornea,   incorrect   posture, or an increased use of the eyes  for close work. What Are the Symptoms of Astigmatism? People with  undetected astigmatism often experience headaches,     fatigue, eyestrain, and  blurred vision at all distances. While these     symptoms may not necessarily be  the result of astigmatism, you should     schedule an eye exam if you are  experiencing one or more symptoms. How Are Astigmatisms Diagnosed? Your optometrist  or ophthalmologist can diagnose astigmatism   with a   thorough eye exam.  Astigmatism may occur with other refractive   errors   such as myopia ( nearsightedness)  and hyperopia (   farsightedness).    Unfortunately, astigmatism often goes undetected in   school-age   children.  Because  astigmatisms may increase slowly, you should visit your     optometrist or  ophthalmologist whenever you notice significant changes     in your vision.  Optometrists are trained specifically to examine the     general health of the eyes  and prescribeÂ  eyeglasses and contact     lenses.  Ophthalmologists provide total eye care, including exams,     diagnosis, and  treatment of disease through medication and surgery. How Are Astigmatisms Treated? Almost all degrees  of astigmatism can be corrected with   properly   prescribed eyeglasses or contact  lenses. For a person with   only a   slight degree of astigmatism, corrective  lenses may not be   needed at   all, as long as other conditions such as  nearsightedness or     farsightedness are not present. If the astigmatism is  moderate to high,     however, corrective lenses are probably needed. Refractive  surgeries require healthy eyes that are free from     retinal problems, corneal  scars, and any eye disease. As technology     progresses, it is becoming more and  more important that you explore all     options and possibilities before deciding  which refractive surgery   and   treatment is right for you. 224 South Woods Mill Road, Suite 700 South                                 Chesterfield, Missouri 63017                                                                         Phone: 314-219-1902   Fax: 314-469-6709                                 Glaucoma Consultants of St. Louis,  All Rights Reserved |  Ophthalmology Website Design     Astigmatism in Chesterfield | Treating Astigmatism in Chesterfield | Vision Correction in Chesterfield
