Box Office: 'Fantastic Beasts 2' Misses $100M With $12M Friday, 'Grinch' Earns $11.6M I've studied the film industry, both academically and informally, and with an emphasis in box office analysis, for nearly 30 years. I have extensively written about all of said subjects for the last 11 years. My outlets for film criticism, box office commentary, and film-skewing scholarship have included The Huffington Post, Salon, and Film Threat.

'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' In holdover news for Friday, Warner Bros.’  Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald  earned another $11.82 million (-53%) on its second Friday, bringing its eight-day domestic cume to $99.287m. So, yeah, it’ll be passing $100m domestic by the end of this sentence. That Friday drop is better than  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part I  (-66%) but steeper than  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  (-43%) or  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them  (-38%). The $200m-budgeted David Yates-directed fantasy should earn $29m (-53%) over the Fri-Sun frame and $42m over the holiday for a $116.2m ten-day domestic total. That it’s playing closer to  Justice League  than  Fantastic Beasts  in terms of domestic legs is not good, but if it holds the line overseas (it should be over $350m today) then this may be trivia until  Fantastic Beasts 3  opens. Illumination and Universal/Comcast Corp.’s  The Grinch  earned another solid $11.6 million (+30% from last Friday) for a new cume of $162m domestic. The $75m-budgeted Dr. Seuss adaptation should pull $29.225m (-24%) for its third weekend and $41m over the holiday frame for a $179.5m 17-day total. Barring a fluke, this is still looking like a $250m+ domestic grosser, and it’s certainly passing the (unadjusted) $213m domestic total of  The Lorax  from back in 2012.  Bohemian Rhapsody  earned another $5.22m (+21% from last Friday) for a new $143.3m domestic cume. We can expect the Freddie Mercury biopic to pull in $13m (-19%) over the Fri-Sun frame and $18.5m over the holiday for a $151.1m domestic cume. Yeah, with $400m+ worldwide on a $55m budget, this is a monster hit for 20th Century Fox and friends. Paramount/Viacom Inc.'s  Instant Family earned $4.6 million (+2%) on its second Friday to set the stage for a $11.775m (-19%) second-weekend gross and a $16.7m holiday haul for a promising $35m ten-day cume. The Mark Wahlberg/Rose Byrne foster family dramedy balances unapologetic black comedy with grounded melodrama for an uncommonly satisfying mainstream studio experience. I sincerely hope it finds an audience over the next month. Ditto for Steven McQueen and Gillian Flynn’s Widows , which blends pulp with prestige for a top-notch crime drama that happens to have a lot on its mind. The film earned $3m (-27%) on Friday for a possible $8m (-36%) second weekend and $10.6m holiday haul. That’ll be a $25.6m ten-day cume, so it still needs post-holiday legs, awards-season love or an overseas miracle. Vote with your wallet!
