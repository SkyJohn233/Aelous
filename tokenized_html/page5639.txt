mayfair theater in ventura is now hanging in the seabee museum at naval base ventura county port hueneme it symbolizes life on the home front during world war ii photo contributed photo/hanako wakatsuki-chong after years of arduous renovation the shiny neon-lit marquee that is now installed at the seabee museum at naval base ventura county port hueneme bears little resemblance to the battered heap of metal it was three years ago thanks to the efforts of navy seabee veterans of america island x-7 who coordinated the renovation and fundraising for the project the marquee that once topped ventura s mayfair theater beckons visitors to the museum 's movie theater and an area representing the world war ii home front it looks amazing said lara godbille museum director and the benefit is twofold to get the look going in terms of the exhibit narrative and it s great piece of local history the navy has been a part of that local history for 75 years according to godbille the marquee was donated to the navy before the island x-7 group took on the project bob quinn a member of island x-7 said the group had no idea of the time money and effort it would take to get the old theater front restored i think it looks beautiful they did a super job and i m delighted we took it on but we all learned 'don t bite off more than you can chew quinn said noting that the group has decided to avoid such large undertakings in the future we re never going to take on another project this size he said we will continue to support the museum but most of us volunteer in other ways. quinn said the idea of using the mayfair marquee which topped a ventura theater that was built in 1940 was proposed because the museum wanted to have a compelling entrance that would make people feel as though they had stepped into the world war ii era when the seabees were formed in this photo from august 2013 a crane lifts the then-73-year-old mayfair theater marquee out of the dirt at figueroa street and thompson boulevard in ventura where it had sat for a decade it was the first step in getting the marquee to the u.s. seabee museum at naval base ventura county port hueneme the renovation has been completed and the marquee is now installed photo star file photo they thought taking the old marquee that was sitting in an empty lot in ventura would be easier than constructing a similar theater front from scratch while there is no way to know whether they saved money or time by refurbishing the old marquee it definitely took a lot of effort said james parker another island x-7 member it was a lot more work than expected we thought it would not be a big deal but a few months turned out to be years parker said it turned out very well we found a company that knew how to make the neon tubing that had to be reproduced. that company was dave 's signs of ventura parker said the marquee showcases an important aspect of the seabee museum letting people know about the united states naval construction forces which became active march 5 1942 the construction battalions were nicknamed the seabees a lot of people don t know about seabees and the museum exists so the community knows what the seabees are doing parker said the seabees are a military organization that frequently gets involved with humanitarian projects a road or a little school it s not just always military tactical construction there is a lot of goodwill work. seth johnson who is a past member of island x-7 said the old piece that crowned the mayfair theater had to be cut apart right away and both of the large wings were removed from the middle area the whole thing was out sitting in the dirt demolished and vandalized and about as bad as it could get johnson said when we went down there to look it over we didn t want to touch it it was quite a responsibility taking on something that s going to be acceptable to the navy. after painstakingly cleaning out decades of accumulated filth including a fair share of animal carcasses the sign had to be cut in half creating a crown and a base because it didn t fit through the museum doors quinn said among the volunteers helping with the work of rebuilding the marquee were seabees and civilian welders at the construction equipment division and the naval facilities engineering and expeditionary warfare center the metal was repaired and the entire structure was repainted in colors that were original which was determined by stripping back the paint layer by layer quinn said it took years for the island x-7 to get donations and negotiate with the navy to contract the job to dave s signs which completed the intricate neon work there were a lot of starts and stops quinn said a small ceremony is planned for 2 p.m. thursday at the museum which can be reached from the 1200 block of north ventura road in port hueneme to thank the people who were involved with the restoration project a ribbon-cutting and official opening celebration are planned for january
