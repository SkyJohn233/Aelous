discuss this weekend 's aew fyter fest and its co-creator kenny omega 's recent mean-tweets to wwe it 's the postmodern dilemma of all postmodern dilemmas do we care about who is wrestling on the aew card saturday in daytona or do we care about what kenny omega the executive vice president of aew thinks about his corporate competition 's shady international political and economic dealings why do

this week 's supershowdown also in the news tafka marlena takes a gun to the tampa airport like a dum-dum and wwe takes its first step at another type of showdown this one going head-to-head with aew in august tune in to hear all about it but that is far from all dearlisteners the boys discuss both aew double or nothing and nxt takeover xxv breaking down every match on both cards in terms of wrestling personnel relevance and prestige because that is where we are now in the new wrestling war every match matters and you may be surprised which way the pendulum swings this time around turn on tune in and drop out kiddos it 's the only wrestling podcast that calls it right down the middle it 's a look forward to double or nothing and a look back at money in the bank either way the wrestling
