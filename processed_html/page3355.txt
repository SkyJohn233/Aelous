The 82 mm Model 41 mortar was a Soviet technological marvel of the early years of WW2. Soviets managed to create a medium mortar with its weight comparable to contemporary light mortars, and the mortar allowed for so much firepower over their adversaries. Not only that, but with its caliber being slightly larger than any other medium mortar, it is able to fire all kinds of ammo available to it, including 80 mm German rounds, 81 mm NATO rounds, and all Warsaw Pact and Chicom 82 mm rounds. It was copied by Chinese as Type 53 and Type 67. All of its qualities made it the best mortar used in Vietnam War. Your comment action was successful.
