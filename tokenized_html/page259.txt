biotechnology pp 139-154 cite as anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria are a diverse collection of organisms that are defined by their ability to grow using energy from light without evolving oxygen the dominant groups are purple sulfur bacteria purple nonsulfur bacteria green sulfur bacteria and green and red filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria they represent several bacterial phyla but they all have bacteriochlorophylls and carotenoids and photochemical reaction centers which generate atp and cellular reductants used for co 2 fixation they typically have an anaerobic lifestyle in the light although some grow aerobically in the dark some of them oxidize inorganic sulfur compounds for light-dependent co 2 fixation this ability can be exploited for photobiological removal of hydrogen sulfide from wastewater and biogas the anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria also perform bioremediation of recalcitrant dyes pesticides and heavy metals under anaerobic conditions finally these organisms may be useful for overexpression of membrane proteins and photobiological production of h 2 and other valuable compounds bacteriochlorophyll standard reduction potential at ph 7 and 25 °c extracellular polymeric substances filamentous anoxygenic phototrophs green sulfur bacteria photobioreactor purple nonsulfur bacteria purple sulfur bacteria phototrophic organisms are defined by their ability to convert light energy into chemical energy in forms useful for growth and other metabolic processes 1 2 3 cyanobacteria and microalgae are the only phototrophic microorganisms that evolve o 2 as a result of this process this is because they have an enzyme complex capable of oxidizing water to oxygen h 2 o → 2h ½o 2 2e − and donating the electrons to a type ii photochemical reaction center these organisms are therefore oxygenic i.e. oxygen-evolving phototrophs phototrophs that do not oxidize water may for example oxidize hydrogen sulfide h 2 s → 2h s 2e − and donate the electrons to the photochemical reaction center in the organism these organisms are therefore anoxygenic i.e. not oxygen-evolving phototrophs in either case these electron transfer reactions generate a transmembrane proton motive force used for atp generation and other physiological purposes the reductants generated by the reaction center are also used for biosynthetic purposes and cyclic electron transfer around the reaction centers to generate even more proton motive force the vast majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria grow phototrophically only under anaerobic conditions 4 some may be capable of chemotrophic growth under aerobic conditions in the dark typical of purple bacteria but others are obligate anaerobic and are killed by o 2 typical of green sulfur bacteria gsb anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria rarely form visibly large accumulations in natural environments because of their anaerobic lifestyle but occasionally various purple bacteria may bloom and color ponds coastal areas and wastewater reservoirs red purple or reddish-brown anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria may not be as extensively used for biotechnological applications as chemotrophic microorganisms however given their diversity and the rising interest in biological solutions to societal challenges more applications should be explored for example the extensive intracellular membrane systems in purple bacteria may have practical applications sect 8 another underexplored area is the potential for production of proteins and metabolites that are o 2 sensitive in the following a survey is made of biotechnological applications of the anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria the bioremediating properties of oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria were recently reviewed 5 simplified models of the photosynthetic machinery in a purple bacteria and b green sulfur bacteria gsb during photoautotrophic growth on inorganic sulfur compounds light is harvested by the peripheral antennae lh1 lh2 or chlorosomes and the excitation energy is transferred to the reaction center rc light-driven cyclic electron transfer occurs when electrons are continuously transferred between the reaction center and the membrane-bound cytochrome bc 1 b isp in a light-dependent manner this electron transfer generates a proton motive force which fuels other physiological processes such as atp synthesis nadh is generated by reverse electron flow in purple bacteria under photoautotrophic growth conditions if suitable organic substrates are available for photoheterotrophic growth in purple bacteria nadh for cellular activities is instead obtained by oxidation of these organic substrates and the photochemical system may function exclusively in a cyclic mode to produce atp for details on oxidation of

rhodopsin-like proteins 2 3 these membrane-bound enzymes absorb light energy and as a result transfer protons across the membrane thereby conserving the light energy as a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient rhodopsins do not transfer electrons and are not associated with large light-harvesting antennae as are photochemical reactions centers rhodopsins are well-known components of halophilic archaea where they support a phototrophic lifestyle under anaerobic conditions rhodopsin-like enzymes have recently been found in numerous very different marine microbes archaea bacteria and eukaryotes but the exact contribution to cell physiology is not always clear in these organisms phototrophy based on rhodopsins is not considered further here purple bacteria belong to the phylum proteobacteria and are characterized by having type ii photochemical reaction centers and bacteriochlorophyll bchl a or bchl b as the major pigment 4 6 the light-harvesting lh antennae known as lh1 and lh2 are located in the cytoplasmic and intracytoplasmic membranes as a group the purple bacteria are very physiologically versatile and may grow photoautotrophically photoheterotrophically or chemotrophically in the dark by fermentation or by aerobic or anaerobic respiration a subgroup of the purple bacteria the purple sulfur bacteria psb is characterized by a predominant photoautotrophic lifestyle where inorganic sulfur compounds such as sulfide serve as electron donors for photosynthesis the other major subgroup of purple bacteria known collectively as purple nonsulfur bacteria pnsb is characterized by a predominantly photoheterotrophic lifestyle where many organic compounds can be assimilated and these organisms are not as tolerant to sulfide as the psb psb are gammaproteobacteria whereas pnsb are alfaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria gsb belong to the phylum chlorobi and are characterized by having bchl c d or e organized into large light-harvesting organelles known as chlorosomes 4 these organisms contain type i reaction centers and typically oxidize sulfur compounds for co 2 fixation compared to the purple bacteria the gsb have much more restricted growth requirements they are strict anaerobic obligate phototrophic and obligate autotrophic filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic fap bacteria belong to the phylum chloroflexi and are characterized by having bchl a organized into type ii reaction centers and light-harvesting antennae similar to those found in purple bacteria 4 there are two kinds of faps the red faps have bchl a as the sole chlorophyll-like pigment whereas the green faps in addition to bchl a also have bchl c or d organized in chlorosome structures similar to those found in gsb the green faps are also known as green nonsulfur bacteria the only other groups of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria known are the heliobacteria chloracidobacteria and the recently discovered gemmamonatiales 7 there are no known archaea that contain photochemical reaction centers cyanobacteria are oxygenic phototrophs 8 however a few cyanobacteria are capable of anoxygenic photosynthesis and an anaerobic phototrophic lifestyle where the organisms consume hydrogen sulfide as electron donor for photosynthesis very similar to the phototrophic gsb and psb described above microalgae are also oxygenic phototrophs but are not known to grow phototrophically under anaerobic conditions however this does not exclude the possibility that some microalgae have light-independent lifestyles under anaerobic conditions or in the dark in general anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria thrive where anaerobic conditions intersect with light 4 in natural environments these conditions occur in lakes and sediments often in narrow bands limited by the extent of light penetration if sulfide is present typically either psb or gsb or both accumulate purple bacteria in general are physiologically versatile and thrive in many man-made polluted environments such as wastewater lagoons where light coincides with anaerobic or microaerobic conditions and high loads of organic compounds simplified model of the oxidative sulfur

sulfur compound oxidizing system sqr sulfide quinone oxidoreductase modified from 9 although sulfide is metabolized by most if not all phototrophic bacteria the levels of tolerance vary significantly 9 sulfide concentrations above 15–30 mg/l h 2 s 0.5–1 mm tend to inhibit the pnsb and favor the psb and gsb the highest sulfide concentrations tolerated by most psb and gsb are about 100–150 mg/l h 2 s about 3–5 mm where the gsb typically are the most tolerant in extreme cases up to 375 mg/l h 2 s 11 mm is tolerated sulfide is a malodorous corrosive and toxic compound often present in liquid waste streams from domestic and industrial sources the source is typically organically bound sulfur which is liberated as sulfide or sulfate upon degradation and inorganic sulfur mostly sulfate which is reduced to sulfide under anaerobic conditions by ubiquitous sulfate-reducing bacteria anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria offer an environmentally friendly biological approach to remove this sulfide 10 partial oxidation of h 2 s to elemental sulfur s 0 rather than complete oxidation to sulfate so 4 2− is desirable for a number of reasons 1 elemental sulfur can be physically removed from the waste stream by sedimentation of the sulfur granules this alleviates downstream problems with sulfate such as reduction to sulfide by sulfate-reducing bacteria in addition this biogenic elemental sulfur has commercial value as fertilizer and chemical feedstock 2 oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur generates less h than oxidation of sulfide to sulfate this minimizes corrosion and the requirement for ph control 3 conversion to elemental sulfur requires less light than conversion to sulfate this maximizes the sulfide removal per light input for these reasons conditions in the photobioreactor pbr have to be carefully controlled e.g. flow rate light intensity to avoid complete sulfide oxidation and to maximize the output of elemental sulfur alternatively naturally occurring or genetically engineered strains of phototrophic sulfur bacteria could be used which are deficient in sulfate formation and only oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur regardless of the sulfide load 11 for sulfide removal from waste streams gsb have certain advantages over other anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria 10 1 gsb deposit elemental sulfur extracellularly which enables recovery of the sulfur by sedimentation most psb accumulate the elemental sulfur intracellularly 2 gsb oxidize more sulfide per light input than purple bacteria which is important for practical design and economic reasons 3 gsb have higher tolerance for sulfide and higher affinity for sulfide uptake than purple bacteria 4 sulfide uptake in purple bacteria is diminished when organic nutrients are available for these reasons if a defined microbial culture is to be used for photobiological sulfide removal a gsb culture may be beneficial in one such study a pilot-scale fixed-film continuous-flow pbr 21 ml with the gsb chlorobium limicola strain dsm 257 was designed and successfully optimized for sulfide removal 12 at loading rates of 111–286 mg/l/h sulfide about 100 of the influent sulfide was consumed and 92–95 recovered as elemental sulfur 12 in another pilot-scale study in brazil up-flow anaerobic pbrs were tested with a continuous flow of domestic wastewater containing 1–6 mg/l sulfide 13 these systems relied on naturally developing microbial communities under the influence of natural light sulfide removal efficiencies reached 90 and the effluent contained less than 0.5 mg/l sulfide which is below the national sulfide discharge standard in brazil of 1 mg/l most of the sulfide was oxidized to elemental sulfur s 0 although some sulfate so 4 2− was also formed the sulfide was oxidized by a mixed microbial community which was shown by molecular techniques to contain gsb psb of the chromatiaceae lineage and green faps of the chloronema lineage sulfide removal by chemotrophic denitrification was unlikely to occur because the influent and effluent wastewater contained very little nitrate and nitrite and microbes capable of preforming this process were not identified in the microbial community hydrogen sulfide is present in small amounts in biogas typically 0.1–2 and off-gases from wastewater treatment plants for example besides being toxic and malodorous h 2 s in biogas causes corrosion and poisoning of the equipment using the biogas therefore a number of chemical technologies are currently used to remove h 2 s from biogas a commercialized approach using chemotrophic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria in a fixed-film bioreactor under controlled oxygen conditions is also available 14 fixed-film or suspended-growth pbrs with anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria could be interesting alternatives for cost-effective h 2 s removal because of their ability to operate for long periods of time without requiring a biomass separation step and their ability to operate under high and variable sulfide loadings 14 illumination and design of the pbr is a key concern for practical application because light is rapidly attenuated in dense cell suspensions 15 studies suggest that illumination using light-emitting diodes led appears to be a very cost-effective approach if the led emission wavelength is matched to the pigment absorption by the cells 16 a variety of reactor designs have been investigated which allow the influent gas to exchange h 2 s with an aqueous medium containing suspended or immobilized sulfide-oxidizing bacteria in one study a continuous-stirred pbr with chlorobium thiosulfatophilum was used to remove sulfide from a synthetic gas stream containing 2.5 h 2 s 17 at its optimum operation the 1.25-l pbr consumed 118 mg/h h 2 s with negligible formation of sulfate corresponding to a conversion rate of sulfide to elemental sulfur per pbr volume of about 100 mg/h/l h 2 s. another study with a larger pbr working volume 11.9 l used a flat-panel gas-lift pbr design with a pbr thickness of 10 cm and led illumination 16 in this system the sulfide conversion to elemental sulfur was only about 20 mg/h/l h 2 s but the energy expenditure for illumination per amount of sulfide removed was the lowest reported in the literature because of the use of led for illumination azo dyes are the most important group of synthetic colorants and are generally recalcitrant to biodegradation because of their xenobiotic nature degradation of azo dyes in wastewater streams is most efficient under anaerobic conditions because many anaerobic bacteria apparently have a broad-range ability to reduce the azo bond 18 azo dyes are decolorized by many pnsb and this degradation is dependent on the enzyme azoreductase 19 20 pure culture studies with different isolates of rhodopseudomonas palustris have shown that this organism efficiently decolorizes various azo dyes in concentrations of around 1 g/l dye 20 21 in these studies decolorization and at least partial degradation of azo dyes occurred only under anaerobic conditions and in the light in another study different pnsb strains isolated from various water sources rhodobacter adriaticus rhodobacter blasticus rhodobacter capsulatus rhodovulum strictum and r. palustris decolorized up to 96 of the tested azo dyes after only 2 days of illuminated and anaerobic incubation 22 to circumvent problems associated with wastewater treatment using suspended cultures of bacteria wang and colleagues constructed a pbr to treat azo dye-contaminated wastewater 23 the naturally developed biofilm contained anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria related to the rhodopseudomonas rhodomicrobium and chlorobium lineages this pbr allowed the removal of most of the organic load and up to 90 of the azo dyes over a 30-day run the predominant phototrophic bacteria in the biofilm changed from purple bacteria to a mixture of purple and gsb and finally to mainly gsb during this period the decolorization of azo dye increased from 60 to 90 suggesting that gsb may also be capable of efficiently decolorizing azo dyes purple bacteria belonging to the rhodospirillum and rhodopseudomonas genera have also been investigated for use in anaerobic biodegradation of halogenated aromatic pollutants such as 3-chlorobenzoate 5 24 microorganisms – dead or alive free or immobilized – can be used to remove toxic metals and radioisotopes from the environment 25 among anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria this ability has especially been studied in pnsb 5 the pnsb rhodobacter sphaeroides bioaccumulates heavy metals including cadmium cd nickel ni and lead pb 26 27 28 and metals with radioactive isotopes cesium cs and strontium sr 29 in one study r. sphaeroides strain s accumulated cd 2+ with a higher efficiency under aerobic-dark conditions 93 than under anaerobic-light conditions 50 over 7 days at an initial cd 2+ concentration of 5 mg/l 27 however the ability to bioaccumulate metal ions is dependent on the strain of the organism under investigation r. sphaeroides strain ssi is a spontaneous mutant of r. sphaeroides strain s with an increased ability to produce extracellular polymeric substances eps on the cell surface 29 the ssi strain has been shown to remove efficiently toxic metals including cadmium uranium u cobalt co mercury hg and chromium cr the removal of these metals has been attributed to the high amount of eps produced on the surface of strain ssi because the strong negative charges of eps efficiently adsorb many different kinds of metal ions in one experimental setup with immobilized cells of strain ssi and 5 mg/l of each cs and sr 2+ about 100 of the cesium and 50 of the strontium were removed in 3 days other strains of r. sphaeroides and other pnsb have also been shown to remove efficiently 90 copper cu 2+ zinc zn 2+ and cd 2+ from contaminated shrimp pond water 30 zinc consumption by live r. capsulatus strain b10 cells has been reported at levels of 164 mg zn 2+ per gram of cell dry weight 31 this is among the highest zinc biosorption capacities reported for any microorganism and this suggests that r. capsulatus could be useful for zinc bioremediation the unusually high zinc biosorption capacity was again mainly attributed to the physicochemical properties of the eps on the cell surface hydrogen h 2 has potential as an environmentally friendly fuel most if not all oxygenic as well as anoxygenic phototrophic microorganisms have the capacity to produce h 2 but the physiological mechanisms for h 2 production vary among these organisms 32 here only h 2 production in anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria is considered although h 2 production from phototrophic bacteria may not be economically viable by itself h 2 could be a valuable byproduct from other application of these organisms such as wastewater or biogas cleanup 33 photobiological h 2 formation is catalyzed either by a hydrogenase 2h 2e − ⇆ h 2 or by nitrogenase as a byproduct from n 2 fixation 8h n 2 8e − → h 2 2nh 3 most bacteria have the ability to re-uptake the produced h 2 so this ability may have to be eliminated if the h 2 production is to be useful in rhodospirillum rubrum and other pnsb photobiological h 2 production is primarily caused by nitrogenase and therefore h 2 production is induced under nitrogen limitation interestingly if n 2 is completely removed for example by using an inert gas nitrogenase produces exclusively h 2 and thus the h 2 productivity is increased in a nitrogen-limited batch culture of r. rubrum a continuous production of 0.48 l/day h 2 per gram cell dry weight was observed with lactate as electron donor 34 r. rubrum and other purple bacteria also catalyze light-dependent h 2 production from co with a net reaction corresponding to the water-gas shift reaction co h 2 o → h 2 co 2 35 gsb also exhibit light- and nitrogenase-dependent h 2 production in these bacteria inorganic sulfur compounds sulfide sulfur and thiosulfate are electron donors for photosynthesis and h 2 production photobiological h 2 production from organic compounds using these bacteria was demonstrated in a syntrophic co-culture of the gsb chlorobium vibrioforme and the acetate-oxidizing sulfur-reducing bacterium desulfuromonas acetoxidans 36 in this co-culture the chemotrophic partner oxidized acetate and reduced sulfur to h 2 s and the phototrophic partner oxidized h 2 s back to sulfur and produced h 2 using nitrogenase in this co-culture the productivity was 1.3 l/day h 2 per gram cell dry weight with acetate as electron donor an alternative approach to photobiological h 2 production in gsb might be engineered in principle the redox potentials of the type i photochemical reaction center e 0 ′ approx −0.6 v and the soluble ferredoxins e 0 ′ approx −0.5 v in gsb are low enough to allow reduction of h to h 2 e 0 ′ −0.42 v these strong cellular reductants are required for co 2 fixation by the reductive tca cycle found in gsb however this reducing power might also be used for photobiological h 2 production if a suitable hydrogenase could be inserted in these organisms that would accept electrons from the indigenous strong reductants then h 2 production would be independent of n 2 and nitrogenase examples of carotenoids found in anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria from 39 and carotenoid database http //carotenoiddb.jp/ the most important role of carotenoids in phototrophic organisms is in protection from light 40 the detrimental effects of light are much more serious under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions because excitation of bacterio chlorophylls under aerobic conditions causes formation of reactive oxygen species ros mechanistically this occurs by reaction of excited triplet-state chlorophyll 3 chl* with ground-state molecular oxygen o 2 which results in formation of singlet oxygen 1 o 2 singlet oxygen is extremely reactive and detrimental to the cell carotenoids quench 3 chl* and thereby prevent formation of singlet oxygen this means carotenoids can not be completely removed from phototrophic organisms growing under aerobic conditions however phototrophic bacteria growing under anaerobic conditions do not have this requirement and therefore carotenoids are not essential for anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria this in turn means the carotenoids of these bacteria in principle are freely available for biosynthetic engineering genetic engineering has been used to synthesize the commercially valuable carotenoid lycopene in the purple non-sulfur bacterium r. rubrum 41 here the indigenous carotenoid biosynthetic pathway was interrupted by targeted gene inactivation and as a result the cells accumulated lycopene as the sole carotenoid in a content of 2 mg/g cell dry weight although this is not high compared to the yield obtained in genetically engineered e. coli 33 mg/g cell dry weight lycopene as the sole carotenoid 42 additional engineering of r. rubrum could surely increase the yield using a similar approach lycopene and zeta-carotene have also been produced as the sole carotenoid species in gsb by genetic manipulation of chlorobaculum tepidum 43 because carotenoids are not required in anaerobic phototrophic bacteria the flux of isoprene precursors to carotenoid biosynthesis in these organisms could be redirected to any isoprenoid compound such as valuable plant-type terpenoids 44 to study the structure and function of proteins it is useful to overexpress the proteins in a foreign host organism to obtain amounts sufficient for experimentation however membrane proteins pose a challenge because they often denature in the absence of a suitable membrane environment for example heterologous membrane proteins that are overexpressed in e. coli in a functional form are usually found in much lower titers than heterologous soluble proteins and tend to form inclusion bodies to overcome this problem the pnsb rba sphaeroides has been developed as a host for overexpression of functional membrane proteins 45 this system takes advantage of the large content of intracellular membranes in purple bacteria which hold the membrane-bound antennae and enzymes of the photochemical machinery in rba sphaeroides these internal membranes form intracytoplasmic membrane icm vesicles that sequester newly synthesized foreign proteins and enable easy purification following cell lysis using this system challenging membrane proteins in a functional form have recently been prepared and examined human aquaporin 9 haqp9 human tight junction protein occludin occ rba
