doing great work over 2015 contributing thousands of volunteer hours to the community and here is an update on what has been happening icecycles inner city east cycles has details of workshops pictures available here and on facebook highlights over 2015 have been moving our base to the phillipstown community hub and building some racks for storing wheels tyres bikes removing pedals turning handlebars meant we could stack a lot more bikes in and avoid a nightmare of tangled parts in heaps on the floor fixing up 156 bikes over our 6 workshops held at different locations in central/eastern christchurch communities restoring and giving away 117 bikes to people who could not afford a bike and did not have ability to restore their own they were often referred by a case worker from various social service agencies assisting bikes for madagascar to collect 400 bikes which will be restored and used by community workers in madagascar small funding grants have been received from piko wholefood trust and rotary some of our happy customers can afford donations and the odd upmarket bike is sold which all adds up to cover the few thousand dollars of costs for new parts replacement tools we require to operate a new smoothie bike was created with the blender at the front so the pedaller can see what is going on a 5m long banner trailer was constructed to display our icecycles banner for events like the climate change parade santa parade and to park outside our community workshops 2016 will be mostly the same with the possible addition of running some bike maintenance tutorials through hagley community college later in the year we did explore the possibility of making three wheeler bikes for people with balance problems out of our reject frames and the prototype was great fun to ride with two steering wheels at the front but the market for them was not very enthusiastic so would be hard to cover the costs of production a worthwhile project if you have time welding skills though christchurch rad bikes by jess smale rad bikes recycle a dunger is a not-for-profit community bike shed in central christchurch rad was begun in 2013 and continues to run regular
