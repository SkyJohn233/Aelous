What is a Split Digraph? - Twinkl Teaching Wiki Split digraphs are taught during Phase 5 in the Letters and Sounds scheme of work. Teachers may introduce split digraphs to children by showing the digraphs in isolation (E.g.  i-e ) and teaching them the sound it makes. They will then show children words containing the split digraph so that children can practice reading it in a word. They may ask children to spot the split digraph and trace it with their finger.  Once children are familiar with the split digraph, they will be able to notice it in words and sound it out, along with the other digraphs in the word. Children will then progress to attempting to spell words with split digraphs.  The magic 'e' is another name that is used by teachers when introducing Split Digraphs to students, this is done to make spelling more fun and engaging for learners. The 'e' is doing a job, it isn't just magic, for example, it can change the sounds and meanings of words such  rag  with the magic 'e' it becomes  rage  which has a whole new meaning and pronunciation.  You could use this  Split Digraph PowerPoint  to revise all the split digraphs and give children practice reading words which include them. Split digraphs are also known as 'modifying e' or 'magic e,' although these are outdated terms.
