In this chapter I discuss why calcareous soils have a greater diversity of species than acid soils in Europe, whereas in Australia the opposite is true. One of the explanations to the great species diversity among plants is that there are many ways of adapting to the nutrient levels in the soil. Mycorrhizal fungi in the soil can also be a determining factor for diversity, but the conditions are different in Europe and America. During my walks in Hörjelgården, a farm where land is used in the same way as in the 1700s, I reflect on why the agricultural landscape has become increasingly species-poor. I also consider the adaptations of plants during hikes in the mountains and on the limestone plain of Öland. Sometimes, plants can indicate the presence of metals in the ground and there are several examples of how they have helped geologists to locate valuable ore. The chapter concludes with an example in which a beautiful ridge landscape is exploited and converted into an open sand quarry. When the sand quarry is later abandoned, it turns into an attractive area for solitary bees, where children’s games create the conditions for the bees’ survival. At midsummer the flower was herself, her wingbeats the essence of summer. From sprout to seed she flew on red poppy wings. Harry Martinson When hiking in Sarek National Park, majestic mountains with evocative names like Akka, Sarvatjåkkå and Pierikpakte surround you. For all the grandeur, there is scenery on a smaller scale that is also worth watching, though you may have to look carefully. After hiking for hours, the white petals of a mountain avens suddenly appear at your feet. Is the flower growing here by coincidence or because the soil is different? Necessity — the mother of invention.  Phosphorus is a vital plant nutrient. In calcareous soils, plants find it hard to obtain phosphorus because of its affinity for calcium, to which it binds closely. Plants have sought to overcome this through various evolutionary adaptations, and calcareous soils are often rich in flora as a result. This diversity can be observed in places like Sarek national park in northern Sweden and on the Baltic island of Öland, which lies on calcareous bedrock One day in early August I stepped off the bus at the Sourva hydropower dam near Stora Sjöfallet National Park, which lies just to the north of Sarek. Accompanying me were Johan and Joakim, two hikers highly experienced in exploring this expanse of wilderness. Our first job was to divide the camping gear between us. I drew the task of carrying the four-kilogram three-man tent and Johan the ultra-light portable stove. Joakim carried arguably the most valuable cargo in his head: his intimate knowledge of hiking in Sarek. It took us two days to reach Pielavalta, the high plateau in the centre of Sarek National Park and site for our base camp. It was my turn to cook the evening meal and, to my friends’ surprise, I produced a fresh egg. Who knows, maybe I was the first of Sarek’s many weight-conscious hikers to carry an uncooked egg halfway across the park. But I needed it to cook the lentil burgers I planned to make that evening. I let the dried corn and green lentils soak in the hot water before mixing in the egg and instant mash potato and frying the patties in olive oil. After a long day of hiking we all ate heartily. The day after we visited a magnesite quarry on the northern face of Ähpar, above Lake Vuoinesluobbalah. Five hundred tonnes of magnesite were mined here during World War II to make fire-resistant stone linings for steel kilns. The quarry was abandoned after six months due to a plane accident—a mishap that saved Sarek from further development. I became interested in the quarry, located in the most botanically interesting area of Sarek, after reading about it in Swedish writer and photographer Claes Grundsten’s books. Magnesite consists of magnesium carbonate, an unusual mineral that resembles calcite (calcium carbonate). Both calcite and magnesite affect soil conditions in similar ways, their carbonate turning water in the soil alkaline by binding acidic hydrogen ions. The flytrap.  Plants that live in extremely nitrogen-deprived environments must adapt to survive. The sticky leaves of this alpine butterwort have captured insects that the plant’s enzymes will slowly dissolve to provide a much-needed nitrogen supplement. Another carnivorous plant is the marsh-dwelling sundew At first glance, the vegetation along the streams running down the hillside from the quarry looked no different from what we had encountered in the previous two days. This disappointed Joakim, who was hoping to learn more about Sarek thanks to my botanical expertise. But after taking off my backpack and examining the ground on hands and knees I found a few knobbly branches growing close to the surface, the leathery leaves and aromatic scent confirming the presence of  Rhododendron lapponicum —one of only two wild rhododendron species in Sweden. In due course I found Alpine arnica, Arctic bellflower, and Arctic white heather, three calcareous soil species. Joakim’s mood began to lift. The highlight came when we found Alpine butterwort, an insect-eating plant that evolved its carnivorous habits as a dietary supplement in nitrogen-poor soil. Alpine butterwort is a low-growing plant with sticky leaves which trap insects and slowly dissolve them with digestive enzymes. It is said that you can make sour milk from alpine butterwort if you mash the leaves with a wooden spoon and add milk. Eagle eyes are sometimes needed to spot nature’s nuggets. But the more one understands the interplay between soil and plants, the more one appreciates the subtle changes that occur—changes that generally elude the layperson. I learned a lot about horticulture when I spent a summer at Capellagården School in the village of Lilla Vickleby on the Baltic island of Öland. While I pottered about in the vegetable patch, the other students would paint watercolours of the unique Öland landscape, and the shifting colours of their work reminded me of the light that Claes Grundsten so ably captured in his Sarek photographs. The plaintive whistle of the golden plover can be heard in both places, and while the Montagu’s harriers that frequent Öland’s agricultural landscape occur only in southern Sweden, their elegant flight and narrow wings reminded me of the long-tailed skuas I saw at Pielavalta. The carpet of flowers is more vivid on Öland than on Sarek’s hillsides. Öland’s limestone plateau, or  alvar , is topped by calcareous soil that in early summer is ablaze with orchids including Adam and Eve, military and burnt-tip. A plant ecologist might be reluctant to label classic Öland specialties like hoary rock-rose or fern-leaf dropwort as calcareous flora, even though they grow exclusively on chalk and limestone soil. It is not the chalk or limestone that holds the key here, but the calcium ions that drive phosphorus from the soil solution when they form insoluble compounds with phosphate ions. Species like dock and speedwell, which avoid calcareous soil, quickly suffer the effects of phosphorus deficiency if they germinate in calcareous soil, in contrast to typical alvar species which have adapted to life in calcium-rich earth by being able to absorb phosphorus even when it is in short supply. Dock will, however, thrive in topsoil from which calcium has leached due to acidic rainwater, and in such conditions can pose a threat to other alvar-dependent species. Many calcareous sandy steppe areas in the eastern Skåne region of southernmost Sweden have suffered degradation of this sort, though efforts to remove the topsoil or restore calcium-rich soil to the upper layer have successfully benefited the calcareous grassland flora. The rich flora of the Öland alvar and Sarek’s magnesite quarry epitomises the resourcefulness of plants in adapting to phosphorus scarcity. Some species secrete organic acids from their roots that enable them to absorb phosphate ions. Many enter a symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi to augment their phosphorus intake in return for providing access to the carbohydrates the plants produce during photosynthesis. Some plants even specialise in parasitising others’ adaptations in order to gain access to phosphorus. Inadequate supplies of phosphorus limit the growth of all plants but also create scope for more life forms than a nutrient-rich environment where a handful of fast-growing species can outcompete the others. Phosphorus provider.  When  Carex  and other sedges can grow amazingly intricate root hairs when exposed to phosphorus deficiency. These produce organic acids that lower the soil pH to release the elusive phosphorus. The root hairs only grow in extremely phosphorus-poor soils and are absent in nutrient-rich farmland. But if we could breed sedge varieties to grow root hairs even in nutrient-rich conditions, we could perhaps access the phosphorus that lies trapped in farmland from decades of fertiliser use, thereby tapping a valuable resource at a time when global phosphorus reserves are running low Competitive grass.  Grass has a finely branched root system reminiscent of a mycorrhizal fungus mycelium. The vast majority of plant species have less developed root systems and depend more on collaboration with fungi to ensure nutrient uptake. Fertilising nutrient-poor land benefits grasses but disadvantages species that depend on mycorrhizal fungi. Adding fertiliser to a meadow full of wild flowers can rapidly turn it into monotonous grassland The symbiosis between mycorrhizal fungi and plants was discovered in the 1930s in Florida during successful attempts to control a parasitic fungus that was attacking the roots of orange and lemon trees. Scientists found that the saplings would not grow, even when the fungus was removed, unless large quantities of phosphorus were added. On closer inspection, they discovered another type of fungal structures on the wild saplings that were absent in their cultivated congeners. The scientists suspected this fungus was helping the wild saplings to absorb phosphorus—a hypothesis they proved by adding soil from wild orange and lemon trees, which allowed the fungus to recolonise and the cultivated saplings to grow normally again. Since then, Florida’s orange and lemon growers always ensure their trees’ roots are colonised by mycorrhizal fungi. Scientists in the Netherlands have investigated the importance of the role played by mycorrhizal fungi for plant structure in different places and environments. They have been able to demonstrate that if you sterilise earth from a flower meadow, put it in pots and plant it with meadow flower seeds, it is not possible to replicate the meadow biotope. All that will grow are a variety of grass species; the flowers remain conspicuous by their absence. Things change radically, however, if you add spores of mycorrhizal fungi. All of a sudden, the meadow flowers germinate and bloom. This is because many flowers have thick roots that need mycorrhizal fungi to absorb phosphorus. If the fungi are absent, the flowers are outcompeted by grasses, which have more delicate root systems better able to absorb phosphorus unaided. Mycorrhizal fungi are not alone in affecting plant life. Other fungi can infect plant roots and even kill the host. Rare plant species are often especially sensitive to such fungi, their very rarity being the result of having to colonise new areas to mitigate against fungal attacks. Commoner species have generally evolved more effective defence mechanisms. Some rarer species manage to retain a foothold by choosing areas subject to disturbance. Marram grass, for example, grows in sand dunes that are continually being shaped and shifted by the wind. Their roots are sensitive to fungal attack but the plant is periodically covered in sand, which enables new roots to grow and replace the old ones as they perish. If the sand dunes stabilise, resulting in the sand remaining fixed in place, marram grass cannot survive for long. Peat - loving rhododendrons.  If you want to plant rhododendron, or other heathers, in your garden, it is best to replace the ordinary soil with coarsely shredded unlimed peat. These plants thrive in acidic soil and form a symbiosis with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, which are experts at releasing nitrogen-rich amino acids from peat and other organic material. Weeds require easily accessible nitrogen and are rarely a problem in these conditions Crowberry, blueberry, bearberry and other members of the heather family predominate in tundra environments, where the soil is acidic and nutrient-poor. They have adapted to this environment by evolving thin, hairy roots that form dense lattice networks in the organic topsoil. Cells in these hairy roots are full of fungal hyphae of another mycorrhizal type than that found in grass and herbs. The mycorrhizal fungi found in members of the heather family secrete enzymes that release nitrogen and phosphorus from complex organic compounds in the soil. A few years ago I took part in an experiment in Abisko in which we added radioactive carbon dioxide to tundra plants enclosed under plastic covers. The plants absorbed the carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and the radioactive isotope enabled us to observe the carbon on its journey down into the soil. I asked one of my students to extract roots from the soil so we could analyse how much carbon entered the fungal tissue that filled the cells, a task that proved virtually impossible as the samples were enmeshed in spidery roots that were extremely difficult to separate from the surrounding soil. Nevertheless, after many painstaking hours under the microscope, we eventually developed enough samples and were able to see that the fungi utilised the plant’s photosynthetic products heavily during the major part of the growing season. Geology and fungal presence are not the only factors that determine what plant species can grow in which soil: the way we humans manage the land is also critical. Traditional hay meadows and pasture are rich in flora but difficult to replicate in a suburban garden, though you might suppose otherwise considering all the meadow seed varieties you can buy at your local garden centre. Garden soil is often too high in nutrients, and depleting soil of nutrients is no easy task. My father would sow meadow flower seeds on a large patch of land at his summer cabin in southern Sweden. But even when the seeds germinated, it did not take long for grass to take over and outcompete the flowers. A few years ago he began mowing the meadow with a scythe and removing the cuttings. The results have been promising and slowly the land is starting to look like a meadow. Removing nutrients from the soil is a painstaking job, but worth the effort in the knowledge that a meadow rich in flowers will quickly be ruined by adding fertiliser. At Hörjelgården Farm in eastern Skåne, southernmost Sweden, the land has been carefully managed in recent years to restore it to how it would have looked in the eighteenth century. Schoolchildren visit the farm to learn about how people farmed and lived on the land in those days. The grass meadow is cut with a scythe and the hay used to feed the farm animals during winter. Back in the old days, the tradition was to cut the meadow when the seeds pods of the greater yellow-rattle began to rattle in the wind. Only then was the hay dry enough to be stored for winter (eighteenth century farmers had no fans for hay-drying). The flowers that seeded before the meadow was cut survived until the following year; late-blooming species had to look elsewhere for a foothold. The big challenge for eighteenth century farmers was to avoid depleting the soil. Meadows provided winter fodder for livestock, whose manure was used on the fields to add nitrogen and phosphorus. This process depleted the meadows, but typical meadow flowers, with their small leaves that are not energy-intensive to grow and slow growth cycles, are highly economical with nutrients. A diverse array of species can share the space when no single species grows large and dominates. Nutrient-intensive species like nettles and broad-leaved grasses survived on compost heaps and near outdoor toilets by growing extensive root systems, but were unable to survive on the meadows. Nutrient-rich areas were uncommon in the agricultural landscapes of yesteryear, and most plant species were adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. Today, nutrient-requiring species have expanded and the nitrogen content of the soil has increased because of man-made pollution. Artificially fertilised algal bloom.  Nitrogen supply has increased in the industrialised world during the last century. Nitrogen oxides are formed during combustion and are released by car engines, for example. Ammonia—a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen—evaporates from livestock barns and manure piles. Grass grows better, but at the expense of flowering plants, when this nitrogen reaches the soil. Algae also benefit, forming a near-phosphorescent coating on tree trunks, buildings and, as here, on fence posts The advent of artificial fertiliser was a disaster for meadow flora, which were choked by grass when fertiliser was spread on meadows. Much of the nitrogen ends up in watercourses and ultimately in the sea, where it can be a major hazard. Increased concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in marine environments can result in algal blooms. Eutrophication is today one of our most serious environmental problems, on a par with the twin challenges of climate change and the mass extinction of species that are accompanying our unrelenting exploitation of the Earth’s resources. Hoofmarks.  Livestock grazing and trampling shapes plant communities. Grass withstands grazing because the animals cannot reach all the way down to the leaf buds at the base of the plant. The buttercup forms substances that cows cannot tolerate and grows commonly in grazed fields. Grazing also benefits low-growing species that would otherwise be overshadowed by tall grass. Some species thrive in the disturbed soils trampled by cattle, while others grow unhindered in thorny thickets the cows cannot reach Thoughtful thorns.  In Africa, the leaves of the acacia tree are attractive food for grazing animals such as wild gazelles, sheep and goats. To avoid being grazed bare, the tree has evolved strong thorns on its lower branches within animals’ reach. Higher up, towards the crown, it does not need to waste its resources on these costly constructions The pasture and meadow at Hörjelgården farm has never been cultivated or fertilised. Here, up to forty different species of plant can be found in a single square metre, including rare grasses such as mat-weed, common heath grass and quaking-grass, and flowers ranging from orchids to mountain bugle. This biotope has suffered a drastic decline since the eighteenth century and only remnants survive nowadays. Even if we seek to preserve the last vestiges by creating nature reserves and banning fertiliser use, these areas remain vulnerable to human impact in the form of nitrates carried in rainwater and emanating from car exhaust fumes as well as ammonia released into the air from livestock farming. Solitary bees.  Adjacent to my plot of land in Torna Hällestad, southern Sweden, lies a field known as “rabbitland”. In the mornings and evenings, the sunlight plays on the dry grass, making it almost look as though it were on fire. Local council workers regularly rough up the field with machinery to create optimal habitat for wild bees, which thrive in sand exposed to the sun. Controlled burning is also carried out to reduce the spread of tall oatgrass. On this morning, frost is sparkling in the remains of the burnt grass Not all bees form colonies; some live alone. The open sand at rabbitland creates favourable conditions for solitary sand bees ( Andrena vaga ), which excavate burrows in the sand. Here a female sand bee looks out of her nest. The area is protected to provide a sanctuary for the endangered bees The sandy ground became a haven for rabbits and my neighbour’s dachshund honed a special technique for opening the back door so it could go out and hunt the bunnies. The locals also enjoyed the influx and people still talk of garden cages baited with carrots. Once seven or eight rabbits had entered a cage, the homeowner would heave it towards the house using a rope. If they were lucky, a couple of rabbits might still be in the cage—enough for a nice stew. A wave of myxomatosis in the 1970s decimated the rabbit population, and the species is now scarce here. Conservationists want them back in numbers to control the false oat-grass that takes over if nitrogen content becomes too high in the soil. False oat-grass outcompetes low-growing species like dwarf everlast and stonecrop. Rabbits can only graze tender false oat-grass shoots; controlled burning is needed when the grass gets too thick—a method that also combusts some of the nitrogen content. Another method is to grow rye and then harvest the crop as a way of removing soil nutrients. Jasione and stonecrop are popular sources of pollen and nectar for the many insects that live at rabbitland—and the combination of a rich flora and sandy soil makes the area one of the best in Sweden for wild ground-dwelling bees. Forty-five different species occur here, many of them threatened and in decline both in Sweden and internationally. In the middle of the area is a gentle hollow where I often pause on my nightly strolls. We used to call it the long-jump pit when the children were small, and we ran up and down setting new records as the kids grew up. The hollow, dug by local children using buckets and spades in the 1970s, is today one of the best spots for the ground-dwelling bees that have brought the area to the attention of entomologists. The loose sand that slides down the sides of the sandpit creates perfect conditions for the bees. The local authority has copied the sandpit concept by excavating similar hollows throughout the field to improve conditions for the bees. Perhaps it is due to the children that bees now thrive here and large sums of money are being invested to keep encroaching vegetation at bay. Local changes in soil chemistry can sometimes cause abrupt changes in the local flora. Heavy metals occur naturally in some soils, and just as they are toxic to humans, so they can be harmful to plants in high concentrations, though some species have learnt to adapt to such conditions. Plant mapping is used widely internationally to discover new mineral deposits. Geotechnical engineers discovered the area in Kastad, Norway, with high concentrations of lead in the soil (see previous chapter) by studying changes in the flora using satellite images. Alpine catchfly has been used to indicate copper deposits and alpine chickweed to denote the presence of serpentine, a rare mineral created under special conditions during the formation of mountain ranges by movements in the Earth’s tectonic plates. Serpentine presence results in nutrient-poor soil with high concentrations of heavy metals such as nickel, chromium and cobalt. Most plants—apart from alpine catchfly—cannot tolerate such environments. Various similar examples can be found around the world. In the US state of Oregon, for example, Douglas fir gives way to pine in areas of serpentine soil as the latter can tolerate the heavy metals present in the soil. Heavy metals.  This cross-section comes from a spruce that grew very slowly because it stood on serpentinite bedrock. Over twenty-five years, the trunk diameter increased by just two centimetres, whereas another nearby spruce, which stood on amphibolite bedrock, grew as much in four years. Soils on serpentinite bedrock are high in heavy metals but low in potassium, which is the most critical element for plants after nitrogen Some plants are capable of storing large concentrations of heavy metals in special structures, effectively neutralising them. Such plants, such as willow—known for its ability to store cadmium—can be used to remediate contaminated ground. Pollution from cadmium compounds in artificial fertiliser is a widespread problem in agricultural soils. Willows grown near water treatment plants can effectively purify the water and be later harvested for biomass. It is, however, important to collect the ash and dispose of it safely to avoid re-releasing it to the environment. Arsenic is a deadly heavy metal and one of the most carcinogenic substances known to science. It occurs naturally in certain types of rock and is responsible for polluting many wells in India and Bangladesh. However, a potential solution has emerged in the form of a Chinese fern that can store arsenic in its leaves. The fern will only grow in warm and moist climates but scientists hope they can use genetic engineering to graft its arsenic-storing properties onto other plants, especially those with large root systems capable of purifying substantial expanses of ground. But soil contains much more than plant roots. It is teeming with microorganisms, and it is here that soil biodiversity reaches its zenith, as we will discover in the next chapter.
