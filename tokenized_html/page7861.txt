river winds and flows its way through the 100-acre nature preserve on the newbridge on the charles campus quiet but for frogs on the shore and birds in the air at this time of year then the sounds of chatter from an adventurous group of newbridge residents and friends rise over the river as along with their guide from the l.l.bean outdoor discovery school they help each other don water safety vests as they prepare for a morning kayak trip on the river for many it was the first time they tried kayaking for all it was the first time they kayaked on the charles river and fully explored the natural beauty of their own backyard the newly built canoe and kayak launch on the newbridge campus made it all possible just a short walk from their front doors for seniors who love paddle sports of all kinds newbridge is one of few continuing care retirement communities in the united states with a canoe and kayak launch the launch provides access to the charles river waterway at 80 miles the charles is the longest river within massachusetts the stretch of the river along the newbridge campus is identified as the dedham water trail wildflowers wild rhododendron and abundant bird and aquatic life can all be spotted from the banks of the charles the dedham water trail was designated a national scenic recreation trail in 2014 the water trail offers a complete loop of the charles and includes trail markers at environmentally and historically significant locations with a guided interpretive map resident peter halfon expressed his enjoyment of the kayaking trip although peter was one of the first residents of newbridge six years ago he had never been on the charles river or done much kayaking i will kayak more here at newbridge in the future and look forward to exploring more of the river trail peter said maybe some residents will even share in the cost of a canoe or kayak that we can use together the addition of our canoe and kayak launch and our relationship with the l.l bean outdoor discovery school makes it easier than ever for residents in our community to take advantage of new activities and see new sights in their community the launch adds to our array of recreational activities that can be enjoyed on the newbridge campus and acknowledges the widespread interests of our residents senior living communities today should be more than tennis courts and swimming pools—the senior living experience is one of exploration we can think of no activity that fits the bill more so than a paddle down the river to survey local ecology kayaking can be great exercise for older adults it s an opportunity to experience nature up close and personal that few sports provide kayaking for enhanced mental and physical health puts you right in the moment it fully engages both body and mind in nature some seniors may be reluctant to try kayaking for fear of upending their kayak and falling in the water or struggling to get in and out of the kayak today you can

functions the paddler has lost due to disability or other physical limitations with a little practice and the right instruction you ll quickly learn how to get in and out of a kayak while keeping your
