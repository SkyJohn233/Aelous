Paris to Moscow - Train Travel Forum - TripAdvisor Hi all, Has anybody from Western Europe used the Paris to Moscow train? I would be interested in any reviews, Thanks, Roberto. Here are some interior images, if it helps  www.vagonweb.cz/razeni/vlak.phpâ€¦ Many Thanks. The website is Awesome! Roberto. Good fun, isn ' t it? :) Indeed. Rolling stock heaven! I used it from Paris to Strasbourg, to check it out. Great brand-new 2 and 4 berth  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-68104766', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); cars , I also used the VIP  car  and had a shower - it was affordable just for that section! A great train, with friendly Polish staff in the restaurant  car . Google for Paris-Moscow Express and you ' ll see loads more photos. Many thanks, I am very tempted to take a trip. I am sick of flying....... Robert. This train has actually new stock, and is pleasant to travel - a good alternative to flying. Travelling to Russia might involve a transit visa for Belarus besides Russian visa. Many Thanks, I want to go to Minsk really but the train arrives at 04.00. I am just looking for the right hotel where I can arrive at this time...... Robert. How is the cleaning of sleeper and restaurant  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-71799731', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); car ? Immaculate when I took it. The sleepers were built in 2014, so still pretty new.
