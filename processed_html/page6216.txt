You wont change You wont change for anyone or anything You wont change You wont change for anyone or anything There's nothing I can do There's nothing I can do And I think I'm breaking down... Now I am Taking each breath as if it was my last one Chance to Call out your name in hope that you hear me I am yours now I am yours yours yours You wont change You wont change for anyone or anything You wont change you wont change you wont change you wont change...
