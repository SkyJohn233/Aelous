In association with  Mercury Theater Productions  and Executive Producer, Marc Mercury,  we presented our inaugural production of  THE FULL MONTY  in late 2007 from November 30th through December 22nd and had an extended run in early 2008. The production was staged at  Theatre/Theater  in the heart of mid-city Los Angeles:  5041 W.
