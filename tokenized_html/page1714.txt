the myth of the full-stack developer webdev there will always be people who are generalists and there are people who are specialists same as there is a tool for every job there x27 s an employee for every job role if you need someone to build your newest fastest streaming video delivery network you x27 d pick a specialist if you x27 re a web agency that x27 s turning out websites id suppose you x27 d prefer a few generalists i used to know everything from the 8086 instruction set to the packet format for token-ring to the entire ftp protocol however that was 30 years ago and there x27 s a lot more everything now and i know a smaller percentage of everything by the minute. full stack is only possible if the stack is small enough i firmly believe that a good developer must be full-stack that makes him self-sufficient especially since development in general is so similar a person who can write clean code in php will write clean code in js too syntax is not hard to learn frameworks are not hard to learn also especially if you already know 7 interviewees were given a maximum of 30 points lol at this you formulated a question in such a way that a person can x27 t say he is good at everything and then you say your results prove that which is a well know circular fallacy e.g i always speak the truth and since i say this about myself i am right sql and js knowledge are not mutually exclusive this is not an rpg with skill trees you can x27 t give 30 points to a guy who codes day and night and a freshman with a year of experience but i know how to fix your article mention a budget i would believe that hiring a good full-stack developer is much more expensive than a js-developer simply becaue a full-stack guy fits more positions and is much more flexible on the market the chart you used to show stack evolution is plainly wrong lamp is still a vastly more popular stack than nodejs you make it seem as if nginx didnt exist in 2010 and ux wasn x27 t a thing then coding websites in html4 with css being interpreted truly differently in different browsers ans when ie support was a must was much more difficult than writing html5 with css3 sweets that are widely supported now i still remember tricks i had to do just to center stuff in a div i think the point isn x27 t that a frontend developer should only ever focus on frontend development but that a person should label themselves according to their specialty full stack developers do exist i am one but you can x27 t expect a full stack developer to match the frontend skills of a frontend developer of equal experience i don x27 t even think the mean stack is mature enough at this point to consider it a good option for most companies angular is going to significantly change can x27 t say most companies need to switch to a nosql database from rdbms can x27 t say that i can even remember very significant breaking changes with the lamp stack and its got a lot of serious organizations using it i agree with your assessment on the authors 30 points fail perhaps a better idea is to not ask people to grade themselves but talk about some of the projects they x27 ve done and their role on it etc if your stack is incredibly simple maybe it makes sense there x27 s no such thing as self-sufficient at any scale sure developers who are adequately skilled at executing business logic crafting database schema writing back-end code writing css writing js machine learning spam filtering batch processing queueing and the tens or hundreds of secondary and tertiary services associated with a large website do exist and you can x27 t afford them there are still only 168 hours in the week and only 40-60 hours in the productive work-week it doesn x27 t matter if your boy knows how to write sql java go js python css and docker configs he still only has after meetings planning and other interrupts optimistically 30 hours of productive time per week so you need biz-logic machine-learning map-reduce back-end and front-end code written every week are you going to hire 5 full-stack developers and tell them to dedicate 6 hours each to each of those tasks for 300,000/year or are you going to hire one of each and tell them to dedicate 30 hours/week to one task each for 150,000/year sql and js knowledge are not mutually exclusive this is not an rpg with skill trees true but time is linear and finite if you spend time learning sql you are not spending time learning js or vice versa you can not feasibly become an expert in every field regardless of your intelligence lack of social commitment and dedication in much the same way that in many rpgs you can max out every skill tree if you play long enough and level high enough it x27 s probably possible to become an expert in all of the things in popular use right now eventually the difference is that in 10 years when you have literally written the book on sql angular aws python3 go css sass and whatever other buzzwords you can think of nobody will care because there will be a whole new set of buzzwords for you to become an expert in a person who can write clean code in php will write clean code in js too js written like php can be a mess while i x27 m able to code backend stuff i wouldn x27 t feel qualified for most backend-only jobs i can do all sorts of web-related work but at the end of the day i don x27 t call what i do full-stack i x27 m a front-end it x27 s what i specialize in and it shows i don x27 t disagree with your premise however the idea of 30 points is fine there x27 s no intrinsic value assigned to those points except that the developer knows the maximum value it x27 s as helpful as any self-rating scheme is which is very little in that it determines what the candidate feels are their strongest skill compared to themselves it x27 s a useless metric when comparing against other developers x27 skills him guy women work in software dev too it would make him or her more self-sufficient female developers aren x27 t mythical creatures they are more common than full-stack developers which is a vague term that gets thrown around all too loosely being a jack of all trades is wonderful if i may say so myself it enables you to give the client a great bundle of services and you know when you need an expert for certain tasks being a generalist also enables you to supervise the expert x27 s work knowing what to ask for and how the final outcome should look like 396k members 720 online jan 25 2009 cake day
