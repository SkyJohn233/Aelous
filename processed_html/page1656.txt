However, a pre-authorisation is placed on your card for              the required deposit amount. In the event that your vehicle cannot              be secured, these funds will be released back onto your card              immediately.

All data is treated as an asset that must be              protected and lots of tools are used (encryption, physical              security, etc.) to protect your personal information against              unauthorized access and disclosure.

They can              also be purchased on arrival when you collect your car. Optional              extras are not included in the price and are payable at the rental              desk in the local currency.<br >               >              <b>When will I receive my refund?< b> >              If you have recently submitted a claim for a refund, please be              patient.
