Deflector Shields - TV Tropes Follow TV Tropes http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields Go To Also called "Force Fields", these are invisible (or, if the budget allows it, barely-visible) energy barriers placed around objects to protect them from harm. Most common around space ships, but also seen around bases and   very occasionally  individual people. How much protection they offer is usually  proportional to their power . This also makes for yet another reason you are boned if the energy runs out. They may also be subject to  Phlebotinum Overload  if they get hit by too many  Energy Weapons . An energy barrier can zap or repel anyone who touches it, or can simply behave like an impenetrable wall. It's often represented in the form of a  Beehive Barrier  or another  Hard Light  construct. In practice, this is somewhat less scientifically feasible than  Energy Weapons , but not by much, at least in the way it is usually depicted   a strong electromagnetic field really can be used to deflect  particle beam  weapons or railgun/coilgun slugs. A better example is the Earth's magnetic field which safeguards us from charged particles in the solar wind. NASA and ESA are actually researching how to reproduce the effect on future interplanetary spaceships, to protect Mars travelers from cosmic radiation. Shields may be handled as a single egg-shell or as several independent barriers covering different areas of the ship. The latter encourages certain maneuvers, such as making sure your shielded side is always facing the enemy. Shields are popular in fiction because it allows the  Cool Ship  to participate in battles without the inconvenience of having to spend the rest of the episode making repairs to physical armor and systems. In older or lower-budget movies and TV, they also eliminate the need to show battle damage on the ship; e.g. having your Ensign call out "Shields down to twenty percent!" can be a lot cheaper than showing a gash blasted in your ship's armor. The downside is that creators often have to resort to  Explosive Instrumentation  to provide combat casualties on a shielded ship. In somewhat-harder science fiction, shields are useful to overcome the seemingly overwhelming attacker's advantage   cities on planets can't dodge, so if there isn't some way to defend against space-launched missiles and kinetic projectiles, wars are going to be short and boring. In  Video Games , deflector shields have a special use. They are effectively a way to justify  regenerating hit points , but only for a part of a unit's health. Shields get to regenerate, but if there is  something beneath them , like armor,  the armor doesn't regenerate . Also, for many games where a target can take  Subsystem Damage , that won't start until you penetrate the deflector shields. Compare and contrast  Containment Field  and  Reinforce Field . See also  Some Kind of Force Field  for the scene where an otherwise-invisible shield is identified by touching it. Preparing to hold off the droid army, the gungans set up a large shield that protects them from blasterfire, unfortunately it won't protect them from the droids that march in.
