cuba offers to pay off debt to czech republic in rum world news the guardian afp in prague fri 16 dec 2016 13.13 est last modified on fri 16 dec 2016 13.38 est cash-strapped cuba has offered to pay its old debt to the czech republic with goods it can spare including its coveted rum according to the czech finance ministry the cuban party as a possible solution presented a list of commodities … including several brands of rum the ministry said in a statement on friday czech media put the cuban debt at about 7bn koruna 270m but the ministry said it had yet to tally the total sum as talks on the repayment had only started late last year the debt is largely the legacy of business ties between cuba and czechoslovakia which split into the czech republic and slovakia in 1993 four years after shedding four decades of communist rule the largest czech broadsheet daily dnes quoted the deputy finance minister lenka dupakova as saying debt repayment in cuban rum was an interesting option these are relatively unknown brands which might be good but we would have to advertise them and generally launch them into the market she added the daily said the czech republic – a country with the highest per capita beer consumption in the world – had imported 892 tonnes of cuban rum worth 53m koruna 2m in 2015 if the entire debt were repaid in rum the czechs would have enough rum for 130 years at this pace but the ministry is against such a solution the czech side believes that at least part of the debt should be dealt in cash it said … in the coming year and the results will define the country for a generation these are perilous times over the last three years much of what the guardian holds dear has been threatened – democracy civility truth this us administration is establishing new norms of behaviour anger and cruelty disfigure public discourse and lying is commonplace truth is being chased away but with your help we can continue to put it center stage it will be defining year and we re asking for your help as we prepare for 2020 rampant disinformation partisan news sources and social media s tsunami of fake news is no basis on which to inform the american public in 2020 the need for a robust independent press has never been greater and with your help we can continue to provide fact-based reporting that offers public scrutiny and oversight we are also committed to keeping our journalism open and accessible to everyone and with your help we can keep it that way. america is at a tipping point finely balanced between truth and lies hope and hate civility and nastiness many vital aspects of american public life are in play – the supreme court abortion rights climate policy wealth inequality big tech and much more the stakes could hardly be higher as that choice nears the guardian as it has done for 200 years and with your continued support will continue to argue for the values we hold dear – facts science diversity equality and fairness. – us editor john mulholland on the occasion of its 100th birthday in 1921 the editor of the guardian said perhaps the chief virtue of a newspaper is its independence it should have a soul of its own. that is more true than ever freed from the influence of an owner or shareholders the guardian s robust independence is our unique driving force and guiding principle we also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the guardian in 2019 you provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do we hope to surpass our goal by early january every contribution big or small will help

having none of it how much did you owe the czech republic try offering rum instead of bacardi next time bacardi shudder the fuck does 270m of rum look like and why aren t i in cuba it looks like twice as much as £270m and its my best friend sorry can t pass by the maths here without asking 4/5ths of it surely if you go by the conversion rate i hate myself a little for this 270m twice as much as £270m brexit gone that bad oh come on they re quite clearly havana laugh i dunno seems like it will lead to rumpant inflation might help to gin up the account deficit tho you guys are kraken me up paaaaaaarrrrtttaaayyy done and done sounds like a rum deal a new meaning for communist party they could throw in a few cigars as well that is not as stupid as it sounds if at below wholesale price the czechs could become a sole distributor for cuban cigars in europe until the debt is repaid and then have first refusal on continuing this is where businessmen could work a very good deal although i don t know of any successful businessmen that are running or will be running early next year any countries damn talk about paying your debts in full that s the spirit as a czech citizen and rum being my favourite spirit i say bring it it will go all to zeman totally sign in or create your guardian account to recommend a comment before you post we d like to thank you for joining the debate we re
