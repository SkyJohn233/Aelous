mongodb how to find string in multiple fields stack overflow by using our site you acknowledge that you have read and understand our cookie policy privacy policy and our terms of service using pymongo for this scenario i have user that has email first_name last_name i am using this pymongo snippet this example works if i want to find searchstring in now i need to also find searchstring in first_name last_name combined how can i do that is there a way in mongo through the query to combine the two into a fullname then search the fullname easiest way is to add an array field and populate it with all of the variants that you want to search on index that array field that way you only need one index and your search across all fields is simple and does n't change when you want to search on some new search variant you can also normalize the text you put into the search array for example lower casing it removing punctuation etc see https //stackoverflow.com/q/8206188/224370 edit mongodb 's documentation now covers keyword search and the new full-text search feature i had the same problem i already used regex string search so my solution was generate a helper collection here i combine all relevant string like i then use a regexp to creat what i allow to be looked for this then also gives some flexibility about the order searching is not the fastest since it still uses regex on all elements but it is ok for me i also index the collection on search_field getting results also becomes a nested call since first you need to get the _ids you really want and then you can query for them like so this is edited code.. perhaps there is a syntax error generally it is working for me click here to upload your image max 2 mib cancel and add another image you can also provide a link from the web log in by clicking post your answer you agree to our terms of service privacy policy and cookie policy 2019 stack exchange inc
