The information on housing, people, culture, employment and education that is displayed about Le Froy Gardens, East Kilbride, Glasgow, Scotland, G75 8BL is based on the last census performed in the UK in 2011.                                    They are performed once every 10 years.                                     Please note: census information may include figures for adjacent streets and postcodes.                                     The figures are therefore representative of the local area, not a specific street address or row of houses.                                    The census collection is designed so that each group of postcodes should contain at least 100 people (50 in Scotland).                                    This is done to preserve the anonymity of the people in that area, as some postcodes cover a very small area, sometimes a single building.                                        You can see the area covered by the census statistics by clicking "Show Census Area Covered" below the map above.
