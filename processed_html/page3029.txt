Microderm | Soulmate Skin Bio-Brasion TRINITY   powerful diamond tip wet/dry microdermabrasion meets vacuum massage and intense hydration to provide a gentle and effective exfoliation.  Great for all skin types, this quick, minimally-invasive procedure improves the texture and smoothness of the skin, as well as promotes the production of fresh collagen and regeneration of new cells. Microdermabrasion treatments can be used to address a wide range of skin issues including wrinkles, fine lines, sun damage, flaking skin, enlarged pores, acne scars, blackheads, hyperpigmentation, dry skin, age spots, and even mild cases of Rosacea. It is not painful, and the sensation can be likened to that of being licked by a cat. Microdermabrasion resurfacing REQUIRES minimal sun exposure for the first 48 hours following treatment. You will need to use sun block with a minimum 30-SPF, and wear a hat that provides full-face coverage. The sun will intensify any scars or dark spots, driving them deeper into the skin. This is key! Improve the texture of your skin and promote the production of collagen using light vacuum pressure that lifts skin to the diamond tip and provides an effective yet gentle exfoliation. For optimal results, an initial series of 6 treatments every 10-14 days followed by maintenance sessions every 6-8 weeks is recommended. Limited sun exposure for the first 48 hours is IMPERATIVE! $95 / 45 MIN $510 / Prepaid series of 6 (save $60) All series must be used on a once a week or twice a month basis. $125 / 60 MIN $670 / Prepaid series of 6 (save $80) All series must be used on a once a week or twice a month basis.
