Watts Founded in 1874 by Joseph Watts, Watts Regulator Company, as we were originally known,made its reputation by "Setting The Standard in Valve Technology." During its early days, Watts manufactured pressure reducing valves to regulate steam and relief valves to ensure safe operation of water heaters and boilers.In the 1900’s, Watts introduced the revolutionary combination temperature and pressure (T ) relief valve, a protection device for use on hot water supply tank systems. These T  valves prevented dangerous hot water heater explosions and continue to be an integral part of today’s water heating systems. In the 1970’s, Watts was instrumental in the promotion of backflow prevention devices to prevent the backward flow of contaminated water from entering into the potable water supply. Watts continues to lead the backflow prevention market today.
