will kimura and aoki become champions hajimenoippo this is something i x27 ve been wondering about for awhile now and i x27 m not sure if this will happen at least not to kimura they x27 ve been building to aoki v. iga ii and we know that at least that match will happen with the small possibility of aoki winning but it seems like kimura is just lost and has been for awhile i x27 d love it if both of them won a belt but right now the only one of the two of them i could see as champion is aoki he x27 s got a set goal and a new found drive to keep fighting while kimura barely has a reason to keep boxing struggles with weight control and doesn x27 t even try to win anymore unless kimura finds a legitimate reason to actually try and fight for the title i think mori should retire him it sucks because he x27 s such a skilled fighter as seen in the mashiba fight years ago and the that he fought a national champion to a draw on two separate occasions and is a really likable guy but right now he x27 s just kind of useless that being said there x27 s a good chance aoki won x27 t win the belt either he x27 s stepped up his game and is taking boxing more seriously now more than ever but he x27 s not a capable enough fighter to take down iga he got destroyed in their last encounter and iga x27 s gotten a lot stronger since then whether either guy wins a belt though is still up in the air but i think we can all agree they probably should have held the belt by now the common belief is that aoki will be retired by iga and that will lead to kimura moving up a weight class to avenge him it was stated on a few occasions that kimura has been fighting below his natural weight anyway and that is what has been holding him back from his full potential i x27 ve read this theory before but i x27 m really on the fence about it i do believe it makes a lot of sense story wise but it does have some flaws regarding kimura he basically acknowledged that aoki chose iga to retire him and flat out stated that he x27 d stick with him until then if that x27 s how kimura truly feels then there x27 s really no reason for him to move up after apki does retire that being said if aoki does somehow win against iga i don x27 t really know where he x27 d go from there but this may be me talking nonsense and kimura may move up if aoki gets serious injured against iga it x27 s a possibility aoki x27 s eos fight is probably gon na be against iga i think he x27 s gon na win just so maron can lose kimura on the other hand seems like a mystery especially with the recent introduction of the regular he may be kimura x27 s eos fight atleast that x27 s the feeling i am getting from him trying to cheer kimura up they probably know eachother i would personaly love to see both kimura and aoki become champions and retire but i am also ready for both of them to just retire without getting the belt i feel like the opposite is gon na happen while kimura has been sort of lost as of late i feel like he is gon na bounce back and aoki is going to be the one to retire b/c of them hyping him up while i x27 d love it if they both got belts i feel more like one of them is gon na be forced into retirement and that x27 s going to push the other to steel their resolve more if kimura could fight in his natural class lightweight yes he could which is probably going to happen after iga retires aoki i think it was miyata himself who said kimura x27 s abilities are beyond the national level as for aoki everyone on this subreddit has a better chance of getting the title both are generally treated as joke characters in the majority of the fights heck half their fights are skipped over and just the final punch shown with some exceptions and serious matches here and there they also have a pretty bad win-loss record it even got pointed out that aoki ended deadlast in his first a-tournament so i doubt either will ever get a belt there is also the fact that most of the aokimaru vs takamaru jokes stem from him calling them losers and mocking them i doubt that running gag will ever be abandoned not to mention their gym ending up with 3 regional and 7 worldtitle belts spread out over 5 fighters in the end if everyone achieved their goals would be a bit ridiculous especially when kimura and aoki have always been portrayed as the average members of the gym the thing about both these characters is that at the end of the day there the only realistic boxers in a manga full of op characters they x27 re supposed to represent the average joe struggling to compete in a field they love even though there just average i always see people complaining about how there just comic relief but honestly their matches are more sad then any thing and who cant relate in every field art science business etc sometimes it doesn x27 t matter how much you love something sometimes your just average and in an interview segments/extra a fan asked george to pls let kimura win a match and he said no hes weak i dont see them winning any belts and thats how life is sometimes 17.8k members 185 online mar 22 2012 cake day
