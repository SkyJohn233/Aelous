review of the reviews grace dent has a glorious dinner at leroy but jay rayner has a torrid time at birnham brasserie harden s grace dent leroy grace dent in the guardian awarded leroy the reincarnation of shoreditch s ellory rip a solid 27/30 for being a dark noisy naughty wine bar with a pleasing menu where no one can tell that i ve kicked off my shoes regular readers will know that if grace is shoeless she s happy add a dog and a vegan menu and she s all yours despite a very pretty instagram feed filled with pretty shots of fresh mackerel tartare leroy isn t truffling for the star that was awarded at ellory which ms dent heartily approves of who wants to eat dinner surrounded by bores who collect dining anecdotes like they re panini football stickers there s praise too for the staff the team at leroy seem genuinely happy service is joyful and unpushy and the impressive self-assurance of the place very few restaurants hit the ground in a fully formed state proudly sure of what they are and are not but sam kamienko ed thaw and jack lewens have landed in perfect shape lots of choice for vegetarians grace devoured the beetroot and hazelnut salad like a large greedy squirrel and raved about a dish of spiced purple broccoli a rosy-cheeked ramble through an organic allotment before finishing up with your knickers around one leg and eating a bombay bad boy pot noodle i for one am 100 supportive of this type of cooking ellory was good – we all loved ellory – but leroy is much much better jay rayner review jay rayner in the observer continues his tour of scotland with a review of the yearling birnam brasserie at the gleneagles hotel center parcs for rich people it s safe to say he wasn t terribly impressed not least by the eye-watering prices including a £27 tuna nicoise the cheaper all-day option cheaper in the way knightsbridge is cheaper than monaco he added the food is a weird mixture of adequate good and what were they thinking generally the menu draws on the french brasserie tradition by way of golf clubhouse i m not suggesting you should actually eat there the main draw is the people-watching happily i m here to do that for you it s hilarious jay was most disappointed by the cassoulet only offered once a week which he presumed means there s time to give this classic dish the attention it deserves sadly for him when it arrived at the bottom are white beans in a violent tomato sauce that hates me the belly the sausage and the duck confit have been plonked on top breadcrumbs are represented by a piece of garlic baguette it s a £23 travesty the one high note service is of course perfect young waiters march on through the oddness of it all as if it makes total sense sophie heawood cornerstone guest reviewing in the evening standard this week was sophie heawood who reviewed hackney newcomer cornerstone 8/10 persuaded into getting the set menu more a cluster of things the chef ex-outlaw s at the capital tom brown liked best that had come in that day she enjoyed oysters so sexy and scallops so fresh that you can almost taste their muscle memory of swimming there were thoughtful small sweet sharing plates including a cuttlefish stew she was still thinking about three days later and a cured monkfish that tasted so innocent until my tongue hit the lime pickle which was a total slut cornerstone has upped the ante in hackney wick although sophie wonders if most new visitors will get an uber to the door and never see what makes the wick london s last zone of mild anarchy david sexton regular evening standard reviewer david sexton visited brand-new kyseri **** from the owners of shoreditch s oklava it s another turkish restaurant but no lazy roll-out having quite a different menu from oklava kyseri has an exceptionally open friendly and sociable feel the service is lovely the room happy you just have to share here and the food a revelation of an entirely different level of turkish — or as it may be turkish-inspired — cooking pasta dishes were delectable chef selin kiazim has been said to be taking an ottolenghi-style approach to turkish cooking but her food feels dedicated to a greater authenticity and less wanton invention than that alongside this an enticing and moderately priced list of rarely seen turkish wines he declares it a good place to go altogether kyseri is a treat of the kind that only a restaurant culture as vigorous and varied as london s makes possible michael deacon blackbird micheal deacon s telegraph review of the blackbird in bagnor was disturbed by the whooshing of the newbury bypass slicing through the berkshire landscape just a few hundred yards away he liked his environs the blackbird is a pub dating back to the 17th century but after a revamp last autumn it s now primarily a restaurant for the most part it still looks pleasantly pubby and old-fashioned though a bar with a range of local ales toby jugs on the windowsill paintings of dogs an elderly-looking stove a vast framed map of india from the days when it was still in the empire he also enjoyed the food of his starter i had the scallops with pink grapefruit sesame and coriander served in a shell-shaped dish on a bed of salt it was a very small helping but what there was of it offered nice combinations of flavour and texture juicy sour slippery soft and his main i went for the lamb which was gorgeous and came with potatoes roasted in beef dripping plus the most enormous yorkshire pudding but deacon didn t think much of the gravy which was too thin or the fact he could hear cars on the bypass two other reviews in the telegraph included a disappointing trip down memory lane for kathryn flett at mr white s chop house not so much mpw-branded as mpw-themed and as such it is pointless not to mention overpriced and badly run meanwhile keith miller gave us a grammar lesson at oddly named west hampstead newcomer ham ham s actual name isn t ham it s hām and no there s no ham on the menu however you pronounce it ham is a by-the-book brit brasserie for the late 2010s where dinner was pretty good if somehow eluded by greatness it ought to do well and deserves to even if the cooking s not flawless it s done with verve and originality tom parker bowles scully tom parker bowles in the daily mail continues the culinary highs he experienced last week at noma with a four-star visit to fantastic scully a small bowl of chickpeas was one of those dishes that belt the words clean out of one s gob transforming dumbstruck awed silence into the broadest of silly grins ex-nopi chef ramael scully is declared a pulsing raw talent with a palate paved in gold i can t wait to eat more of his food tpb can t love the location however in the desolate st james s market the culinary equivalent of dredd s cursed earth he has to get out before it s too late the food may be fantastic but this place will devour your soul already registered login we use cookies to personalise
