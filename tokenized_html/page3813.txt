the 20 best concerts in seattle this week september 12-18 2016 things to do the stranger juliette lewis with guests no juliette lewis will probably never get as good as she got singing pj harvey in strange days and she got a lot of help from the pj harvey side of that equation i watched some concert footage of lewis—from youtube sadly out-of-synch so you have to choose between communing with the visual or the audio visually speaking she s got the strut down the crowd exhortations the bounce the jump the lunge and musically speaking she rocks hard enough and in a venue with a roof and walls the energy should slam off the walls back toward the center someone should get her out of scientology though andrew hamlin bomba estéreo bomba estéreo hail from colombia s capital bogatá and in general manifest the necessary tropes for electronic dance music chanted sometimes distorted vocals more fun with the pitch bender regimented drum computers snapping to attention at the end of phrases bouncy beats sounds like somebody s dropped a guitar in a vat of vegetable oil chimes echoes whistles and of course the bass drop i regret that i can not understand most of the lyrics some of it s in english but liliana saumet s singing sounds passionate even when it sounds like it s being recorded by a recorder in the next room over shades of exile on main st the male singer simón mejía sounds like he s having a hell of a time at his own karaoke party andrew hamlin savage master with substratum the majority of metal released in 2016 fits into the black death or thrash category and typically features a vocalist barking indecipherable lyrics into a microphone at an ear-blistering level so it s a refreshing treat to hear a band like substratum who alongside skelator are holding it down for classic heavy metal in the northwest if you re more into iron maiden and judas priest than cannibal corpse and obituary this is your jam badass frontwoman amy lee carlson s powerful voice soars over a sound best described as old school throw on your favorite jean jacket and pump your fist to some beer-drinking anthems kevin diers tedeschi trucks band with nicki bluhm and the gramblers twelve-piece tour-de-force tedeschi trucks band joins the power of susan tedeschi and derek trucks with a full crew of award-winning guitarists two belting vocalists dual drummers a three- piece horn section bass and a multi-instrumentalist keyboard player to present themselves as the vanguard of modern roots music atmosphere brother ali dem atlas plain ole bill last word since the late '90s when atmosphere burst out of minneapolis they 've attacked the globe with their emotionally earnest yet street-hardened sound eventually becoming known as hiphop classics within their twenty-year career as a duo charles bradley his extraordinaires with his heartfelt vocals and boundless charisma brooklyn soul singer charles bradley was meant for stardom without luck however talent doesn t always find the audience it deserves so it s fortunate that daptone cofounder gabriel roth encouraged him to hang up the james brown impersonator cape to strike out on his own on his new record changes bradley adapts the al green template r warmed with funk and sanctified by gospel to his unique talents he also has a way with covers like nirvana s stay away and black sabbath s changes where he amplifies the soul buried in the originals if his late-in-life success seems surprising bradley doesn t take it for granted—he plays every show like it s an audition that could make or break his career kathy fennessy earshot jazz stanley cowell trio pianist stanley cowell has been around since the 1960s playing with rahsaan roland kirk sonny rollins clifford jordan stan getz marion brown a devastating criminally underhyped alto man and others cowell brandishes a fist of force in a glove of elegance his right hand roams on long fast lines making merry while his left hand plunks down doubt sadness and restraint sometimes the right hand catches up with the left hand and they must have what my mother calls a come-to-jesus meeting outside those climaxes though the chase still thrills go if you care a jot about living breathing jazz andrew hamlin inga copeland russian-born musician inga copeland crept into public consciousness with the postmodern sampledelic duo hype williams in 2007 their music met at the unlikely nexus between chillwave and bass music causing profound feelings of poignant ambivalence hazed-out covers of doug hream blunt s gentle persuasion and donnie joe emerson s baby reflected their tendency to distance themselves from sincere demonstrations of emotion it was always filter upon filter fake identity upon fake identity creative feint upon creative feint for hype williams since hw split in 2012 copeland aka alina astrova released the 2014 solo album because i m worth it a fittingly enigmatic excursion into cryptic droll songwriting and elliptical abstract electronic music that avoids easy categorization this should be very interesting dave segal studio 4/4 james zabiela studio 4/4 keeps chugging along in tried-and-true techno/house time marking three years of internationally renowned bookings in those styles their run of good taste continues with headliner james zabiela a southampton england dj/producer who s gained notoriety for mixing in breakbeats loops and effects into his house and techno productions besides being an in-demand remixer he s reworked tracks by radiohead orbital luke vibert röyksopp and many others zabiela has shown a keen ear for the dark semi-strange end of the dance-music spectrum without being too alienating that ain t easy to do dave segal xenia rubinos with stas thee boss xenia rubinos wants to punch you in the face with her work she flings power chords slashing drums stringent truths about race relations in america and ruby-red high notes around your throat like a bloodied vine her old-world vocal charm flurries through tales of public indignation and broken promises to raise a swirling eddy representative of the stark intensity of the high feminine if she s even half as powerful live as she is on her latest album black terry cat then we are in for a proper throwdown stas thee boss is one half of the now-defunct but forever important duo theesatisfaction who s been performing solo sets rife with whip-smart razor-sharp summer bummers don t miss these two kim selling bonnie raitt bonnie raitt is a national treasure a boozy beauty who speaks to your late-night karaoke heart s truest desires lonely bonnie tired bonnie lovelorn and tongue-tied bonnie her latest album dig in deep serves up all her sweet spots thumping percussion meets steel-string wailing with her signature vocal rasp and the classic heartsore lyricism of the responsibilities and subsequent fallout of human relationships outside of the eye-rollingly-named track g*psy in me gon na chalk that one up to casual white feminism and her longtime chico s-meets-palm-springs-rodeo-mom style this album shows bonnie s staying power in the light-rock-less-talk genre that s still got some kick to it she remains stronger than many of her contemporaries and all around smoother going down than just about any nora ephron–esque rom-com soundtrack you ll ever meet kim selling drake with future and guests views this year 's new album from everyone 's favorite canadian rapper/singer/songwriter/producer/actor has already broken multiple records—including beating those previously set by both michael jackson and whitney houston for leading the billboard hot 100 and billboard 200 simultaneously for the longest amount of time eight vs. seven weeks do n't miss this chance to see the rapper of the moment along with future and their equally ego'd-up mc crew marduk rotting christ carach angren necronomicon norway s big four of burzum emperor darkthrone and mayhem may not have invented black metal but they are typically given credit for establishing its parameters both in terms of sound and aesthetics but the international influence of founding genre fathers celtic frost hellhammer and venom meant that this supposed golden era of black metal wasn t confined to oslo and bergen sweden s marduk and greece s rotting christ were churning out gnarly albums in the early 1990s that were far more refined and palatable than the work of the more tabloid-famous norwegians decades later marduk and rotting christ continue to put more emphasis on crafting vicious songs rather than falling back on black metal s penchant for peddling controversy instead of culture as evidenced in their most recent albums frontschwein and rituals brian cook the legendary pink dots with orbit service even just looking at the legendary pink dots catalog is daunting try listening to it sometime there s a grateful dead–like discographical bloat to the globe-trotting english-dutch group s 36-year tenure and having a filter or trusted guide would help one locate the peaks or is it all good i don t have the time to find out but what i have heard is sporadically brilliant if you like laid-back pink floydian psych rock cloaked with gothic accouterments main man edward ka-spel s morose mischievous syd barrett–esque vocals and the silverman s creepy gossamer synths the legendary pink dots will have a surplus of material to transport you to whimsical and infernal realms dave segal blink 182 a day to remember all-american rejects relive your adolescent pop-punk dreams by seeing blink 182 minus sweet alien lover and master conspiracy theorist tom delonge with a day to remember and all-american rejects at keyarena del tha funky homosapien richie cunning with dj bad dj poe lucero this is from a review of the best of del tha funkee homosapien the elektra years 2004 it includes most of the best moments from i wish my brother george was here and 1994 follow-up no need for alarm making it valuable for those who have n't been able to track them down however those who have followed del all along should also take note this set also contains a small bounty of b-sides most of which are of some import the package scores bonus points for its informative liner notes not to mention the shout-out to borderline-genius writer kodwo eshun if i have any claim to hiphop history it is that i wrote the liner notes to this collection which contains most not all—del 's work with gorillaz and dan the automator is not included of the best work by one of the greatest west coast rappers ice cube 's cousin no less in the history of the art from del to infinity charles mudede great falls big trughk voycheck pink muscles offstage the great falls guys are some of the nicest dudes in the seattle heavy-rock scene put demian johnston guitar vocals shane mehling bass and phil petrocelli drums onstage however and they reveal their evil intentions a great falls live gig is an awesome limb-flailing display of consolidated aggression the physical embodiment of their explosive grindcore sound more than just big riffs their latest release the fever shed slows and accelerates as a cold-blooded creature would rest before it uncoils to catch prey elongated breakdowns stand next to choppy bursts of distortion the binding factor being the same walking-on-hot-coals catharsis you feel in the audience at their show todd hamm lee scratch perry with dub lounge international and guests i have the new lee scratch perry album it s called must be free it s great it makes no sense even by lee scratch perry standards i ll quit with the exclamation points now he s collaborating with something or someone called spacewave the man says he can read minds but he doesn t know that his own website hasn t been updated since 2010 i m fascinated on each spin at how the new music recognizes the pull of classic therefore expected arpeggios and riffs in electronica then systematically refuses them and throws out subtlety instead no idea if the album will relate to the show at all but perry is 80 catch what you can catch of him while you can andrew hamlin thirdstory lolo harmonizing multi-instrumentalist super cuties thirdstory were on tour with tori kelly earlier this year and will be gracing us with their presence a second time later this september tears for fears get ready for britain s tears for fears to offer heaping portions of 1980s nostalgia at the lush grounds of woodinville s chateau ste michelle few bands better embody the brooding melancholy and paradoxically uplifting choruses as the pop-rock songwriting savants roland orzabal and curt smith their first three platinum-selling lps— the hurting songs from the big chair and the seeds of love —exemplify the sort of fastidiously pretty songcraft and melodramatic lyrical worldview that swells hearts and offers succor to those living in a mad world dave segal sign up for the latest news and to win free tickets to events buy tickets to events around
