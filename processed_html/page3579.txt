Can you legally publish someone &# x27;s number plate in QLD? : brisbane Can a member of the public take photos of number plates parked on road areas and publish/transmit them (FB, email, etc)? I have found this reference useful in the past when decided what I could and couldn &# x27;t photograph while out and about. Street photographerâ€™s rights Not that I &# x27;d want to argue about it, ( " yes officer, sorry officer, just as you say officer, I &# x27;m moving now officer " ) but it &# x27;s useful to have some idea of when you &# x27;re probably in the right. Is there a reason you want to do that? I mean, people do that for personalised plates that are amusing or for people who do shitty parking jobs, but I feel like if you are trying to incite something bad, then they &# x27;ll get the cops on you. Someone at work is taking photos of badly/illegally parked cars, and someone else is having a sookie la la about it. If the person taking the photo is on Public land, then it is all good as the expectation of privacy is gone when you are out in public. That is the gist of the law. Yes. But don &# x27;t be a dick. Number plates are on public display. If it &# x27;s in a public area (not in their driveway) then go for it. Probably ask the police? I see them posted all the time on the  &# x27;Brisbane &# x27;s worst drivers &# x27; type of facebook groups. depends on the use i guess ...i posted some funny ones a few days ago same as a few others ....when it &# x27;s for a laugh it &# x27;s one thing but to single people out and victimize thats when it &# x27;d be noticed. So if this link is correct, how did those people who were having sex in their office building get photographed, published and ultimately fired? Surely the photographer could be prosecuted? In saying that , if a paper were offered that picture, would they claim it was from an unknown source and therefore not liable for prosecution? Parked in a public area? There is no expectation of privacy so can be photographed. >Unless you have access to department of transport records you can&#x27;t use the license plate number for anything. So as long as the person posting them publicly doesn&#x27;t include any personal information I don&#x27;t see any harm.<br >Could possibly be considered harassment if you identify their workplace or other people identify them on facebook, or the intent of posting the pictures on the facebook page is for others to harass them. ...I swear you must work where I work, because there &# x27;s been an influx of emails of badly/illegally parked cars. I just witnessed abuse of a bus driver, the sort they are showing in the ads. I was waiting in West End for the Glider. There were 5 others in the queue. The bus arrives and a guy runs up to the front of the queue and pushes his way in first. He then asks for a ticket to the Valley only to be told it &# x27;s a prepaid service. The guy gets agro and insists on a paper ticket because he forgot his Go card. Driver again explains it &# x27;s a prepaid service and he can &# x27;t issue paper tickets. The guy starts going off, calling the driver  " uncooperative "  and to  " stop being an arsehole " . Then a lovely lady probably in her 70s stands up and tells the guy in the sweetest possible voice  " excuse me, we &# x27;d all like YOU to stop being an arsehole " . He turns Barnaby Joyce Beetroot Red and storms off. Its taken its time but finally it rains, the gutters are overflowing and my downpipes are falling from their position, this is the early Christmas present that I wanted, thank you rain jesus. 90.2k Bin Chickens 590 Swooping Magpies Mar 13, 2009 Cake Day
