Quaid, Mark L. Lester, Michael Luciano, Alfredo Leone, Charles Pati, Stanley Ralph Ross: Movies  &  TV Gold of the Amazon Women is a wild, bikini-clad adventure that makes Tarzan's exploits look like a trip to the zoo. Two explorers searching for gold in the jungles of South America stumble onto hidden treasure of a different sort--a forgotten tribe of wildly attractive Amazon women, including Anita Ekberg as their queen. Donald Pleasence (Halloween) and Bo Svenson (North Dallas Forty) have their hands full when the man-hungry babes invade Manhattan, and the excitement really starts. The steamy jungle is nothing compared to the throbbing city streets--and these women can't get enough!     There's a problem loading this menu right now. Learn more about Amazon Prime.
