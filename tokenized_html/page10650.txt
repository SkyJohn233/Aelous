ban ends at i m not a math expert or anything but twisted fate s stun cd 3 seconds stun duration 2 seconds so when you are 1v1ing tf you get to play the game for 1 second every 2 seconds tf essentially deleting 50 of your game by simply existing so you re 50 useless which basically means that tf makes the game a 4.5 vs 5 if that s not broken then what is we re testing a new feature that gives the option to view discussion comments in chronological order some testers have pointed out situations in which they feel a linear view could be helpful so we d like see how you guys make use of it tf is squishy af i never quite liked tf s point and click frequent stun but he d be quite trash without it lol math aside the starting point is already borked the pick a card s cd is 6 seconds not 3 it only stuns at the highest spell level it starts with 1 second there s also the luck draw aspect due to card rotation making speed drawing in emergencies and quick ganks and stuff like that harder to pull off excuse the pun you also discounted all of the other factors like champ tankiness/squishiness mana cost the need to use other cards red and blue you can see the cards on tf s hand etc too lol math aside the starting point is already borked.the pick a card s cd is 6 seconds not 3.it only stuns at the highest spell level it starts with 1 second.there s also the luck draw aspect due to

excuse the pun you also discounted all of the other factors like champ tankiness/squishiness mana cost etc too.it s 3 with cdr champion:432 worst brad japan na 2 years ago it s 3 with cdr no one starts the game with max cdr even if they literally come in with a full cdr setup in runes or whatever it still isn t that bad because tf has mana issues early game and going full cdr early also means a lack of damage and having potentially wasted stats as they build items lol math aside the starting point is already borked.the pick a card s cd is 6 seconds not 3.it only stuns at the highest spell

if you re quick you can speed draw 2-3 golds a fight roflcoptars na 2 years ago tbh if you re quick you can speed draw 2-3 golds a fight maybe 2 if you re awesome i doubt 3 though unless the fight is a long skirmish or something but then the situation is different there there s also the fact that its actually 3.6s cd at 40 cdr which means its about double the stun duration at the highest possible reduction so your values are kinda a lie and the fact its a single target stun and there s 5 players that can jump your immobile ass in a fight if the stun isn t used just right and the fact that tons of abilities that can nuke or cc him outrange 525 675 for one stun if you get rapidfire cannon reducing his ap so you can just kill his squishy ass if he doesn t burn flash universal rules 📜 boards
