playwright-turned-screenwriter david hare plenty the reader wrote the uncomfortably timely denial it follows that it sometimes feels like a filmed play director mick jackson hbo s temple grandin attempts to invest the proceedings with cinematic allure—diverse locations attractive establishing shots—but the film lives and dies by the dialogue and the performances so it s fortunate that both are strong hare drew from the book history on trial by emory professor deborah lipstadt rachel weisz credible as a queens native about the libel suit self-educated british historian david irving

filmmaker andrea arnold red road fish tank finds the director working with some fairly ludicrous self-imposed hindrances a largely untrained cast shia labeouf at his most methody-bedraggled and a nearly three-hour running time that she makes these all meld together beautifully feels like some kind of weird alchemy really inspired by a new york times article the barely there story follows a texas teen the strikingly confident newcomer sasha lane reduced to dumpster diving to get by after catching the eye of a magnetic lost boy a very good labeouf she joins up with a van full of similarly ragged youths who travel the country selling magazine subscriptions door-to-door andrew wright siff cinema uptown and sundance cinemas 3 bridget jones 's baby bridget jones is a figurehead for the romantic comedy genre—a genre oft-reviled for letting a plot device as simple as finding love carry a film but come on this is something that people both men and women want in our lives bridget jones as both a character and romcom juggernaut shouldn t be faulted for celebrating this pursuit so why should we fault the mostly female public who will line up for this elinor jones pacific place 4 david bowie is the only reason why i m recommending this documentary about the 2013 london exhibition david bowie is is because it is about bowie a british musician and poet who died after experiencing the first 10 days of the year we are now departing bowie was one of the great persons of the world and his music has been baked into the global mind we will never stop missing him the exhibit was a huge success and revealed many little details about this mortal man and his eternal art charles mudede siff film center 5 dekalog dekalog is a critically-acclaimed ten-part polish tv drama series directed by krzysztof kieślowski and inspired by the ten commandments the numbers of the commandments and of the episodes do n't line up neatly but you should still expect plenty of symbolism and religious commentary on thursday watch parts five and six seven and eight and nine and ten siff cinema uptown thursday-sunday 6 do n't think twice the premise for mike birbiglia s new film—a follow-up to his 2012 debut sleepwalk with me —probably sounds insufferable basically he s gathered sketch-comedy performers from ifc comedy central and netflix for a film about a new york improv troupe watch them succeed watch them fail watch them fall in and out of love and that s exactly what happens if the film isn t especially funny—the curse of most comedies about comedy—i m not sure that was birbiglia s intention mostly it s like a lo-fi cover of morrissey s we hate it when our friends become successful. kind of whiny kind of mean and kind of true kathy fennessy sundance cinemas 7 hunt for the wilderpeople sure hunt for the wilderpeople s scope is small but it gives you everything you could want from a movie it s smart emotional and even a bit action-packed once ricky and hec embark on an unplanned adventure in the forest but most of all it s funny so so funny wilderpeople is a hugely loveable movie that s suitable for date night or the whole family and i know that sounds like a hacky movie poster blurb but when a movie s this good it s tough to avoid clichés so i ll leave you with another don t miss it ned lannamann varsity theatre 8 kubo and the two strings set in ancient japan the fantasy film kubo and the two strings directed by travis knight who was the lead animator for coraline doesn t just open on a note of despair it lingers there the early scenes—in which kubo the protagonist takes care of his injured confused mother feeding her and putting her to bed—don t serve as narrative contrast instead the melancholy convincingly follows him throughout the movie and death is its central theme while the gloomy thoughtful premise will certainly appeal to adults searching for realism kids will also appreciate the film s frankness and emotional honesty even more than that they will be entranced with kubo s brand of magic go watch kubo and the two strings now for its expensive and gorgeous production value and allow yourself to be pleasantly surprised by its complex emotionality julia raban pacific place 9 24th seattle polish film festival don t miss the 24th seattle polish film festival—playing for two weekends at siff cinema uptown—featuring new

used to quickly make clear who someone is or where she lives in kelly reichardt s subtle portrait of four women in montana these drawn-out depictions of rest and work are the meat of the film yes lots of people will be bored in the theater even though the plot eventually delivers hostage negotiations prison visits and illicit lesbian crushes but the gorgeous impressively empty landscape makes every small face that appears beneath it seem interesting and important julia raban siff cinema egyptian 18 do not resist men in camouflage carrying assault rifles looking on as a group of teenagers march

korea or bahrain this is america and its police forces as shown in the chilling and superb new documentary do not resist ansel herz northwest film forum saturday only 19 black dynamite what is right with black dynamite also happens to be what is wrong with it meaning all you can give this movie is praise—praise for the editing of its action sequences for its competent acting for the director 's knowledge of the blaxploitation tradition and for its groovy score the film begins with a quest for praise and ends by finding lots of it but what one wants from a movie of this kind a movie about a type or period of cinema is for it to cross the border of being merely entertaining order to being a work of genius disorder this i think is the hidden or even silent failure of black dynamite —it is a comedy that never reaches the strange regions of the cosmic charles mudede scarecrow video 20 kwaidan based on ghost stories collected by one of the 19th century s oddest americans patrick lafcadio hearn he turned japanese at the end of his life kwaidan which was released in 1965 and which means strange stories is one of the most beautiful films ever made it also has a soundtrack whose

mccrory siff film center 24 scarecrow video weirdo horror triple feature catch a trio of not yet announced '70s-'90s wildly weird horror oddities from scarecrow 's library grand illusion continuing runs 25 deepwater horizon the players in disaster movies often seem simply like chess pieces on a board that 's about to be kicked over and then set on fire and then thrown into a volcano but that 's not the case here kurt russell and mark wahlberg are old pros at playing affable everymen thrust into improbably violent scenarios and the rest of the cast feels similarly grounded berg knows when to sit back and let the slice-of-life stuff play out and that makes up the first half of deepwater horizon ben coleman 26 the girl on the train just so we re clear this movie is not gone girl it gets off to a deceptively boring beginning and middle with plenty of blue-tinted shots of a listless blunt as rachel an unemployed alcoholic who fake-commutes on metro north to new york where she drinks vodka out of one of those water bottles with a built-in straw and sketches statues on the way home to get blackout drunk rachel likes to watch a woman who lives in a house near the train and regularly hangs out on a deck wearing underwear and looking sad that s not really a creepy thing in and of itself i guess—what is public transit in a big city for if not imagining the lives of other people —but then that woman gets murdered and rachel becomes concerned she may have killed her in a blackout megan burbank 27 hell or high water leave it to a scot to deliver the next great american western it s possible director david mackenzie starred up had the distance and perspective to depict hell or high water s depressed west texas towns and dust-dry plains with unvarnished truth maybe he recognized from across the pond a universal struggle in the specific plight of brothers toby and tanner howard chris pine and ben foster as they try to hang on to their father s ranch perhaps he sensed the timeliness of a story that depicts white american men running out of time money and land more likely mackenzie had taylor sheridan s sicario superb script to navigate a path around the obvious men-with-guns clichés that make up hell or high water s western-noir milieu whatever the case may be it s resulted in a great film ned lannamann 28 the magnificent seven to its credit this third magnificent seven does n't try to ape either akira kurosawa or the 1960 film this is an all-out antoine fuqua production with the director doing a solid job transporting his fast-cut action to the old west if one thing can be said of this seven in comparison to previous iterations it 's that this one definitely has the most explosions it also has the best cast if there 's a way to make a movie starring denzel washington chris pratt ethan hawke vincent d'onofrio peter sarsgaard and byung-hun lee and not have it be super fun to watch scientists have yet to discover it erik henriksen 29 sully the story of us airways flight 1549—which in 2009 pilot chesley sully sullenberger famously landed on the hudson river—was going to be made into a movie whether we wanted it or not so the news that clint eastwood nowadays a dimmed decidedly disappointing figure was going to direct was neither surprising nor exciting i 'm a bit relieved then to tell you that sully is a far more successful exercise in both dramatic storytelling and patriotism than eastwood 's 2012 dialogue with a chair ned lannamann sign up for the latest news and to win free tickets to events buy tickets to events
