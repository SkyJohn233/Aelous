when you 're an intermediate learner duolingo it 's often difficult to know what resources to invest in i 've been very happy with this one in the past http //multilingualbychoice.blogspot.com.es/2016/10/hoping-for-fast-progress-with-slow.html hope it 'll work as well for my french as it did for my spanish of course no one resource is going to 'make you fluent a mix of different ones is best including our beloved duolingo here are some free resources that i have used for french in the past le journal en français facile http //savoirs.rfi.fr/fr/apprendre-enseigner/langue-francaise/journal-en-francais-facile français avec pierre http //www.francaisavecpierre.com/ france bienvenue https //francebienvenue1.wordpress.com/ l'avie de marie balades podcasts http //www.podclub.ch/sendungen/l-avis-de-marie-f there 's also a lot of content on http //lingq.com/ that you can grab for free thanks very much for sharing these and for some grammar training i discovered this site http //www.francaisfacile.com/guide/index.php niv=3 great thank you so much it 's true i 'm learning french and i use this one https //nativefrenchspeech.com/en i do n't pay for much things in language learning unless it 's really excellent same here and once you 've made it through the intermediate swamp then there 's not much point in paying for teaching material then you just spend your money on films novels and other stuff to enjoy in the target language thank you for posting this i too have been caught in that terrible wasteland of intermediate learner for a long time i studied french for a year at university so my skills are much higher than my duolingo level suggests but still not stellar i get bored easily with beginner materials and the usual suggestion of reading children 's books but i 'm not quite at a level where i can read grown-up books without it requiring a lot of effort and my listening comprehension is not good i have considered investing in news in slow french before so maybe i 'll take a closer look do you have any other suggested resources for either french or german i really want to get these two languages to a point where i feel comfortable using them and i am willing to throw money at the problem lol thanks hi there i find that the first five books are difficult to get through and then it gets a lot better i never start reading books until i 'm well into intermediate level far too frustrating when you 're still a beginner not a big fan of kid 's books either they just do n't hold my interest for french try https //lingvist.com it 'll reinforce what you 're doing with dl and it 's still free i found it very useful it also teaches a bit of colloquial french the notes are hilarious at times for german maybe this http //www.nachrichtenleicht.de great for learning current affairs vocab when you 're at a stage where mainstream news sites are still a bit too hard to understand also free of charge good luck upwards and onwards thanks so much it 's such a frustrating place to be stuck and i 've been struggling to figure out how to get over this hump i 've been reading nachrichtenleicht.de for a few weeks now and i really like it i especially like that they have audio for the article as well which really helps my listening skills i 'll check out lingvist.com too part of my problem with reading is that i enjoy science fiction but i do n't always trust my comprehension because the situations are so unusual i 'm usually correct even when i doubt myself but i spend more time than i 'd like looking things up in the dictionary i need to find some more casual books to read first but preferably not the usual suggestion to read harry potter translated into french haha thank you again for your helpful suggestions le petit prince is science fiction that book was my biggest problem lol i kept thinking things like why is he asking about drawing a sheep that does n't make sense i must be misunderstanding turns out i understood perfectly the book was just very strange haha i 've never read it in english though so perhaps i will have better luck if i choose something that i can read in both languages then i wo n't doubt myself so much that is cool site for german i 've been always thinking of trying german but i seriously do n't know where to start with this language never studied a language with cases before there 's tons of free material out there and you 've got duolingo so that 's a good place to start good luck
