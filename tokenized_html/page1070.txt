you were who you want to become such as an inspirational character or person then you need to learn that you can not control everything bad things happen and they tend to happen often at this point if you were a stoic or interested in this philosophy i would say you shouldn t worry specially because it isn t in your control what happens to you is not under your control just the way you deal with it

we all have a choice to be happy and to do that we need to want to be happy there are two ways to define a term one way is to go by one s personal feelings for example dictionary of modern chinese defines happiness as experiences and life that soothe one s mind another way is to transcend one s body and be objective my definition for happiness is the state in which one s needs have been satisfied or the state in which one s goals have been achieved. aristotle said that the goal of human existence is the pursuit of happiness substituting my definition for happiness into this statement

feeling you get when you earn a bonus at work and the feeling you get when you give your coat to a poor person when you get a bonus it is a bit different it is a confidence booster an adrenaline

feeling you get when you earn a bonus at work and the feeling you get when you give your coat to a poor person when you get a bonus it is a bit different it is a confidence booster an adrenaline

go to war with each other and we will have nothing left the more you fight and hate the more the world deteriorates however the more you love and respect the better the world will be if you help each other the world will function better for example the app uber you use it to get a ride to a specific location it is a helpful tool and it helps us get to one place to another but cancel the ride fight with the captain and you have caused damage even if you do not see it riders can get low ratings uber can get bad feedback the wish for peace imagine a world where you step out of your apartment it is cold and raining too from one side a person comes to give you their coat another runs in to walk you under their umbrella people you smile at smile back people you do not know ask you to come in for a cup of tea somewhere in the corner of your eye you see two couples holding hands the woman is black the man is white people compliment you for no reason people say sorry for no reason too nobody tells a lie and every one is pure from their heart the harsh truth unfortunately not everyone is like that the world is not full of happiness there are some crazy corrupt grumpy people and depression exists among us you create happiness for yourself my mum it sounds cringey i know but it is so true go out today and just do something special for someone it does not have to be big it could be simple such as making tea for your dad give your brother or sister a call and just say that you love them hold your friend s hand and smile at them let people know that they are special small things today i gave my coat to a poor man yesterday i hugged my depressed friend for 5 minutes straight the day before i made tea for my companies cook why because it is how the world functions words and actions every single word can either make or break a person every single action can either make or destroy a life so speak kindly and do things that bring peace because the world is being pushed into a heap of shit the best way i think is to align your life so that it produces happiness anything else is a hack say if you have a stressful job meditation positive thinking and so forth would not help they might give you pockets of happiness but not a happy life i took a stressful job as an example it could well be you thrive in stress just an example another way to put it is if you want happiness to be the core of your life then work to accommodate it rather than leaving it as an afterthought rather than a way of thinking about happiness there needs to be a clear definition of hapiness the definition i heard is that true happiness is personal integrity meaning to do what you think is right and to be who you are this seems to be the only freedom an individual has this means that happiness is not an emotion but a perspective therefore you can realize that it s okay to feel less than rosy most of the time noone is peachy 24/7 i recommend wisecrack s youtube video is joy the villain its a temporary state of mind which is followed by sadness happy go lucky people who are the happiest prosper and stay lucky than others but happiness is vague personal subjective and depends on the individual experiencing it seek the middle path and not the two extremes i.e happiness and sadness 3,227,918 views 3,241,352 views 3,787 views 215,918 views 2,840 views 8,945 views 130,941 views 1,252 views
