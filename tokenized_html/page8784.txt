f x =g x +5 then on any interval a b the area of the region between the graphs of f and g is yahoo answers if for all real numbers x f x g x 5 then on any interval a b the area of the region between the graphs of f and g is 5 b a the difference between f and g is f-g g+5 -g 5 a constant thus the area is the same as a rectangle length*width b-a *5 more formally integral f-g from a to b integral f from a to b -integral g from a to b integral g+5 from a to b integral g from a to b integral g from a to b integral 5 from a to b integral g from a to b 5* b-a
