of history at virginia tech and founder of the virginia center for civil war studies passed away nov. 2 due to illness at 89 years old overtime is a sports and human interest podcast series hosted by wyatt krueger and kevin didomenico a new episode will be released every two weeks with an interview from an interesting voice in the virginia tech community have you noticed that it s now a good 30 degrees in the morning when you re walking to your 9:05 are you like me and are too stubborn to pull out your parka unless the air is cold enough to freeze the puddles on the sidewalk admittedly that is a very good way to get sick within the 2,600 acres of virginia tech s campus there are 905 student organizations from the bagel club to swine club with some academic a few food-related several cultural and various others there is seemingly a club for anything that may come to mind made up of some of the thousand search salaries of employees from virginia tech and other universities dating back to 2007 college presidents representing several well-respected universities have recently banded together in an attempt to lower the minimum drinking age from 21 to 18 their claim is that current alcohol age-restriction laws actually encourage clandestine binge drinking among underage students as a student who was at one time or another under the age of 21 it is difficult to suppress the still-present miscreant in me who grunts mmmm beer legal at 18 then the mature adult in me reminds the miscreant that i 'm now well over 21 and this wo n't really affect me anymore unlike most arguments between my inner adult and child in this case the child is right to no one 's surprise the well-intentioned group mothers against drunk driving has stepped in and voiced its disagreement with the college presidents who raised the issue madd representatives have also taken it to another level by suggesting under their breath that perhaps the colleges represented including duke dartmouth and virginia institutions hollins washington and lee sweet briar hampden-sydney and randolph macon wo n't enforce current drinking laws and should therefore be avoided by parents of up-and-coming college students according to madd lowering the drinking age will lead to more dui deaths and it cites statistics that indicated lower numbers of dui-related deaths in the time span after the 21 minimum legal drinking age took effect in 1984 they estimate that the mlda of 21 has saved over 25,000 lives so far i 'm not a math major but 1984 was 24 years ago time has an effect on everything the 1984 to 2008 time span has seen two space shuttles destroyed the fall of communism a heisman trophy winner committing two gruesome murders a president who enjoys cigars in a very different way and other events and atrocities that have changed the world as the song goes times have changed times are strange here i come but i ai n't the same if increasing the mlda is what has saved these 25,000-plus lives why does madd cite significantly fewer fatal car crashes since 1984 among the 21 to 24 age group as well raising the legal drinking age has nothing to do with this it is the evolution of events and the climate of the times not more restrictive laws that have lowered these awful statistics pre-1980s if you were busted while driving drunk perhaps very drunk you were just as likely to get a free ride home from the would-be arresting officer your biggest problem was getting a ride back the next day to pick up your car in recent years it does n't matter if your blood alcohol content is .09 or .39 if you 're driving above the limit you are generally arrested and charged with dui thus attaching a nearly unshakeable stigma to yourself that will haunt you long after the difficult and expensive court proceedings are over there are actually people out there most of them just as well-intentioned as those representing madd who have even suggested counting dui as attempted murder clearly there is a seriousness attached to the act of drunk driving that just did not exist back in the day drunk driving is still going to happen no matter what the legal drinking age is because drinking will still occur this is a serious problem that deserves great attention and effort to correct the stigma of dui awaits both the law-spurning idiots and those who make one sincerely accidental mistake of driving after a beer too many and just happen upon a sobriety checkpoint the answer here is to demystify alcohol take the rebellion out of it one thing i remember about my experience is that drinking was more fun before my 21st birthday than after it was rebellious to be 18 or 19 off at college on my own and downing tequila until i puked then downing more i felt mischievous daring and invincible that ended the first time i walked into a bar after turning 21 i still felt sneaky and rebellious when i walked up to the counter and asked for a beer now that my id indicated i was legitimately legal however i was no longer doing anything that could possibly result in trouble i realized this and it changed my perception of alcohol entirely after that point i may as well have been purchasing depends for granny do n't get me wrong i still enjoy the occasional beer or two or six but it no longer carries with it some sort of adrenaline rush the excitement that comes from the cocktail of youth freedom and rebellion the point is lowering the legal drinking age wo n't completely curb underage drinking or drinking and driving what it will do is take away the rebelliousness of the act of drinking at age 18 it will produce a more seasoned young drinker which will translate to a more responsible young drinker to put it another way with a legal drinking age of 18 a 20-year-old will be as mature about alcohol as a 23-year-old currently is if madd representatives think that the legality or lack thereof of drinking when you first set foot on a college campus will actually sway the actions and opinions of those just waiting for their parents to move their stuff in and head back home then perhaps madd reps need a beer or two to clear their minds those youngsters who want to drink will do it whether the legal age is 18 or 21 some will drive some of those will tragically kill others or themselves because of their stupidity but those who get behind the wheel while drunk are not too concerned about the legality of their drinking age anyway so lower the drinking age to 18 better yet maybe lower the drinking age to 16 and raise the driving age to 18 get the alcohol-fueled stupidity out of kids systems before they ever get behind the wheel success an email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup error there was an error
