player ratings as ireland ah what 's the point of it anymore balls.ie ah what 's the point of it all ireland have settled for a third goalless draw in four games this time against denmark in aarhus as their nations league campaign ended in feeble relegation while ireland have stopped conceding goals they have n't looked like scoring from open play in six months the good news is that 2018 is over .the bad news is 2019 portends nothing different to the miserable risible fare we have been subjected to for the last year here are the irish player ratings irish player ratings darren randolph 7 arguably ireland 's best player once again which in spite of another creditable performance says seamus coleman 6 such is ireland 's negativity the wing-backs spend much of the game playing as an extra full-back as a result we saw little of seamus coleman going forward and he was just another mad clogging space between christian eriksen and darren randolph richard keogh 5 extremely lucky to survive an appalling defensive error in the second-half with jorgenson rattling a post shane duffy 6 careless on the ball but that could be said for all of his teammates kevin long 6 long 's use of the ball was poor again frequently slinging the ball up the line what is to blame for his own limitations or the lack of options ahead of him enda stevens 6 stevens did fine and began the game brightly with a slaloming foray into the danish penalty area in the opening couple of minutes that reckless abandoned was soon subsumed by the poverty of his team 's approach however to the point that he was involved in a neat metaphor for his miserable team in the first-half ireland won a throw-in the danish half and stevens trotted over to take he looked ahead of him realised he had no options and shaped to throw it ten yards back to kevin long instead long insisted on taking the throw-in .and he chucked it 30 yards back to shane duffy who then hoofed the ball to a danish player throw-ins are not a way of keeping the ball for this irish team they are a way of killing time before we give the ball back to the opposition cyrus christie 6 christie once again found himself playing on the right of the midfield three and unsurprisingly struggled out of position o'neill 's rationale in the reverse fixture was that christie was there to offer protection for the inexperienced matt doherty at right wing-back seamus coleman was there tonight so evidently o'neill now sees christie as a midfielder on his own merits he may be the only person to think that way robbie brady 5 lasted 65 minutes and was desperately poor his few set-pieces went awry and he was extremely sloppy on the ball one chastening pass out of play in the first-half stands out ireland need more from him jeff hendrick 4 desperately disappointing he was once again shunted around in midfield and this time found himself at the base of a trio in the eh glenn whelan role he was anonymous however owing at least partly to the fact that he frequently hid with richard keogh toiling on the ball in the right-back position in the first half rather than move and offer the angle for a pass hendrick pointed to aiden o'brien and the ball was hoofed long it came back seconds later callum o'dowda 5 played 79 minutes before making way for o'bafemi again he was frustratingly peripheral and was rarely involved in anything good aiden o'brien 6 toiled up front on his own for 65 minutes as the rest of the team sat deep on the edge of their own area even when he did break forward few of his teammates bothered to run with him what was he meant to do callum robinson 7 the preston strikers pace and energy made a difference when he was introduced for brady and helped to haul ireland at least slightly further up the pitch he looks like he can be a good player for ireland in the long-term but desperately needs a couple of teammates closer to him ronan curtis 5 a willing runner but made little impact michael o'bafemi n/a played 11 minutes that will tie him tie ireland for good he made no impact here but he has plenty of talent and promise here 's hoping he delivers on it and we look back on this bleak night as at least featuring one positive balls.ie the buildup ep 19 kevin doyle christmas sports guide 2020 predictions download share soundcloud cookie policy cookie policy manchester city host leicester city in the premier league this weekend both teams need a win to keep up with rampant liverpool how do you see this playing out
