Washington was an All-Star in 1980 for the Trail Blazers and was a two-time All-Defensive pick before his knees and back became too painful and he retired in 1982. In three seasons in Portland, Washington averaged 11.6 points, 9.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.3 blocks and 1.0 steals in 30.0 minutes per game, shooting .556/0-for-4/.633. Washington was an All-American as a senior at American University, where he averaged 20.8 points and 20.4 rebounds per game and was the fifth overall pick by the  Los Angeles Lakers  in the 1973 NBA Draft. He is most well-known for his devastating punch that severely injured  Houston Rockets  forward  Rudy Tomjanovich  in 1977. While serving a 60-day suspension, he was traded to the  Boston Celtics  in December 1977. Washington was later traded to the Clippers 1978. In November 1987, the Blazers traded his rights to the  Golden State Warriors  in exchange for a third-round pick in 1988 so Washington could attempt a comeback. He was waived in November 1987 after playing in just six games and went back into retirement.

They have reached the postseason 32 times in 46 seasons, including a stretch of 21 straight years from 1983-2003. < \/p>\n Portland has been a playoff team each of the last three seasons, as well. Their longest drought remains the franchise s first six years in existence. < \/p>\n < \/iframe> < \/div>\n Besides beating the  Philadelphia 76ers < \/a> for the NBA championship in 1977, Portland has been to the Finals two other times, losing in five games to the  Detroit Pistons < \/a> in 1990 and in six games to the  Chicago Bulls < \/a> in 1992. < \/p>\n The club has just one 60-win season, going 63-19 in 1990-91 to set a franchise record. The 1971-72 Trail Blazers were a franchise-worst 18-64, with the team losing 61 games in both 1972-73 and 2005-06. < \/p>\n They moved into the new Rose Garden in 1995. The arena was renamed the Moda Center in 2013. < \/p>\n The Blazers have employed 12 general managers, with Glickman the longest serving from the franchise s inception through May 1981. Bob Whitsitt had the job from July 1994 through June 2003 and Bucky Buckwalter held the position from January 1986 through July 1992. < \/p>\n Buckwalter is the only Trail Blazer to earn NBA Executive of the Year honors, winning the award in 1990-91. < \/p>\n < \/iframe> < \/div>\n Current GM Neal Olshey has been on the job since June 2012. < \/p>\n Jack Ramsay is the winningest of the team s 14 coaches, with a record of 453-367 from 1976-86 to go with a 29-30 playoff mark.  Rick Adelman < \/a> < \/strong> coached the Blazers from 1989-94 and was 291-154 in the regular season and 36-33 in the playoffs. < \/p>\n Nate McMillan < \/a> < \/strong>, who had the job from 2005-12, was 266-269 in the regular season and 6-12 in the postseason. < \/p>\n Current coach Terry Stotts is 182-146 in the regular season and 11-16 in the playoffs since he was hired to start the 2012-13 season. < \/p>\n Two Portland coaches have been named NBA Coach of the Year, Mike Schuler in 1986-87 and  Mike Dunleavy < \/a> < \/strong> in 1998-99. < \/p>\n < \/iframe> < \/div>\n The Blazers have held the No. 1 overall pick in the draft four times, but just once in the lottery era. < \/p>\n In 1972, Portland chose  LaRue Martin < \/a> < \/strong> of Loyola of Chicago. In 1974, the Blazers took UCLA s  Bill Walton < \/a> < \/strong>. < \/p>\n They selected  Mychal Thompson < \/a> < \/strong> of Minnesota in 1978 and Ohio State s  Greg Oden < \/a> < \/strong> in 2007. < \/p>\n Portland has selected second twice, fourth once and fifth once, never choosing third. < \/p>\n Here are the 25 best players in the history of the Portland Trail Blazers. Players had to have appeared in 150 games and averaged a minimum of 20 minutes per game for the team to qualify for this list. < \/p>\n Next:  < \/span> Pinball Knew His Limits < \/span> < \/a> < \/div>
