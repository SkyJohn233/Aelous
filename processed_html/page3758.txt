Introducing New Additions to ProSafe Advanced Smart Switch Family: GS724TR and GS748TR (ProSafe 24 and 48-port Gigabit Smart Switches with Static Routing) Agenda Product Overview Hardware Interfaces Software Features                     1                 Dell Networking X-Series Ethernet switches Smart web-managed switches Dell Networking X-Series is a family of smart web-managed 1GbE and 10GbE Ethernet switches designed for small and medium businesses (SMBs) that crave enterprise-class network control fused with consumer-like ease. Compact form factors and multiple port configurations • Enterprise-class optimisation and security features • Intuitive and simple operation Small and medium businesses, as well as remote branch office networks  with limited or no local IT support Customers deploying unified communications/ video collaboration, voice  over IP (VoIP) or virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) Customers deploying video surveillance,  wireless access points or other  devices that would benefit from Power over Ethernet (PoE) Limited or no dedicated local IT staff Upgrading aging 100Mb networks Upgrading from unmanaged networks Opening a new office or expanding an existing office Suffering from poor quality of service (QoS) with VoIP, unified  communications (UC) or video streaming Deploying remote network devices without power readily available Revolutionary web GUI for easy setup and everyday use, even with   limited IT experience Beneficial traffic prioritisation for video streaming, unified   communications, and other high priority, latency or bandwidth-  sensitive traffic Power for wireless access points, phones, cameras, compact switches   and other network devices directly from the network using PoE/PoE+   models Low power design for energy-efficient operation and low total cost of   ownership (TCO) Dell Fresh Air capable, for reduced cooling needs Dell Networking Lifetime Limited Warranty Ease of use: A revolutionary web graphical user interface (GUI) allows for easy  setup, streamlined tools, step-by-step wizards and logical menu structures  designed for the way IT managers work.  An intuitive dashboard provides  access to common tasks, alerts, port status and network visualisation from a  single screen. Flexible, compact chassis: Compact eight-port models are available for flexible  surface top, wall or ceiling mount. There are also half-rack-width 18/24-port  models and a 12-port 10GbE model. PoE: Power wireless access points, VoIP phones, security cameras and other  network-powered devices. Dell Networking X1008 can be powered remotely  with PoE.

Maximise your network uptime and network resources by  prioritising network traffic and get actionable monitoring to  quickly and easily resolve issues when something goes  wrong. With more visibility and influence on how the  network is being utilised, you can ensure better QoS where  it is needed. My IT expertise is limited. The X-Series GUI has been designed to deliver advanced  networking capabilities in a simple, intuitive way.  Wizards  and pre-defined port profiles make it easy to set up VoIP,  UC and other network devices where QoS is sensitive to  network performance. Coming soon A revolutionary new GUI provides access to enterprise-class features  in a simple, intuitive way. Dell offers the only smart web-managed 10GbE all-fibre switch in  the industry. (There is no HP 10GbE model and NETGEAR  XS712T is 10GE Base-T.)* Get more options with multiple half-rack-width chassis (X1018P,  X1026P) versus full-rack width from HP and NETGEAR.* Dell Networking X1052P offers more 10x uplink capacity (with  small form-factor pluggable [SFP+]) and 69% more fabric capacity  than HP or NETGEAR.* Dell Networking X1026P delivers more total PoE power for the  price than HP or NETGEAR.* Dell Networking X1008P is the smallest PoE-capable switch  available, less than 50% of HP. (NETGEAR does not have a  comparable model.)* Versus HP Dell X-Series offers a higher maximum operating temperature  (50°C) than HP 1920 (40°C), HP 1910 (45°C) and HP 1810 (40°C)  series switches.* *Based on Dell internal analysis. Base configuration, no external power supplies. U.S. list  pricing taken from Dell.com and pcnation.com as of 2015 February 24.
