try not to think about how many people are watching by remembering everyone is just looking at the clothes on your body anyways—except for maybe a few— and knowing its a lot happing at once music clothes over all scene and vision and that i 'm not alone walking is there anything you have know now that you wish you could have told yourself at the beginning of your career i have always had my own way and idea about things and made decisions for myself i never wanted to follow a trend but growing up modeling at a young age for sure has an effect on you it can skew your vision of yourself because people try and tell you how you should look to succeed you look at yourself in the mirror and this can get in your head you always must remember that this is someone else s vision of you and not who you are when you are young youcan start to believe that you need to be a certain way or look a certain way to work that does not necessarily work anymore people want authenticity— and even though i never really listened to anyone and followed my gut i still made not all truly heather decisions when i was younger but thats just apart of growing up i would say just follow you 're gut and stay true to yourself learn who you are first and do n't try and be anything you 're not to fit in or make others happy stars are born from individuality size matters—if you re talking nails earlier

mood giant like our talons in a world of niche beauty instagram accounts makeup artist neea kurrne is bringing something new to the table with her daring lip art while backpacking in france kuurne realized that her current bartending gig wasn t quite her calling as a self-proclaimed artist obsessed with creating something entirely unique from her own two hands she knew exactly what to do next after returning to her native finland kuurne applied for mua school and the rest is history visit her page and you re guaranteed to spiral into a deep dive of her eye-catching—and sometimes difficult to look at—posts her technical talent is as apparent as her passion but for her it s all just for fun tell us a little bit about yourself and your journey to finding your place in the makeup artist industry i love painting arts and crafts since i was a little kid and in my early twenties i found myself thinking what is something i could do for the rest of my life that involved being creative and art so makeup artist was my choice i graduated from makeup forever academy as the best in my class about 7 years ago i ve been a full time freelancer for over 3 years working mainly with recording artists and commercial shoots as for my creative side since i went to mu school i would always practice on myself copying alex box s pat mcgraths etc and many mores full makeup looks why lips full face was my first choice but then i went for just eyes and lips and then it turned just lips lips are very easy to manipulate with makeup and do very different looks still to this day my instagram is filled with my own lips i do all the looks on myself and it is still a relaxing creative outlet for me some of your creations look like they can be pretty painful to execute does it hurt or are there ever any injuries laughs they sure do but not that bad i think the only time i got bruised was when i used rubber bands—they only hurt when taking them off as they are very tight on your lips but otherwise my lips have been safe what inspires you everything and everyone around me it changes from time to time but nature is my biggest inspiration i do sometimes want to take part on some negative things that are happening in the world through my lipart like abuses mass-shootings environment and plastic surgerys we are such big fans of your instagram page what does your setup look like for shooting looks for posts thank you so much—my station looks like a mess i take the photos with my old canon powershot over 10 years old and a ring light—that 's it when i usually start creating i have one look in mind but then as i sit there and work something else pops into my mind and i end up doing somewhere around two to five different lip art looks has your instagram gotten you any work or is it more of a hobby it has for sure gotten me some work and new amazing contacts i rarely work liparts on anyone else but some rare occasions i say yes however i do want to keep it also just for me as it is my way to relax and be creative the first time i ever did lipart on someone else was in new york when i got to work with christian ferretti and marcus cooper what are some of your favorite lip products of all time as on old mac artist i definitely recommend its clear lipglass not many lipglosses defeat that more brands should but their glosses in tubes also pat mcgrath s glosses are amazing but most of the time i don t ever use lip products on my photos—they change from eyeshadows to eye pencils to brow products what is the industry like here in the states compared to finland finland is a small country so the competition is harsh i would love to work more in the u.s. and i do have some interesting projects in mind for when i get there next time how on earth do you keep your lips so healthy looking it may be hard to believe but i really dont take care of them that much i rarely use lip products on myself and definitely don t use a lot of lip balms on them if my lips get really dry i swipe a little sara happ s lip slip balm—if you haven t tried it get it it s the best as thrilling as it may be to interview an icon it s also a bit nerve-wracking—especially when that icon is

huge glass window front and i saw my own reflection i felt lucky and also because other people always tell me that i m good luck if you were to ever release a perfume what would you call it pink

thing andy warhol would have created you never know. how do you feel about that statement who do i slap for that dave navarro or andy warhol nobody created me i m not a puppet what s your advice for

all the shades of pink in the rainbow what s your proudest moment when i ran for governor of california i influenced so many people they came up to me and were tearful and grateful that i gave them the power to be who they are do you have any prejudices people who aren t nice what is something that most people do n't know about you i don t like people to say you unless they re talking to me so for example this is how it started i was listening to an animal psychiatrist on the radio she was referring to a dog who wasn t well but she was saying when you ca n't even drink water out of your bowl you can t even lick your bone and you can t kiss/lick your master. and i thought i m not a dog what s your favorite fairy tale the angelyne story please confirm that you are at least 18 years old
