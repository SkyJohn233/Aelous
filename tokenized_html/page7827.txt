dark sphere london lgs reviews magictcg hey there i moved to the uk a year ago i was just curious if anyone here frequents dark sphere i had a few questions how is the modern scene there do the scheduled friday events always fire is it a large space unbelievably this is the easiest place to get back to luton from at about midnight if anyone has any other suggestions for places i x27 d love to hear them i don x27 t go to fnm events or constructed in general but i attend prereleases and drafts there it x27 s probably the best and biggest shop in london to go to for events and if any place will have its events fire it x27 s dark sphere from what i hear though modern and standard tend to be quite popular so i don x27 t think you x27 ll have problems there there x27 s an additional benefit in that it contains legion city which is the only physical mtg singles store in central london and they x27 re really nice it can get cramped on days like prereleases but that x27 s only b/c they x27 re so popular i do recommend it only been to darksphere once american studying abroad in london this semester and it was for the aether revolt release there were a large number of people there playing sealed and draft because of the release there were also modern and standard players as well there are a lot of tables and chairs to sit at and play games but because of this it x27 s kinda cramped and you x27 re constantly bumping into people trying to go different directions the store is also right under a train/tube and lines run above the building every 20 minutes or so overall it is a nice place and i plan on going back for fnm and draft events on a regular basis 366k members 3.7k online oct 3 2008 cake day
