it comes to making a great audio ad through recent testing here at pandora we know our brains respond in different ways to ads based on key elements within specific ad creative and we re now gleaning more insight into an optimal complexion of an audio ad as a result. fizzo the new feel good waterpandora s insights lab and studio resonate teams partnered to create a brand from scratch that would give our data science team freedom to test and gain insights into audio trends and some of the questions we hear the most enter fizzo sparkling water the new feel good water sounds good doesn t it in creating product benefits for our fake sparkling water brand fizzo we picked talking points that would lend themselves well to the elements we wanted to test explains miya kanzaki studio resonate s creative lead on the fizzo test like evocative sound design fresh from the mountains the crack of a can opening bubbles and emotional appeal proceeds donated to a charity we utilized our existing creative best practices with the goal of making the spots as appealing and memorable as possible. __how we measured success__in order to measure the differences between each a/b test we implemented the following measurement methodologies __pandora surveys __ pandora surveys is our on-platform proprietary capability that measures ad recall and brand sentiment over the course of two months we ran 7.6 million mobile audio impressions using the fizzo creatives and over 20,000 survey responses across all of the distinct fizzo audience segments no one listener heard more than one variation of a fizzo audio ad.- __veritonic __ veritonic specializes in testing audio creative to get qualitative and quantitative responses such as feelings and emotions in real time in addition to ad recall and purchase intent. the results__brand placement__which makes more of an impact mentioning the fizzo name in the first three seconds or last three seconds of an audio spot turns out mentioning a brand name within the first three seconds creates greater ad recall than the mention in the last few seconds.1 *what this means for marketers*- the first few seconds of an audio ad really matter use this time wisely to introduce your brand offer or capture a listener s attention in a creative way consider short-form audio we ve seen through many experiments that if you can get your message across in less time then do so if a listener s attention is greatest in the first few seconds short-form audio may be all that your brand needs.__music genre__does matching a music bed with a listener s music genre perform better we targeted country genre listeners and tested a music bed that has a country twangy music bed compared to our control spot which performed better the control spot that kept its pop music brand alignment ad recall was 22 points below the control spot,1 and brand messaging was five points below control.2 *what this means for marketers*- keep the music bed authentic to the brand if you have rich audience insights to inform your decision to customize the music bed per the listener s genre consider adjusting the entire tone and feel of the creative for consistent alignment.__feel good emotions__do audio ads that put users in a good mood resonate more in a recent ipg study we found that users are 35 more receptive to ads when they re in a good mood.3 we set out to test how effectiveness changes if an audio ad could put a listener in a positive emotional state not just the listener being in a good mood already our first step was validating that the audio ad does in fact put listeners in a good mood compared to the control spot using veritonic.it did the audio ad drove higher lift in happy and relaxed scores next we found that the ad did resonate more with listeners the good emotions ad scored higher in both ad recall and purchase intent.1 *what this means for marketers*- as marketers we have control over how we want an audience to feel when listening to an ad the creative opportunity to put people in a certain emotion and not just catch people in a mood is a powerful creative tool to leverage.- for brands desiring alignment of their message with an audience s mood check out pandora s music mindsets opportunities for information on pandora s mood score and other mindset-driven strategies.__gender voiceover__how does the gender of a voice make a difference in ad effectiveness last year our studio resonate team embarked on a robust voiceover study including over 200 voice tests and found that both males and females preferred female voiceovers the fizzo test stayed consistent with these results the female voiceover outperformed the male voiceover when it came to ad recall and purchase intent.1 *what this means for marketers*- although we ve seen female voiceovers perform well in our research we ve seen that authenticity is most important when it comes to breaking through with listeners choose a voiceover that is best aligned with your brand and consider testing different ones along the way __brand mentions__what is the optimal number of brand mentions our team created five different audio ads for this test ranging from one brand mention to five within the 30-second audio spot the results did not yield a significant spread in terms of overall score differences so there isn t one magic number to recommend from this test.1,2 the amount of times a brand is mentioned may not have as material of an impact as some other creative factors tested although this is an area we will explore more in future testing *what this means for marketers*- continue to lead your creative strategy with the overall message and story if that requires one or two brand mentions or four or five your audio ad is likely to resonate the most if it s a compelling story and brand product story.__tone__does an ad with more energy and an upbeat tone get better results than a slower paced one it s every marketer s challenge to capture the attention of the elusive millennial and gen z audiences we wondered how energy and pacing play a role in the ability to resonate with these younger demographics our original control audio spot maintained an upbeat energy so we tested it against an ad with a slower paced voiceover read and more mellow music the upbeat fizzo ad outperformed the slower version in ad recall and purchase intent among millennial and gen z listeners.1 *what this means for marketers*- similar to the good emotions ad marketers have control over making listeners feel a certain way especially when it comes to sparking energy try testing tempo and tone humor bubbly conversational etc in your next campaign to optimize toward a tempo and tone that resonates best with your audience. your brain on audioyour brain can do a lot in a short amount of time have you ever stopped to think about what happens in 30 seconds how about in two seconds with diminishing attention spans it s becoming harder to reach consumers this got us wondering how long do brands actually have to capture attention to better understand this we partnered with the university of california san francisco to measure how long it takes for consumers to recognize that they are listening to an audio ad we measured brand recall and recognition for two-second four-second and eight-second ads.the results were pretty surprising it turns out there is significant evidence that listeners can recognize and recall ad content in as short as two seconds this finding suggests that brands may actually have only a few seconds to capture attention before consumers actively choose to tune in or out knowing how important the first few seconds of an audio ad are consider how you are introducing your brand or product optimize those first few seconds in order to capture attention and keep your audience engaged. marketer takeaways 4533 effectiveaudioads r1 graph
