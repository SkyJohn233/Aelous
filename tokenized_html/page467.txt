advertisement international journal of fuzzy systems january 2018 volume 20 issue 1 pp 163–173 cite as data envelopment analysis dea is a linear programming-based methodology to measure the relative performance efficiencies of dmus which produce multiple outputs by consuming multiple inputs the input data and output data can be considered as a linguistic variables characterized by fuzzy numbers so in the present study we extend dea to fuzzy dea fdea in which the input and output data are taken as fuzzy numbers fns in particular triangular fns in this paper we develop two fdea models to measure the left hand and right hand relative performance efficiencies of each dmu using \alpha \alpha -cut approach further we propose a ranking method to rank the dmus based on left hand and right hand efficiencies finally the developed fdea models and proposed ranking models are illustrated with an example and then compared the results with geometric average efficiency index ranking method the proposed model is also experimented with a real-life problem charnes et al 7 developed dea approach to measure the relative performance efficiencies of decision making units dmus and banker et al 5 extended to study returns to scale rts dmus can be any governmental agencies and nonprofitable organizations like hospitals educational institutions banks transportation the relative performance efficiency of dmu is defined as the ratio of its performance efficiency to the largest performance efficiency the relative performance efficiency of a dmu lies in the range 0 1 dea determines the efficient and inefficient dmus and also finds the most efficient dmus and the inefficient dmus for which efficiency improvements are possible dea improves the productivity of the inefficient dmus by reducing inputs and/or increasing outputs dea calculates the efficiency of dmus which have multiple inputs and multiple outputs real-world problems have some input and/or output data which possess some degree of fluctuation or imprecision or uncertainties such as quality of input resources quality of treatment the satisfaction level of patients quality of medicines in health sector the fluctuation can take the form of intervals ordinal relations and fuzzy numbers etc therefore to deal with such type of real-life situations we propose to extend crisp dea to fuzzy dea fdea by making the use of fuzzy numbers in dea fdea models represent real-world applications more realistically than the conventional dea models despotis et al 8 proposed left hand and right hand dea models with imprecise input–output data these models are not suitable for fuzzy data in real-life applications the input–output data fluctuate in this paper we have taken the fluctuation in the form of fuzzy numbers fns particularly triangular fuzzy numbers tfns so we have propose the left and right hand fuzzy dea fdea models using \alpha \alpha -cut the rest of the paper is organized as follows sect 2 presents literature review section 3 presents the preliminary sect 4 presents the proposed fdea models and proposed ranking approach section 5 presents an example and an application of the proposed approach to the health sector conclusions of the study are given in the last section of the paper in this section we will give literature review for fdea and ranking there exist various mathematical programs in dea such as fractional dea program output maximization input oriented and input minimization output oriented sbm dea programs mogha et al 17 proposed a new slack model nsm of dea which directly deals with input and output slacks to assess the efficiency of public sector hospitals of state of uttarakhand india tyagi et al 24 applied dea to determine the performance efficiencies of academic departments of iit roorkee india there are some studies of dea with applications to health care both public and private sector in indian context 17 18 19 20 hollingsworth et al 12 described the economic theory of efficiency and productivity and their measurement in health care using dea and found the potential benefits and problems of measuring efficiency adang and wensing 1 presented the potential discrepancy between long-run and short-run efficiencies of innovative technologies in health care and explored dis-economy of scale in dutch hospitals barnum and walton 6 presented the effect of the conflict between dea and hospital applications and found efficiency indicators that assume nonsubstitutability rather than substitutability akdag et al 3 evaluated the service quality of some turkish hospitals by fuzzy mcdm approach several researches have been done in different areas both from dea and fdea perspective alizadeh et al 4 presented the location–allocation models of fuzzy multi-objective nonlinear programming in fdea and found the solution procedure based on a modification of fuzzy parametric programming fpp and minimum deviation method tsai et al 23 proposed the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp and fuzzy sensitive analysis-based approach to resolve the uncertainty and imprecision of service evaluations during pre-negotiation stages where the comparison judgments of a decision maker are represented as triangular fuzzy numbers tfns dotoli et al 9 developed a novel cross-efficiency fuzzy dea model for evaluating different elements under uncertainty with application to health-care system jahanshahloo et al 13 proposed a slack-based measure sbm model which is employed for evaluation and ranking of all dmus and extended this model to an fdea model for evaluating efficiency and ranking of dmus with fuzzy data kao and liu 14 reduced the crisp dea model into the fuzzy dea model using \alpha \alpha -cut method and expressed performance efficiency as a fuzzy number khodabakhshi et al 15 developed a ranking method to rank all dmus lotfi et al 16 proposed a ranking method by using generalized variance for inputs and outputs wen et al 26 transformed fuzzy model into linear programming with the help of new approach combined with fuzzy simulation and genetic algorithm guo and wu 10 proposed a unique ranking method by using undesirable outputs through new maximal balance index mbi based on the optimal shadow prices adler et al 2 discussed different ranking methods in dea puri and yadav 21 proposed a ranking method for crisp as well as fuzzy numbers for optimistic and pessimistic models and finally proposed a complete ranking method using super-efficiency technique wang et al 25 proposed the geometric average efficiency index to determine the overall performance efficiency and ranking of the dmus in crisp dea this section includes some basic definitions and notions of fuzzy set theory which are required to develop the concept of fdea for handling fuzzy inputs/outputs in real-life problems it includes the definitions of fuzzy set fs fuzzy number fn and triangular fuzzy number tfn dea evaluates the relative performance efficiency of a dmu in a set of homogeneous dmus the relative performance efficiency of a dmu lies in the range 0 1 there exists exactly one x_0\in \mathbb r x_0\in \mathbb r with \mu \tilde a x_0 =1 \mu \tilde a x_0 =1 \mu \tilde a x \mu \tilde a x is a piecewise continuous tfn a b c \alpha \alpha cut the \alpha \alpha -cut of a fuzzy set \tilde a \tilde a is denoted by a_ \alpha a_ \alpha and defined by a_ \alpha =\ x \in x \mu a x \ge \alpha a_ \alpha =\ x \in x \mu a x \ge \alpha where \alpha \in 0,1 \alpha \in 0,1 let us suppose that the performance of a set of n homogeneous dmus dmuj j
