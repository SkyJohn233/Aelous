Harness, which one?   popeyethewelder.com popeyethewelder.com/facebook questions 2012 I like the looks of that arborists one Doc, it looks really solid! Similar ideas to what Rob has taken for his   comfy back, higher legs than the ozone etc. The only noticeable change is the blue webbing at the front is adjustable on Robs (as are the black tabs on the back like that one) so I can have them tight to stop puppet legs in the the buggy  &  stop leg lift, but loosen them (so I m not walking like Quasimodo) when I switch over to a board. I definitely can have a bigger kite when wearing this sort of style though. When I switch to the water (now waist) I m often 2 sizes down now,such is the difference for me.
