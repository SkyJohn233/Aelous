Of this limited edition single are only 200 copies in the world. The song had become popular because of it's use in the 'Moonwalker' movie, (as with 'Leave Me Alone'). The single release of 'Speed Demon' was subsequently cancelled, meaning this is the only release in existence of the 'Speed Demon' single that never was. Housed in a unique picture sleeve, featuring a 'Bad' album artwork pose from Michael. The version on this single is slightly different to the album version. It fade's out a few seconds early and thus avoids the fade-in of 'Liberian Girl' as found on the 'Bad' album. Track list: A:                     1. Speed Demon - 4:01 B:                     1.

There are 2 scents, a Mystique de Michael Jackson a perfume for women and Legend de Michael Jackson a cologne for man. There are also 2 different bottle types. The first set features an excellent quality hologram of Michael, a 3D hologram label. When you turn the bottle Michael smiles at you. These hologram bottles are by far the rarest and most sought after bottle types. The second bottle type features a picture of Michael, with shoulder length hair, white T shirt and black leather jacket. The bottles contain 60 ML or 2.0 US FL.OZ of the scents. The scents were created in Paris by both Michael and well known perfumer, Jon Pierre Sand. Victor Chiam licensed the perfume products but unfortunately died before they were released. The licenses then became embroiled in legal estate problems and the release of the perfumes was delayed. A media launch including TV advertising and promo store posters was prepared and all in place to be launched just days before Michael was falsely accused by the Chandler family. The perfumes were therefore never commercially released and have become sought after collectors items. The boxes ar in black or white, matching the colours of the perfume bottles. The boxes are 5 inches tall, by 3.5 inches wide and 1 inch in depth. The  " Michael Jackson "  signature is on the front of the box in metallic golden colour.

(Live In Japan 1973) [Album] This album was been released on September 12th, 1988 by Motown and taken up in 1973. Where it is been taken up isn't mentioned on the cover, but suspect that it is in Japan, because of the few words which the J5 are telling in the local language. What attract the most is that you can hear only Michael in stereo, his brothers and the music are divided over left and right. It's a nice album, also because you can hear how such a concert of the Jackson 5 was. Concert recorded at the Osaka Koseinenkin Hall, Japan, on April 30th, 1973.
