Jaser Rabadi, a representative of World Meteorological Organization (WMO) West Asia, alerted that even a 5cm increase in sea levels over the next fifty years, is likely to cause major consequences for marine life and coastal developments in Bahrain. Rabadi said that the rate could increase faster than predicted, and alerted that the region may be plagued by natural disasters that have never been experienced before. Rabadi blamed the rapid urbanization, reclamation and playing with nature, as the major contributing factors. The changing weather patterns and rising sea levels may be due to climate changes happening globally and in Bahrain. For instance, sea levels are increasing at the rate of one cm every ten years, thereby threatening the coastline in the next 50 years. At the present rate, a five cm increase in sea levels could spell disaster in next 50 years, Rabadi warned. He noted that the coastal population is at high risk from flooding in future, and the marine life and people depending on marine life for livelihood, will be the most affected, Rabadi said. The stark warning was issued during a workshop on the role of meteorological and hydrological services in minimizing disaster risk. However, Rabadi feels that the extent of GCC disaster may not be up to the scale of the Asian tsunami, which happened towards end of 2004. Rabadi hopes that Bahrain would contribute towards stimulating global efforts to reduce risk of disaster onset, thereby playing a role model for other countries in the region. In the meanwhile, the Civil Aviation Affairs (CAA) Meteorology reports that Bahrain has been experiencing its driest winter in 70 years. The unusually low amount of rainfall and higher than average temperatures indicate that there has been no winter this year. The Assistant Under-Secretary at CAA, Abdul Majeed Isa, termed the current situation as very “abnormal”, and urged the world leaders to take action for lowering the risk potential environment catastrophe in future.
