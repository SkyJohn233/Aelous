unblocked games how to block google sites i ve been asked to block games for some student accounts which i ve been able to achieve through the games category in filter actions and adding a few individual domains what i haven t been able to block are some unblocked games sites especially ones that are on google sites web sites if someone could tell me how if it s possible to block specific google sites web sites i would be grateful i prefer to encourage students to use their time wisely of their own accord but i ve been asked to do what i can to make game sites unavailable thanks steve

13 dec 2017 1:13 pm trying here to block https //sites.google.com/site/subgfyfs/ and not having much luck tried entering this exact url in the blacklist for a profile but it s not working policy helpdesk says that request url https //sites.google.com/site/subgfyfs/ result allowed url category personal pages url reputation neutral filter profile elementary students policy name base profile i tried denying access to personal pages in the elementary students but it still goes through base profile has the site blacklisted i m at a loss in reply to vincentvanier vincent please read the post just above yours cheers bob in reply to formermember hi and welcome to the utm community please read my post just above vincent s post cheers bob in reply to formermember hi inder and welcome to the utm community please read my post just above vincent s post above no one can help you without more information cheers bob in reply to balfson in reply to pkbenhtri kjmojong vincent can t even follow vincent s entry still not working for me bob i have no idea how to get information from those logs that s the worst part about this whole product can t find anything from those logs i know the information is probably in there but i have no idea how to get the information out of the logs to share with you in reply to vincentvanier vincent the easiest way is to open webadmin click on web protection and then on the at the top of the page so that you can see the web filtering live log in the filter box put part of the url you want to try and touch enter now try the url that isn t blocked show us the line where your url appears and the url you tried cheers bob in reply to balfson bob i did as you suggested and found that the web filtering live log seems to quit after a short period of time filtering does not work at all for some reason i can type the url into the filter box but the log seems to be outputting whatever it likes in there can t see the url i m trying to filter in the log s output is anyone else having this issue in reply to vincentvanier if you don t see it in the web filtering log at all it s not being handled by web protection what do you learn from doing 1 in rulz cheers bob in reply to formermember in reply to james woakes hi and welcome to the utm community if you are using web filtering in the transparent mode it s possible that chrome and android phones are accessing the server using udp 443 instead of tcp 443 you could create a firewall rule like any udp 443 internet drop to force chrome to use tcp if you are using the proxy in standard mode explicit proxy you can add udp 443 to allowed target services on the misc tab of filtering options in either case you must not select do not proxy https traffic in transparent mode on the https tab of the filtering profile you should now be able to block that url effectively cheers bob we d love to hear about it click here to go to the product suggestion community 1997 2019 sophos
