BASS About Head Teacher                                                             Our Logo and Colours  The logo is in four segments. The first segment is the “Twer Nyame” stool and swords which together signify the traditional authority as stake holders. The holy Bible forms the second, and signifies the collaboration with the (Methodist) church in founding the school. The bible on the stool explains the host role traditional authority plays to the church for mutual co-existence and development. Segment three is solid black shield that background the stool, swords and bible. The shield as weapon of protection, safeguards the bond between the traditional authority and the (Methodist) church fashioned in open arms-ready-to-embrace-all manner and carrying the embossed “Dzin Pa Ye Sen Ahonya” motto held towards the shield and its contents, the banner simultaneously invites and welcomes all prospective stakeholders to come aboard. Black and yellow are school colors. The black signifies “Dzin Pa” – (Ghanaian/African) integrity, while the yellow signifies “Ahonya” – (riches). The two combine to mean that even in riches, one must strive to maintain one’s integrity: for “Dzin Pa Ye Sen Ahonya”. 2018-11-13 15:20:41 2018-11-13 15:14:06 2018-11-13 15:02:31 2018-11-15 2018-11-12 Email: beautiful_bass@yahoo.com Telephone: 0332091765                                         Adress: BREMAN ASIKUMA - CENTRAL REGION
