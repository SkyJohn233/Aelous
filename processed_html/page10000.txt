Biggest Deals 2017: Emerson makes software play, World Point goes private - St. Louis Business Journal Emerson buys oil and gas software firm Emerson in October agreed to acquire Paradigm, a Houston-based company that provides software for the oil and gas industry, for $510 million. The deal was Emerson’s second acquisition that month targeting tech for the oil and gas industry after it bought  GeoFields  Inc. for an undisclosed amount. The Paradigm deal is expected to close this month and will help satisfy a growing need for exploration and production software solutions, according to Emerson Chairman and CEO David Farr . "“Paradigm broadens our leadership in the upstream oil and gas market by adding a range of subsurface software tools that complement our growing Automation Solutions portfolio," he said. Paradigm has more than 500 employees worldwide. The $510 million purchase price represents a multiple of 13 times expected 2017 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), Emerson officials said at the time of the deal announcement. The two software deals followed Emerson’s sale in September of its ClosetMaid business to New York-based Griffon Corp. for $260 million. Farr said at the time that deal was the final step in a strategic portfolio repositioning the company began two years ago. In addition, the restructuring included Emerson’s $1.2 billion sale earlier this year of its motors, drives and electric power generation businesses to Japan’s NidecCorp. The company also sold its Network Power unit for $4 billion to Platinum Equity in a deal that closed late last year.
