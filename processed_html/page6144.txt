I started learning spring framework, and I can't find alternative method to call controller method, I'm passing querystring varialble in url like - /index.htm?do=loginto call controller method named "login" from my controller is there any alternative method than this which url looks like "http://example.com/index.htm" or "http://example.com/index/" what is @requestMapping and how to use it? Many thanks! dispatcher-servlet.xml myController in this code,I always have to pass query string variable to call matching controller method.like  "http://example.com/index.htm?do=login" this will call login method from controller but I don't want to use query string variables. how can I do that?is it possible with  @RequestMapping   to call controller's login method with URL which looks like this :  http://example.com/login " I tried this, but it's not working Not really sure what is your problem, but for starters: The index method will be called for all following URLs: /index.htm  -  doParam  is  null  inside  index()  method /index.htm?do=login  -  doParam  is equal to  login /index.htm?do=logout  -  doParam  is equal to  logout                                 Click here to upload your image                                 (max 2 MiB) Cancel and add another image You can also provide a  link from the web .
