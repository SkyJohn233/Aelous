good vs. it doesn t have good ratings it can t be good comes up i am reminded of shadows of the empire the critics slammed it quite many players slammed it as well albeit to a far smaller degree and nearly two decades later people like teamfourstar have continued slamming it it hasn t aged well and i can t fathom anyone who hasn t played it before buying and liking it.and i don t care i have and will always think positively of this game even though a lot of it is probably based on nostalgia namely how sote was one of the reasons i got interested in games to begin with yes the battle of hoth mission is the best one worth the current price tag of 5bux but back in the day up to the mid-2000s or read more radigram games reviews 1 pur nostalgia may 3 2016 verified owner yes this is one of the games i played almost 20 years ago so this comment will be a bit nostalgic trough pink glasses anyway yes this game is old very old in todays viewpoint it was one of the first real 3d games with low polygon figures and quit low-resolution textures think of games like the first tomb raider drakan and others but the gameplay itself is totally worth it especially if you have a joystick/gamepad you can also play it with a mouse and/or keyboard but in some levels this doesn t work that great or can be frustrating there are of couse some extras in the pc version this one has rendered/animated videos unlike the n64 version that had only static images- the graphics are crisp- fantastic music the gog version has music in 192 kbit/s ogg vorbis read more dutchbastard games reviews 3 red leader may 3 2016 this game was one of the first games i had running on a 3d accelerator back in 1997/1998 i believe it ran quite well on a rendition 2100 chipset the game itself isn t that special except for the first part where you get to fly a snowspeeder and take down at at s with a cable and hook just like in empire strikes back if you got 5 bucks to spare it s worth it just for that part forevertangent games reviews 1 great but a little fast may 3 2016 verified owner this is one of my favorite games of all time in fact i adored the entire shadows of the empire hypermedia event so if you like star wars you will probably enjoy this game.this release everything seem fine for the moment except one small thing this release of the game need cpu throttling at least on my system although playing games in turbo can be entertaining unto itself it can be a little off putting if you don t know why it is happening nshep53 games reviews 2 nostalgia overload may 3 2016 verified owner star wars shadows of the empire originally came out in the early days of the n64 on the 64 the first level was amazing and still is to this day after that people where divided the controls for the n64 version were awful to be completely honest but i still loved the game i always knew there was a pc version with better graphics and rendered cutscenes opposed to the 2d static cutscenes from the original now through the wonders of gog shadows of the empire is here and it is the best it has ever been the graphics look great the rendered cutscenes make the game have a more cinematic feel and the controls are actually good on the pc i love this game one of my favorite star wars games and if you give it a chance i think you will enjoy it too not like it changes anything but we are obligated
