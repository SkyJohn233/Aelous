fishermen saw chau 's body getting buried by the tribals chau was killed with an arrow yadav said that authorities are still trying to recover chau 's body we did an aerial sortie yesterday to assess the situation yadav said the most obvious huddle in recovering chau 's body is the sentinelese fiercely oppose outside contact so much so that once when a helicopter hovered above them to check on their health they shot arrows at it more on that later yadav also said that a strong case has been registered against the fishermen who should not have taken chau there it 's very unfortunate it 's a sensitive tribe living in that area for 60,000 years they should not be contacted yadav said they could be prone to diseases from outside world the coast guard and indian navy carry out patrolling to prevent people from entering the north sentinel island where chau 's body is still lying is home to the sentinelese an indigenous tribe that furiously rejects outside contact the indian law protects the sentinelese people whose number is estimated to be under 50 they famously do not use money they can not be prosecuted and any contact with them or entry into areas inhabited by them is illegal even taking videos of the sentinelese people is prohibited in 2017 the government had clarified that the sentinelese are identified as an aboriginal tribe and that videos showing them can not be uploaded on social media or the internet who are the sentinelese the 2011 census of india counted 15 sentinelese people on the north sentinel island there are 12 men and three women the numbers could be higher since the census was done from a distance according to survival international a global rights group that campaigns for tribal people the sentinelese vigorously reject contact with the outside world so much so that during the 2004 tsunami the sentinelese attempted to shoot arrows at helicopters of the indian coast guard the helicopters flew over the north sentinel island in order to assess the damage the sentinelese may have suffered due to the tsunami the extent of that damage if any still remains unknown according to the survival international the sentinelese killed two indian fishermen who inadvertently landed on the island the fishermen had moored their boat near the island and had slept off but the boat 's anchor rope broke and the boat drifted to the island 's shores the rights group also says that the sentinelese survive by hunting or gathering food the sentinelese are also known to have the ability to build boats and fish in shallow waters the indian government has decided not to make any attempts to contact the sentinelese such attempts were made in the past occasional reconnaissance missions from boats anchored more than an arrow 's throw away are carried out to check whether all is well with the sentinelese with inputs priyamvatha p in chennai and geeta mohan in new delhi read beyond killing of american national sovereign citizens of india read
