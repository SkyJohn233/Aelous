Note that my LLC is not related to real estate. I thought I would use the 401K to invest actively in stocks, however, I have not done so. I am investing in real estate actively though. I would like to invest in more real estate via the current balance in my Solo 401k. After doing some Googling,  seems to be a good option for me A few questions for those who have done this before: I am very close to reaching out to companies that help me legally setup such a 401K. Just a few questions for the Bigger Pockets community before I do so. Thanks! Rotate @Mushfiq S. You can easily shift from what you have to a more flexible self-directed Solo 401(k).   Your  LLC  will sponsor one 401k plan, and the self-directed plan will become a successor plan to your current plan, which will need to be shut down. There are no taxes or penalties for such a move. The new Solo 401(k) can hold both non-traditional assets such as real estate and conventional brokerage assets.  You can be fully and truly diversified with such a plan. Rotate @Mushfiq S. The existing solo 401k can bet restated to a new solo 401k plan that allows for investing in real estate. Also, since E-Trade offers a brokerage account for third-party solo 401k providers, the funds can stay at E-TRADE. This way you can continue investing in equities and also gain the option to invest in real estate. E-Trade will issue a new checkbook for the new solo 401k brokerage account. The form that you will need to fill out with E-Trade is called "Investment Only (Non-Custodial) Retirement Plan Application." There is a box in Section 6 where you check off "Free Check Writing." Rotate @George Blower  thanks.  Is this something I can do myself? Do I need to use your mysolo401k services? If I enable Free Check Writing, does that essentially mean when I am ready to buy a property, I will write a "check" on behalf of the 401k to pay for the property? Sorry just a bit confused on my next steps Rotate @Mushfiq S. Yes you will need to use the services of a solo 401k plan provider. Reason being, it is the solo 401k providers plan documents that allow for investing in real estate. However, E-TRADE will offer the brokerage account that comes with a checkbook.  Rotate ...

Also how 'easy' is to get a non-recourse loan to supplement the 401k funds to purchase a property? Is the approval process much more stringent than a normal loan?  Rotate @Mushfiq S.  A self directed solo 401k provider should be able to help you restate the plan documents and walk you through the transition process. Many investors on BP have gone through the same route so you can search the forum for others with similar experiences. In regards to non-recourse loan, each lender may have their own loan offers and requirements. You can find a list of non-recourse lenders below with some brief information on the type of loans they offer. I would contact each lender to discuss your particular financing needs.  https://www.biggerpockets.com/blogs/2810/50272-list-of-non-recourse-lenders-for-self-directged-ira-and-401k Rotate @Mushfiq S. Good question, and yes it is strongly recommended that you use the services of a solo 401k provider who will assist you in not only drafting the  solo 401k trust  documents but also the E-Trade brokerage forms and the E-Trade internal transfer form for the existing solo 401k. Also, what is good about a solo 401k obtaining a non-recourse loan from  non-recourse lenders , is that it won't subject the solo 401k to UDFI.  Rotate Call quest IRS in Texas. All answers and small fees. I have heard equity trust is so big they are sluggish. These are custodial Ira companies. I have no interest in any custodial company but do provide these companies info to inform and utilize my real estate clients. They explain and train you on the  IRA  / IRS rules.  Rotate @Mushfiq S. As others have mentioned, you can easily transition from an Etrade Solo 401k to a fully self-directed 401k that allows for investment into real estate with checkbook control. I'd venture to say most who are looking to do this will prefer the reduced cost structure and increased control you get with a Solo 401k provider offering checkbook control compared to a custodian setting up and holding the 401k assets.
