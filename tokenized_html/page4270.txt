chavez kevin ng research in theminehan group is primarily focused on the total synthesis of natural productsand the development of new synthetic methods for carbon-carbon bond-formation with an emphasis on the use of environmentally friendly reagents and solventsystems inspiration for the development of these methods comes from thecomplex structures of naturally occurring substances of medicinal andpharmaceutical import we are currently pursuing four main lines ofinvestigation 1 the 3,3 -sigmatropic rearrangement ofaliphatic allyl-alkynyl ethers is a relatively unexplored reaction in organicsynthesis allyl-alkynyl ethers may be generated from allyl-1,1-dichlorovinylethers by treatment with excess n-buli at low temperatures however subjectingallyl-dichlorovinyl ethers to these conditions followed by quenching with analcohol leads to rearranged products in the form of gamma delta-unsaturatedesters sigmatropic rearrangement is occurring rapidly and stereospecificallyat low temperatures in this process mechanistic investigations of thisreaction are underway the proposed ketene intermediate holds great syntheticpromise since it may be intercepted by a wide variety of nucleophiles to forman array of carbonyl compounds in a single step we have recently developedmilder methods for the preparation of alkynyl ethers and have successfullyapplied these methods in the rearrangement process currently we areinvestigating the synthesis and sigmatropic rearrangement propensity of allylalkynyl amines 2+2 cycloaddition reactivity of alkynyl ether-derivedketenes 2 allylindium reagents generatedin-situ from allyl halides and indium metal react with carbonyl compounds inwater to form products containing a new carbon-carbon bond we have prepared aseries of silyl-substituted allylindium reagents that allow multiplecarbon-carbon bonds to be formed in a single step in aqueous media uponreaction with appropriate electrophiles such reagents may be employed in anenvironmentally benign preparation of substituted pyrans and 7- and 8-memberedcarbocycles which are at the core of a variety of biologically-importantnatural products allylic substitution reactions are important and powerfulmethods for carbon-carbon bond-formation environmentally benign organoindiumreagents participate in transition-metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions andallylic substitution reactions wehave reported that 1-acetoxy-2,7- and 2,8-enynes undergo a palladium-catalyzedcyclization substitution reaction in the presence of organoindium reagents toform substituted 5- and 6-membered carbo- and heterocycles we envision thatthis process may be extended to the stereoselective synthesis of fused 6-5 ringsystems found in many natural products 3 c -aryl glycosides are an important class of naturally occurringcompounds with unique chemical and biological properties possessing a carbon-carbon bond between aromatic and carbohydratemoieties these substances are endowed with remarkable stability toward acidand enzymatic hydrolysis this affords them sufficient intracellular lifetimeto allow trafficking to the nucleus where they bind dna to form stablecomplexes indeed numerous members of the glycosyl arene family have been showto possess antibacterial antitumor and antifungal activities we haveembarked on a program directed toward the total synthesis of members of thisfamily of natural products and have developed new methods for their synthesis.in particular we have recently reported an indium allylation/organoindiumcross coupling route to 2-deoxy c -arylribofuranosides and pyranosides furthermore we have accomplished the totalsyntheses of aspalathin nothofagin indole-3-acetonitrile-4-methoxy-2- c -beta-d-glucopyranoside polycarcin v 3,3 -di- o -methylardimerin hortonones a-c andsubamolides d and e 4 weare also assessing the binding affinity and sequence selectivity of c -aryl glycosides for duplex nucleicacids using fluorescence and ultraviolet spectroscopies polycarcin v whichhas an association constant for calf-thymus dna of 1.7 Â±0.1 x 10 6 m -1 has been found to bind at-rich dna with an order of magnitude greater bindingaffinity than gc-rich dna in order to further explore the principles of carbohydrate-dnamolecular recognition we are currently investigating the preparation bis -c-glycoside derivatives ofintercalating chromophores that place carbohydrate moieties in both the majorand minor grooves of dna students in the minehan group gain practical experience in thesynthesis purification and spectroscopic characterization of organicmolecules some examples of the useful skills obtained are 1 techniques for running reactions under inertatmosphere 2 purification of compounds by columnchromatography and radial chromatography 3 analysis of reactions by thin-layer chromatographyand gc-ms 4 structure elucidation of synthetic compounds usingone- and two-dimensional nmr spectroscopy 5 characterization of synthetic compounds by lc-ms ir and uv spectroscopies 6 evaluation and quantitation of smallmolecule-macromolecule binding interactions by uv cd and
