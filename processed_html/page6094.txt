marmaris market thursday - Review of Marmaris Thursday Market, Marmaris, Turkey - TripAdvisor downstairs all veg - ok. upstairs bags, t shirts, belts, etc. Hassle!!! Beats Matalan or Asda...that's all you hear...need to haggle. to crowded and all selling same things, lots of hassle to buy there goods, if you can stand this no problem grab at you and touching my daughters bottom...a no no! you can get cheaper in the shops! didnt like anything about this market, too busy and too hot. Never again stall-holders were very insulting and they were swearing as if it was the language we spoke, they obviously had no concept of what they were saying. 1 stall-holder threatened to cut my 17yr old throat and another pulled a gun out on him. The Police were nowhere in sight. very busy, and very hot,but so much to see, always remember to haggle
