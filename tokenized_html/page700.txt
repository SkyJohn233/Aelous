the four-year animal enforcement officer and her co-workers it can be hard on all of us tucker said we have moments that will stick with us success an email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup error there was an error processing your request receive the top local headlines each weekday she is on a 15-member crew with the humane society of the pikes peak region and she and her colleagues expect their work to increase as warm weather entices more animals and people outside their office provides animal control services to colorado springs fountain monument manitou springs and unincorporated parts of el paso county the top priorities are aggressive dogs animal cruelty and any pet trapped inside a hot car joe stafford director of animal law enforcement with the local humane society said his officers try to respond to priority calls within 14 minutes during daylight about a half-dozen officers are on the street and the one closest to a priority call responds he said the area population of animals and people has continued to grow during his 16 years in the job we certainly can use more people and i think our workload can justify that stafford said our work is related to the population the more people there are the more problems there are it 's similar to regular law enforcement firefighters or any other government services units last year the colorado springs branch received 23,131 calls the most since 2012 say humane society statistics of those 2,458 were animal cruelty investigations calls increase during summer as many people complain about loose pets he said the surge begins in may then slows in september or october during cold months more calls come about pets not being sheltered the work can take a toll on officers stafford said his office has about a 30 percent turnover rate because officers burn out or have trouble handling the challenges such as treating abused or dead animals you ca n't save all of the animals and sometimes unfortunately things happen he said you 'll have to be at peace with that most officers enter the field with an interest in law enforcement stafford said every year his agency holds an academy to teach recruits about the job hundreds of people apply to fill one or two spots he said we lose some great great people stafford said but with the resignations we get a lot of fresh perspective and they try to continue to change and improve our processes so that we can do the best job we can among their unusual calls he recalled officers responding last month to a hotel room where a woman kept 40 animals dogs cats rats and reptiles including a colombian boa constrictor she was asked to give up some of her pets for adoption that 's something you 'd not expect when you get that call stafford said if you did n't know any better you 'd think someone was pranking you officers spend a lot of time explaining to people what they can and ca n't do with their pets if an owner ca n't provide proper care the officers will suggest how to get vaccinations shelters and spaying or neutering the majority of our work is about increasing the level of care for the animals in the community and that results in a lot of education stafford said we 're looking to try to bring the person into compliance with the basic requirements of what the law is that 's why hearing someone say the officers are dog-catchers is like fingernails on a chalkboard to tucker it 's so little of what we do she said we do so much more than that it 'd be a nice break to sit around and catch dogs but none of us do that we do n't have enough time she remembers being threatened by a man accused of breaking a puppy 's leg after it messed with his marijuana but some tasks are mundane during two recent service calls tucker checked on a pug with bad skin to see if the owner had set up a veterinary appointment the owner said the pug would go in for a checkup in a few days the other complaint involved a report of a possibly unhealthy pitbull in front of a fountain home at one point she contemplated the purpose of her work if we do n't do it who will she asked reporter chhun sun is a sports reporter with an
