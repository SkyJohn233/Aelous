(Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images) This offseason,  Kirk Cousins  lost his top two receivers. Pierre Garcon left the team to go join Kyle Shanahan in San Francisco. DeSean Jackson opted to go to Tampa Bay to play with young franchise quarterback Jameis Winston. Suddenly, Cousins had to replace his production. There was a lot of buzz that free agent addition  Terrelle Pryor  could help them get the job done. After all, the 6-foot-6 converted quarterback was coming off the best season of his career with the Cleveland Browns. Why shouldn’t he have success with a legitimate quarterback? There was similar upside attached to  Josh Doctson , who lost most of his rookie season to an Achilles injury. But among all that noise about new players, Cousins’ favorite target has been a reliable veteran.  Jamison Crowder . The third year wide-out seems poised to have a big season. Cousins has been targeting him early and often, and right now, he looks like the No. 1 receiver. He may still function as mostly a slot guy, but he will see the most targets in all likelihood. That should start on Sunday. With the Redskins offense struggling to move the ball in the early stages of the preseason, Crowder could be targeted a lot to help the team move the ball. While many may want to see Cousins spread the ball around, it makes more sense for him to get comfortable first. He can do that by focusing on connecting with Crowder. At the end of the day, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Crowder break into the triple digits for receiving yards. He will also grab a touchdown en route to jumpstarting the Redskins offense.

Here\u2019s a look at some bold predictions for the contest. < \/h2>\n The final test is rapidly approaching. Though there are four weeks of preseason football, the most important week is the third. That is the week that the starters play the most, before getting extra rest heading into the final contest. That is the final chance for the first teamers to impress. < \/p>\n The Washington Redskins are going to need a big performance in their third preseason contest. They have not looked great in their first two preseason games, and they currently sport an 0-2 record. Prior to the regular season, they will want to get their offense clicking and their defense squared away. In short, they will want to play well and have a confidence building win. < \/p>\n The Cincinnati Bengals will not be an easy battle for the team. In 2016, the two met and tied in a 27-27 battle. The Redskins had multiple chances to win, but they could not convert. They should relish a chance to prove that they are better than the Bengals. < \/p>\n With that said, the Redskins are going to have to get some great performances in order to have a victory. Here\u2019s a look at some bold predictions for the contest against Cincinnati. < \/p>\n \n     \n         Next:  < \/span>\n        No. 5\n     < \/a>\n < \/div>
