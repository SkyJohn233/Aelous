WWE NXT ' s Top 10 Best Matches of 2015 - Page 7 WWE 2015 For a match with very little build, no match on this list exceeded expectations quite like Sasha Banks vs. Becky Lynch did at NXT TakeOver: Unstoppable. Granted, the dissension between the two had been building for a while, but fans didn t have many reasons to care about the feud seeing as how it was confirmed for the card at the last minute. Moreover, neither of them were established babyfaces, but as soon as Lynch made her entrance that night, she became the biggest fan favorite on the show. She and Banks found instant chemistry as well, putting together one of the most beautiful bouts in recent memory. With one performance, Lynch won over the audience at Full Sail University. Even in defeat, she shined bright and proved she was a future star in the making.

Now, that same developmental brand is selling out arenas worldwide and giving fans a reason to love wrestling again. < \/p>\n .theiaPostSlider_nav._lower {display: none !important} < \/style> Related Story:  WWE: It's Time to Shelve the Slammys < \/span> < \/a> < \/div>\n Not only that, but it has hosted some of the greatest matches in any wrestling promotion all year. Bayley vs. Sasha Banks was a clear Match of the Year candidate, but there were several other matches as well that outshined several matchups on the main roster. < \/p>\n From the build to the execution to even the aftermath, these ten matches exemplified exactly why NXT is the best thing going in pro wrestling today.
