attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive wikipedia attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive adhd-pi or adhd-i 3 is a learning disability and one of the three presentations of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd 4 in 1987 1994 there were no subtypes and thus it was not distinguished from hyperactive adhd in the diagnostic and statistical manual dsm-iii-r the 'predominantly inattentive subtype is similar to the other presentations of adhd except that it is characterized primarily by problems with inattention or a deficit of sustained attention such as procrastination hesitation and forgetfulness it differs in having fewer or no typical symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsiveness lethargy and fatigue are sometimes reported but adhd-pi is a separate condition from the proposed cluster of symptoms known as sluggish cognitive tempo sct adhd-pi is an attention-concentration deficit that has everything in common with other forms of adhd except that it has fewer hyperactivity or impulsivity symptoms and has more directed attention fatigue symptoms 5 the dsm-5 allows for diagnosis of the predominantly inattentive presentations of adhd icd-10 code f90.0 if the individual presents six or more five for adults of the following symptoms of inattention for at least six months to a point that is disruptive and inappropriate for developmental level an adhd diagnosis is contingent upon the symptoms of impairment presenting themselves in two or more settings e.g. at school or work and at home there must also be clear evidence of clinically significant impairment in social academic or occupational functioning lastly the symptoms must not occur exclusively during the course of a pervasive developmental disorder schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder e.g. mood disorder anxiety disorder dissociative disorder personality disorder citation needed although adhd has most often been treated with medication medications do not cure adhd they are used solely to treat the symptoms associated with this disorder and the symptoms will come back once the medication stops 7 stimulants are typically formulated in fast and slow-acting as well as short and long-acting formulations the fast-acting amphetamine mixed salts adderall and its derivatives with short and long-acting formulations bind to the trace amine associated receptor and triggers the release of dopamine into the synaptic cleft 8 they may have a better cardiovascular disease profile than methylphenidate and potentially better tolerated 9 the fast-acting methylphenidate ritalin is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor 10 in the short term methylphenidate is well tolerated however long term studies have not been conducted in adults and concerns about increases in blood pressure have not been established 11 the slow and long-acting nonstimulant atomoxetine strattera is primarily a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and to a lesser extent a dopamine reuptake inhibitor it may be more effective for those with predominantly inattentive concentration 12 it is sometimes prescribed in adults who do not get enough vigilant concentration response from mixed amphetamine salts adderall or get too many side effects 13 unreliable medical source it is also approved for adhd by the us food and drug administration the use of cholinergic adjunctive medications is uncommon and their clinical effects are poorly researched 14 15 16 unreliable medical source 17 consequently cholinergics such as galantamine or varenicline would be off label use for adhd 18 19 20 new nicotinic cholinergic medications in development for adhd are pozanicline 21 non-primary source needed 22 abt-418 23 non-primary source needed and abt-894 24 non-primary source needed in some cases children who enjoy learning may develop a sense of fear when faced with structured or planned work especially long or group-based assignments that require extended focus even if they thoroughly understand the topic children with adhd may be at greater risk of academic failures and early withdrawal from school 25 teachers and parents may make incorrect assumptions about the behaviors and attitudes of a child with adhd-pi and may provide them with frequent and erroneous negative feedback e.g careless you 're irresponsible you 're immature you 're lazy you do n't care/show any effort you just are n't trying etc. 26 the inattentive children may realize on some level that they are somehow different internally from their peers however they are also likely to accept and internalize the continuous negative feedback creating a negative self-image that becomes self-reinforcing if these children progress into adulthood undiagnosed or untreated their inattentiveness ongoing frustrations and poor self-image frequently create numerous and severe problems maintaining healthy relationships succeeding in postsecondary schooling or succeeding in the workplace these problems can compound frustrations and low self-esteem and will often lead to the development of secondary pathologies including anxiety disorders mood disorders and substance abuse 25 it has been suggested 5 that some of the symptoms of adhd present in childhood appear to be less overt in adulthood this is likely due to an adult 's ability to make cognitive adjustments and develop compensating or coping skills to minimize the impact of inattentive or hyperactive symptoms however the core problems of adhd do not disappear with age 25 some researchers have suggested that individuals with reduced or less overt hyperactivity symptoms should receive the adhd-combined diagnosis hallowell and ratey 2005 suggest 27 that the manifestation of hyperactivity simply changes with adolescence and adulthood becoming a more generalized restlessness or tendency to fidget a meta-analysis of 37 studies on cognitive differences between those presenting adhd-predominantly inattentive presentations and adhd-combined type found that the adhd-c presenting performed better than the adhd-pi presenting in the areas of processing speed attention performance iq memory and fluency the adhd-pi presenting performed better than the adhd-c group on measures of flexibility working memory visual/spatial ability non-verbal iq motor ability and language both the adhd-c and adhd-pi groups were found to perform more poorly than the control group on measures of inhibition however there was no difference found between the two groups furthermore the adhd-c and adhd-pi presenting did not differ on measures of sustained attention 28 it is difficult to say exactly how many children or adults worldwide have adhd because different countries have used different ways of diagnosing it while some do not diagnose it at all in the uk diagnosis is based on quite a narrow set of symptoms and about 0.5â€“1 of children are thought to have attention or hyperactivity problems in comparison professionals in the u.s. used a much broader definition of the term adhd until recently citation needed this meant up to 10 of children in the u.s. were described as having adhd current estimates suggest that adhd is present internationally in about 7.2 of children 29 about five times more boys than girls are diagnosed with adhd boys are seen as the prototypical adhd child therefore they are more often diagnosed with adhd than girls 30 non-primary source needed this may be partly because of the particular ways they express their difficulties boys and girls both have attention problems but boys are more likely to be overactive and difficult to manage citation needed children from all cultures and social groups are diagnosed with adhd however children from certain backgrounds may be particularly likely to be diagnosed with adhd because of different expectations about how they should behave citation needed it is therefore important to ensure that a child 's cultural background is understood and taken into account as part of the assessment in 1980 the dsm-iii changed the name of the condition from hyperkinetic reaction of childhood to attention deficit disorder add that happened because research by virginia douglas had suggested that the attention deficits were more important than the hyperactive behaviour for understanding the disorder the new label also reflected the observation of clinicians that attention deficits could also exist without hyperactivity for the first time two subtypes were introduced add with hyperactivity add+h and add without hyperactivity add-h while the add+h category was fairly consistent with previous definitions the latter subtype represented essentially a new category thus almost everything that is known about the predominantly inattentive subtype is based on research conducted since 1980 31
