Everything is just perfect ♡ Shin Oct 03 2019 8:36 am Way better than the movie...and the cast was amazing especially the second lead couple Dannah Young Aug 25 2019 1:43 am This is my favorite drama of all time. ? It will be one I’ll be watching every year. Lee Min Ki and Seo Hyun Jin had my emotions all over the place and I am so in love with them. Would be super excited if they made another series together! Daisy Aug 17 2019 11:21 am There are some drunk scenes/acting style similar to My Love From the Star. Although the female lead is a good actress. Sometimes I wonder if she was trying to copy Jun Ji Hyun in this drama. Although both lead females have the same occupation (celebrities) in their dramas. Daisy Aug 17 2019 11:17 am It is soooooooooooooooooooooo dragging, it is hard to finish!!! I am also realizing the Kdrama cliches through this show, and people might get sick of the usual Kdrama template someday. I hope writers will stop making COOs look as if they’re not working Zainab Jul 25 2019 5:53 am I didn't like the film so I'm wondering if this drama is worth watching .. saranim Jul 05 2019 2:42 pm Hello, good and light drama, started well, actors are all very good! For me, it was a bit long though, they could have ended the story at 12 or 14 episodes at most. It dragged so much I couldn't feel a lot of chemistry between the leads, too bad.But enjoyed it all in all.PS: Ra Mi Ran appeared in one episode, I was so impressed once again by her acting, she made me cry (loved her in reply 1988). Skukian Jul 04 2019 10:59 am Highly Recommended!!!!this is one of those rare dramas where you fall in love with all the characters!!! it has the best cast!!! the plot although sounds stupid, is not that bad as we get further into the drama... it was funny, romantic and a completely satisfying drama.. and i really love how they didn't rush the ending.. they took their own sweet time to give us a satisfactory ending... overall it's a pretty interesting drama that is definitely worth a watch.. 8/10 Miss T Jun 24 2019 1:42 am Before I comment on the drama I must say i loved K-Will's OST for this drama. been listening to that song over and over. on to the drama The actors did well and i would have loved to see more scenes for the second couple, their chemistry was just on point. I am growing to love Seo Hyun-jin, she is just so talented and cant wait for her next drama. I loved her so much in Another Miss Oh that she made me watch this and i was not disappointed. As i was watchin i loved how Lee Min-Ki 's character was so strong and manly, so I though this was going to be one of the few Kdramas where the male lead didnt "cry", but come ep 14 he cried like a baby!! I think he would have shown his love without crying, i didnot get why he was crying that hard and why he was so emotional. But other than that it was definitly one of the best dramas for me for 2018. T Jun 23 2019 8:28 am The best drama of 2018! I love Lee Min Ki's acting. The cast is just perfect. Everyone played their roles really well. A must watch!!!! macoy Jun 09 2019 5:15 pm fan of Seo Hyun-Jin, through and through... Funny great drama!!!! Daisy Jun 08 2019 11:18 am I am currently on the 3rd ep but there are already some questionable scenes In ep 2 - How did they pass through the immigration when she changed?Or is it because where they went was within Korea so there is no need to pass through the immigration? In ep 3 - how did she filmed the “Han Se Gye for today” if her phone is with the man? crazyIkfan Jun 03 2019 10:58 am I did not expect this drama to be sooooooooo good .i enjoyed this thoroughly.fell in love with lee min ki < 3BTW what are the cars they are driving? (kept me wondering) Lovely May 20 2019 4:11 pm The lead pair or side pair are so damn cute. I love this drama so damn much. Never get bored even when i rewatched this drama. ? Lovely May 20 2019 4:08 pm I love this drama so much. The chemistery between the female lead and the male lead is really great. I enjoyed watching this drama even the story line is weird. But, this drama can make me cry like a baby. I love them, han sekye and seo do jae, hope they can be pair in others drama or maybe the next series? ♡ Lucy May 07 2019 6:42 pm i love this drama, no matter what, its entertaining for me... i enjoyed watching it alot. Frequency Freedom May 06 2019 6:46 am I love Jung Joo-Hwan/Lee Tea-Ri character.... Anne R Apr 29 2019 4:12 am I loved this series especially the main song they play, very stirring (should have subtitles for it at least once). This is only my second Asian series, (the English subtitles are a little off as they’re quite formal and sometimes obscure) but I loved the relationship of the main characters. I hope there will be a second series.?? ❤️ ?? Fafa Apr 25 2019 1:31 pm The changing appearance is only a metaphor for changing hearts or moods or feelings! At least that's what I think! Otherwise this story would totally bunkers! and sorry to say thin but the female lead needs to work on her acting skills A LLLLLLLOOOOTTTTT! Farah Apr 23 2019 10:28 am I read the synopsis looks great, but when I watched, it just boring with the female lead and male lead story, I always skip some of the scene and I hope more scene of Kang Sa Ra and Ryu Eun Ho, they are looks so good and cute couple. Well, at least it can heal with the couples of Kang Sa Ra and Ryu Eun Ho. I even hope to see them also in the end of the drama, but of course it will be show just the lead actor and actres. So sad. Kang Sa Ra looks so beautiful with her long hair in this drama. I remember her antagonis acting in I can Hear Your Voice ? I hope I can see her again very soon in another good drama as the female lead. Giana Apr 17 2019 11:25 am This drama way good but it hard plot holes. I gould have like them tp focus more on the powers the female lead had and why or how she got them...you can't get that all of a sudden without giving a proper explanation. And what about her father? They should have made her father be the one who had this power in the first place and she inherited them. That would have been believable. iKONIC Apr 05 2019 12:24 am I want to see more of Lee Min Ki oppa being a main lead. Please give him another role so we can fall in love with him more. CG Unnie Apr 02 2019 8:28 am I just can't get enough of this drama. I love all the characters including the supporting ones. Definitely one of the best feels.  < 3 10/10 Jun Mar 04 2019 10:20 am This drama is unrealistic a bit stupid.......storyline is all over place and why wont see s doctor about her changing problem ??? Unknown Mar 01 2019 7:55 am Whats the car that they drive Lorna Hendrick Feb 18 2019 4:59 pm In the first episode of beauty inside, couldn't the male lead not have been hit by a car if he pushed himself and the female lead out of the way of the car or pulled her to him instead of pushing her away and standing there Jee Feb 10 2019 11:48 pm Me loveee this drama it's was amazing story and i really like the all of ost this drama?????? Adel Feb 10 2019 11:45 pm Loooooveeee this drama so much. I love the chemistry, i love the love line story.

Really cute drama! Interactions between leads and side characters make me all happy and giigly. You should try this drama if you have time. Shandy Dec 24 2018 7:20 am Daebak this drama is so cute i love kang sa ra and ryu eun ho omg. They are sooo cute. Guiltypleasure Dec 22 2018 4:31 am Good message. Good acting. Good kiss scene. No chemistry between leads. Chemistry cute between Sara and Eun Ho. But I don't really like Eun Ho personality. He such like a gigolo E Dec 18 2018 1:32 pm I gave up in the middle of episode 4. Some parts were cute, and the story was interesting. I just wasn't hooked. Mandy Dec 12 2018 11:22 am I started because of Ahn Jae Hyun, and stayed on because it was actually quite good. Avely Nukk Dec 12 2018 6:14 am I just have to say thank you for stellar! Thanks for the song! :) Jajaha Dec 09 2018 5:00 pm What a drama, can’t stop replaying the cute scenes with the main leads together even though I had completed watching this drama. It’s really rare to see good chemistry between leads in Korean dramas, the storyline is so-so but thankfully the cast saved this show. Anyone else here kind to recommend good romcom dramas like this with good chemistry between the leads? And I got to say, Seo Hyun Jin is so damn pretty??!! I can’t believe that I didn’t watch any of her dramas before as this is the first time I had seen her acting. But sad to say, this is her best show as I couldn’t get into any of her past dramas after watching this Nicoleta Dec 07 2018 5:45 pm Beautiful, inspiring! Jaja Dec 07 2018 10:00 am i am not a fan of seo hyunJin and lee minki.BUT, i fell in love with them in this drama. the story plot is typical but the writernim is brilliant in creating characters of such.it may be unrealistic that a person can change form but miraculously i love the premise of the story.the chemistry between them were amazing, plus wonderful OSTs. i would say the best rom-com drama of 2018 Orion Dec 05 2018 8:36 pm I really love this drama, the chemistry between the leads is crazy  > // < Noni Dec 03 2018 9:38 pm This drama has such a beautiful message about self love and self acceptance. There were so many beautiful moments and just when you thought there might be a bit of kdrama cliched moments, they transform into something beautiful. Beautiful is the only word I can use to describe this drama. Just beautiful. Love, love love this drama. One of the best for 2018. Sohyun Dec 02 2018 8:39 pm Really really love the whole story! As in no boring scenes. I've watched it twice! So love!  < 3 arlene Nov 28 2018 8:05 am i love it  < 3  < 3  < 3 J Nov 26 2018 4:59 am A surprising find! Didn't really expect much. It was a bit predictable in the start, but great acting, great lines and great values. I love how they emphasize messages like loving your inner beauty and not just the outer shell. Also, that everything has a purpose. Anyone thought that Reporter Park is Woo Min's boyfriend??? PS credits to Moon Woo-Jin pls! He's such a talented child actor. Just adorable. ? lot1 Nov 26 2018 12:27 am bad storyline but good lead chemistry. Anita Nov 25 2018 8:28 am Aww... I'll miss this drama... It was the only drama ive watched this past few months simce i really couldnt find anything worthwhile. Love the ending although i really thought they willl pair Woo Mi and Joo Hwan. So sad they were kinda cute... But somethings bothering me though.. Is Joo Hwan gay in here???? Tae irene forever Nov 25 2018 12:19 am I cry a lot ? at episode 10... Who else? Rumana806 Nov 22 2018 2:27 pm Just Love this drama.Such a beautiful storyline.Each and every single character justified their roles.Even the kinhkang..One of the best dramas of 2018. Autumn Nov 22 2018 2:17 pm Best drama I've watched this year! Seo Hyun Jin is an excellent actress, i feel the pain whenever she cries from Oh Hae young to this drama.. i love the second couple! Lee da hee is very pretty and a good actress too! Casting was perfect. Good job to you all! Papau Nov 22 2018 8:42 am Seo hyun jin so beautiful in this dramaHSK, SDJ n KSR just beautiful inside stellar Nov 22 2018 8:30 am to those who are looking for the eng song, the title is Run by 2morro. And yes I actually went out of my way to listen carefully to the parts when the song was played and searched the lyrics on Google. Apparently, it was sung by 2morro--the one who sang their ost soundtrack part 5 The Love Inside which turned out to be a korean band/singer. Probably explains why lots of people had a hard time looking for it Yeoreum Nov 21 2018 7:55 pm Han Se Kye.... my hero, my sunshine...Will miss you so much TTTT Let Nov 21 2018 6:38 pm Seo Hyun-Jin is insufferable in this role. Sometimes I really wondered if she had any gray matter in her skull. I’d have tolerated the plot if it wasn’t her. The last episodes were a pain. Would not recommend. Anna Nov 21 2018 11:27 am Han Se Kye will be one of my favourite character. When Se Kye cried, i cried. When Se Kye laughed, i laughed.Thanks to Seo Hyun Jin who made Han Se Kye's character was live. Woo mi Nov 21 2018 11:03 am I'm a bit upset with the ending! Because they didn't even show us who Woo Mi boyfriend is. I feel you Eun Ho ya.. :( Tiff Nov 21 2018 10:46 am PERFECT! From the writers, to the directors, the staff, the settings, the storyline, its perfect casting of roles. (Lee Min Ki and Seo Hyun Jin fighting!) and its soundtracks. ( i may forget something to mention ) but overall, it was perfect. This is the first korean drama that I love all the characters, whether the bad or the good one, the first drama that im so inlove with all its soundtracks, and lastly the first drama that made An impressive impact To myself. I can’t say anything else. “ The beauty inside “ korean drama is so perfect. And i’m still loss for words on how to describe this drama. Because describing it as perfect is not enough. From episode 1 to 16, I can say this is a drama above perfection. Kim Nov 21 2018 6:07 am What an amazing drama!!! It was like a full package. Theres so many touching and funny moments. But there are also heartbreaking moments. The actors portrayed their characters SO well. The pace of the drama was perfect - it didnt feel rushed and it wasn't slow at all. Writers did a great job. The chemistry between the leads were off the roof!!!!! The ending is absolutely beautiful too. It truly made me feel like I will miss every single character. abcde Nov 20 2018 10:55 am definitely my favourite drama of the year!!! finally the kdrama lords granted me some drama worth waiting for every weeki get the ideas of loving the inner beauty of human not just the exterior but i've been wondering this all the time i've been watching it. How about when she is pregnant? hahaha Hyeon Nov 19 2018 3:00 am Seo Hyun Jin-ssi has to do a movie in 2019...!!!and return to dramaland soon! KdramaLover Nov 17 2018 10:03 am i still can't accept in ep02 when seo do jae trying to open se gye's phone  &  he successfully opened it. For me it still very rude attitude when you open someone belonging without her permission. Dionat Nov 16 2018 11:35 pm We need preview for the next eps??? Steph Nov 16 2018 3:47 am I have watched the Movie where his is based from and I can say that I love what the writer and the director did on this series! I love the movie but I also love this! I've watched the movie for a couple of times but the take on this one is so different and having the Woo Jin role return to one form and looks makes it a whole lot different and less heavy.I am so looking forward to the last 2 episodes of this series. Seo Hyun Jin slayed that role. I always feel like tearing up whenever she cries. And oh, her eyelashes are so long, I can help but stare. She has a beautiful pair of eyes, and it's so expressive. And (lil bit spoiler, sorry) my heart broke on the last episode. When Seo Do Jae broke down... because of Han Se Gye... i lost it. I wish they would still be together coz I really felt so sad when SDJ cried. He never really cried when he got diagnosed with Prosopagnosia and when he does because of their break up, I just can't help but be sad. It was their destiny and yet it's a sad one. So far, this is the best drama I've watched... with all the reasons laid out like that, you can understand where each character is coming from and you can't help but sympathize. I just want their characters to be happy. ㅠ^ㅠ irene.nd Nov 15 2018 10:57 pm Besides of the story, what I love the most of this drama are : 1. Seo Hyun Jin  &  Lee Da Hee's fashion style, especially Hyun Jin's Alexander McQueen clothes in episode 13; and 2. KingKang, who wouldn't love that pretty and smart doggy? Kiesha Nov 14 2018 8:47 pm Ilove seo hyun jin and lee min ke ? ihope in real life u will become boyfiend/girlfriend???? Sylvia Gunadi Nov 14 2018 8:19 am Anyone know the english song? Ilove seo hyun jin  &  lee min ke?? Nov 14 2018 5:56 am Seo hyun jin  &  lee min ke forever. ??? zee Nov 13 2018 9:46 pm best k drama ever.....love it...saddest episode when han se gye felt guilty because she's the one who makes do jae got accident 10 years ago...can't wait for the next episode .. Century Couple Nov 13 2018 7:46 pm It's almost ending now, for our century couple who has been through a lot suffer and tears, you two will have each other and life happily now. TaeOmi DeKim Nov 13 2018 5:10 pm goooooossssshhhhhh! am i an emotional wreck! especially when it comes to kdramas. the end f episode 14 made me soooooooooo emotional! it was a mixtur of frustration, anger and sadness.i am very relieved to hear that there are more episodes coming out ;) I must say, this Kdrama deserves an award!!! It is too great for words. Frann S Anderson Nov 13 2018 9:12 am Loving this drama! Seo Hyun-Jin has grown so much as an actress. She really shines in this drama. Great pairing with Lee Min Ki! The secondary stories are as compelling as the main plot which keeps you hanging on from episode to episode. I'll be sad when this drama ends. Eun Soo Nov 13 2018 8:39 am Seo Hyun Jin's visual and acting make me keep to look at the screen. I hope she won't took too long time for the next project. How about back to movie? an action movie? Jase Nov 13 2018 7:40 am Just a minor Easter egg, but isn't the movie they went to watch in episode 4 the movie this drama is based on? Abeauty Nov 13 2018 3:34 am The best drama ever, seo hyun jin ang lee min ki perfect couple for this year ❤️❤️❤️ Feh Nov 12 2018 8:55 am Best drama of 2018... kudos to the actors and actress, and the crews. LOVE IT!! huhu Nov 11 2018 4:12 am I loooooooooooooveeeee this drama!!! Best drama of 2018!!! :D Alit Nov 09 2018 4:29 am Best drama 2018 so far ? Kola Nov 08 2018 11:18 am Seo Hyun Jin is the best actress,,,I love all of her drama Sweet potato Nov 07 2018 8:52 am Seo Hyun Jin! you are the reason i watch this drama from beginning to end! Drama lovers Nov 07 2018 8:50 am Why no one talk about how great Seo Hyun Jin as Se Kye and all actors who play as the changing's Se Kye can harmonize well as one character/person. I can see the real Se Kye while watching them. Especially Ra Miran crying scene, when she cried out in the washroom then suddenly back as Seo Hyun Jin with pale teary face, just wow... big applause to their acting. Sylvia Gunadi Nov 07 2018 8:05 am Anyone know english song that play in ep 12 when eunho drink with sara? aaaa Nov 06 2018 3:25 pm I really like Lee Da-Hee's acting in this drama ,also his relationship with Ahn Jae-Hyeon is interesting and funny. Fleur Nov 06 2018 10:27 am That's so amazing.... For me, this drama is best of the year. N Nov 06 2018 12:51 am why I am more interested in relationship between sa-ra and eun-ho? I really love their chemistry ♥♥ Ninfialoves Nov 04 2018 4:44 am @Kimiko I'm with you. I watch this drama because I'm a big fan of Lee Da Hee since I hear you voice. She is a great actress and I totally in love with her character in this drama. I think sa ra's character suit her the most. I'm so glad she get more fans. Fightinggg Lee Da Hee! TheMaleCryer Nov 02 2018 1:49 am I cried twice while watching through episode 1 to 10 for this drama... 1st when they confessed their love on the hospital roof... the 2nd part that made my tears stream down like broken dam is when omma passed away... that part really hits me hard... to all mom in the world especially my mom... I love you omma... please stay healthy forever... ;( and be with us forever... Angie Nov 01 2018 4:59 am is it just me or is ahn jae hyun getting much better at acting? i think he is one of those actors that suit supporting roles... like kang ki young﻿ PrettyMaita Oct 31 2018 2:24 pm I just watched episode 10, and it really made me cry. This is the best episode that i’ve watched so far. There’s romance, comedy and drama in this episode that i’ve really enjoyed. As early as now, let us show how we love our moms, dads and family members before it’s too late. :) Avely Nukk Oct 31 2018 8:00 am Does someone know that the song was at the end part in episode 3? when Seo Do-Jae sees Han Se-Kye at that airport thing. DKlove Oct 31 2018 2:21 am I love everything about this drama. The chemistry between the main leads, the friendship betweeen segye eunho and woomi, the relationship between kang sara and eunho. And kingkang! I also love those actors who play as segye. They’re great! The acting is superb. Love this drama. Kingkang Oct 31 2018 1:23 am Very good storyY!!! Every episode was amazing. The chemistry between LMK and SHJ was amazing too. Episode 10 makes me cry a lot Huhuhuhu. eun ho and sa ra was cute too.... I’m so excited to see love scene both of them hihihi brenda Oct 28 2018 3:24 pm kingkang so cuuute Nanana Oct 28 2018 9:02 am I love this drama very much!! ❤❤Seo Hyunjin and Lee Minki Chemistry is so natural and undeniable. I love this couple, so cute and so pureeefect together.And the drama production is good, and love all the fashion.. ?? manni Oct 28 2018 8:16 am The story gets really interesting as it progresses!! Plus the osts are really good specially the one with Wendy and Kwill. Elle Oct 27 2018 9:20 am The trailer for ep 9 is killing me!!!!! ❤️ way0leto Oct 27 2018 8:09 am Love it when han se gye transform to kim min suk. It's a reunion with lee min ki. They both was in because its my first life and shut up flower boyband. Love it! Fan Oct 25 2018 12:03 pm When lee min ki smirk. Kyaaaaaaaaa  > . < And Oct 24 2018 2:06 pm I love the quirkiness in this drama, especially when Se Gye transforms into someone else.But what's more interesting is the relationship between Kang Daepyo-nim and Eun-ho. I hope there will be more scenes of this awkward couple :D Kk Oct 24 2018 5:26 am Anyone know what is the title of bgm english song that play in episode8? vini26 Oct 24 2018 3:59 am I'm very addicted to Lee Min Ki's acting. The story is so interesting and funny. All of people in this drama is so good in acting and suitable. ? A Oct 23 2018 9:55 pm now that i've watched up to episode 6, i think the show is hitting its stride. Each new transformation brings something new, charming and comedic to the table so even though the main couple are together now, i'm not afraid of the plot getting stale. also been loving all the cameos so far. i especially liked Kim Min Suk (?)'s role as the high school male Se Gye. It's amazing how he studied her mannerisms and method of talking. DO Oct 23 2018 7:50 am Han Se Kye, I cannot stop looking at her. I've seen her few dramas before, but I don't know why but she's an angel here ❣️ Mari Oct 20 2018 8:49 am O.M.G. Can't describe how much I love this drama. It's been a long time since I last watch a Korean drama that is currently on air, I usually wait for the drama to end before watching it on marathon. But this drama just got me hooked!! Let's see if this drama can get into my list of must-repeat-watching. I came from the movie, the movie was beautiful. Honestly I didn't expect anything from this drama, because many things are changed compared to the movie. But still, for the time being, the drama is beautiful, though a different kind of beautiful from the movie. I would recommend this drama to be watched! p/s: The OST is good too, especially by Vincent and Davichi  < 3 sari Oct 19 2018 11:30 am i really love this drama as much as i love the movie version. I love how they flip the story with the same conflict. The casting are great. I just love this so much. How they change it, sometimes there are times that when some drama are having a new version it always sucks to the point that you cant watch that version but for this! This is what you call a good drama version! I cant stop watching this. I hope they made it little longer. Jaliper Oct 19 2018 7:16 am Ahn Jae-Hyeon and Lee Min Ki are two of my top fave actors. I originally watch it because of them but deym that story is soooo good. Rendi Oct 18 2018 11:42 pm Lee min ki is a good choice playing this kind of role, just like in "bcs this is my first life" drama, the same cold inflexible character, hyun jin is also good choice as a laid back but stern character, and im excited about this drama, especially after the great movie, however after seeing the early eps (2 is enough for me) I'm dropping this one. Idk, maybe im too overexpect things but i feel this drama wasted a good source material and only pick up the "changing appearance" factor only. I dont see chemistry among minki and hyun jin even though usually in dramas the main pair always bickering and be together in the end, no clear story, forced plot, too many meh jokes and cheap slapstick, i just think the movie deserves better adaptation. Kimiko Oct 18 2018 10:37 pm Im actually onboarded on this drama for Lee Da Hee. She may not be the lead on this drama but she's definitely killin it. I swear she really suites this type of roles. I also like that they made her character not so evil and very likable. Now just waiting for her and Ahn Jae Hyeon's ship to sail but their random encounters are already a sweet tease and Im lovin every second of it. Kdg 03/09 Oct 18 2018 9:16 pm The chemistry between the leads is sooo damn fine even when Han Se Gye portrayed by Kim Min Seok, i still got the chemistry. And honestly it's kinda trigger my fujo side hahaha. It's just because Seo Hyun Jin and Lee Min Ki build the chemistry perfectly, and the support actors that portrayed any kind of Han Se Gye delivered the act so good, too. Btw i never watch an on going drama before coz i hate to waittt and stuff, but this one is worth wait and worth watch. 지수빙수 Oct 18 2018 6:19 pm i'm in love with this drama!!!! Omggg why so cute, funny and make me "aaaw" every time Seo Do Jae with Han Se Gye togetherrrr ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Seo Hyun Jin is sooo pretty ? love her so much! And Lee Da Hee yassss so hot omgosh. Not forget to mention how handsome Lee Min Ki is :'( his taking shower scenes ? Roza Oct 18 2018 11:55 am It’s really good drama actually I am Korean drama crazy but this drama i didn’t watch it because of actor I don’t like him but when I watched short video it’s quite nice so I watched it released episodes all day night. So now I’m waiting for new ep so excited to see again.?? yuki chan Oct 18 2018 10:34 am only reason ti warch this drama is LEE tae ri.......so freakin cute Die Schwarzgelben Oct 17 2018 10:56 pm Lee Da-hee in this series looks damn hot. HyunKi Oct 17 2018 12:10 am Seriously, this drama driven me crazy, i just love Lee min Ki and Seo Hyun jin chemistry and thought they already in love as person (not as their character). Lola Oct 15 2018 1:18 pm Everything from Lee Min Kee and Seo Hyun Jin is amazing. They are one of the best in K-Drama. I guess, good or bad script they will no doubt pull it through and make it happen. This drama had an interesting start and keeps on getting better every on going episode. I really don't agree to negative comments. I LOVE, enjoy and will support till the very end! LMK - SHJ you're the BEST! silly Oct 15 2018 12:17 pm I haven't watch the movie. But reading all the negative comments from the people that already watched the movie, I don't think i'm going to. Personally i think this is a great movie. Just don't compare it to the movie. For me who haven't watch the movie, this is an excellent drama. Min Oct 15 2018 11:19 am Nooo flower I disagree it is is really a good drama ... It has a bit natural thing but obviously it has to be different from the movie it should be why to watch the same thing again ... And I came Because of Ahn Jae Hyun .. please do support them ... I haven't seen till the latest episodes but it is quite nice though they should show a good bonding of lead coactor and actress that's what u want I guess ... Good drama overall ... Flower Oct 12 2018 9:49 pm Currently at ep4. And for me, its kind of disappointment a bit ...Movie of this drama, wrap up very nice, sad and amazing plus impress me. I expect this drama will amaze me too, but sadly.. Up to episode 3 its getting bored and lots of times wasted over flashback memory, playing hard to get, and again lee min ki deal with contract 'love' partner.. I watched this drama bc of lee min ki and ahn jae hyun,.. The plot is totally different from the movie, and i think..... I don't really like this drama plot. I don't think i am going to watch next episode, may be i wait till all episode done,then i skip to final ep, just to see how they wrap up. We have different type of taste as a viewer, don't mind my comment, i just point out my opinion. For me, its doesn't impressed me much, doesn't worth my time. Eun Ji Oct 11 2018 1:33 pm Yay this is to much JTBC.....ep 1 is captivating for me already.....I'll wait every week to be aired....Aja!!!... Elle Oct 10 2018 12:45 pm Min-ki never fail to make me smile like an idiot in every character he played. And I think Hyun Jin is getting prettier and more charismatic compare to ger previous dramas. ❤️ Tami Oct 10 2018 3:01 am The beauty inside goal!! Minki  &  hyunjin so perfect!! ❤️❤️ An Oct 09 2018 10:54 am Im sooooooo into this drama right now. The leads are match made in heaven and the drama is light, funny, touching and captivating all at the same time. Bae Oct 09 2018 5:57 am I regret watching this when it’s still on-going. I’ll go crazy having to wait week by week.. zz Oct 07 2018 1:44 pm I think I'm going crazy for this one ♥♥♥♥ Fa.Ta.L Oct 06 2018 9:55 pm Anyone who knows the title of the english song that was played in episode 1 when se gye was running away during the awards ceremony scene??? Andrea Oct 05 2018 9:10 pm @cb yes yes! same director of Another Miss Oh, that's the reason behind the same vibes it gives, just like Another Miss Oh.

Also, why Ahn jae hyeon always looks young? He still looks like a 28 year old tho Steezy Yeezy Oct 03 2018 2:44 am Why on earth does Ahn Jae Hyun still give off that vibe of being like 19 when he's bloody 31 in this drama. His young looks always confuses me lol legitarmpits Oct 03 2018 2:00 am is it just me or Hyunjin sometimes looks like Jessica Jung at some angles? cb Oct 02 2018 8:35 am is this drama have the same director or cameramen with Another Miss Oh drama ? cause I feel like it is Ranido Oct 02 2018 1:42 am Hope to see Han Hyo Joo cameo on this drama Caramel cake Oct 02 2018 12:28 am The male lead acting so flat Him Ne Se Oh Oct 01 2018 5:57 pm I hate to say some actor looks like another since its so frequent in asian coutries, but I can't pass without saying it: Min ki looks like park hae jin's double. terrific ressemblance!

PANDORA Sep 19 2018 1:23 pm Lee Min-Ki, Lee Min-Ki, Lee Min-Ki!  < 3My favourite actor. There is no role he can ' t do. From a serial killer (Monster 2104) to a handsome introvert cat lover (Because This is My First Life 2018). BTIMFL is my favourite drama to this day. I can ' t wait to see how he does in this, looks so fun and interesting! The cameo ' s will be great too from the teasers (love teaser #2) Kiera Sep 19 2018 9:49 am Ahn jae hyun is super handsome!! Why he has to be the second lead?? I love him so much Maninder Kaur Sep 19 2018 2:01 am Did anyone noticed little cute dog's reaction while watching TV in a new teaser ?????? Waiting to watch Seo Hyun Jin in this drama ❤❤❤❤ Laura Sep 18 2018 8:55 am Looking forward to this drama. beautyinsidefan Sep 16 2018 11:32 pm Okay so The director, and the Actors are already boom. Like I can't wait for october to be here. I was crying due to boredom. Seriously, the dramas that are on now are so lacklastor. So When I saw the combination of this show let alone the story itself, it was salvation for a drama watcher like myself. So to say i'm beyond anxious for this show is an underestimate.Song Hyun Wook never disappoints, and my beautiful oppa and unnie will definitely sell me love like no one's business. And I don't mind, sell it please. param Sep 11 2018 8:49 am i really love the movie version, i hope the drama is also good teriyaki Sep 10 2018 11:51 am Seo Hyun Jin soo stunning on poster .... wow... hwaiting dorayaa Sep 09 2018 3:54 am Seo Hyunjin ❤️ so pretty woman. nandar Sep 03 2018 7:59 am Ohhyuk voice❤️❤️❤️ Ore-sama Aug 15 2018 1:53 pm Hope there will be some interesting cameo appearance to be looking forward!

Yoo Chan Jul 27 2018 1:34 pm Ryu Hwa Young joined this drama!!! Yippieee~~ I'm so anticipate every her drama. Chae Yoori is such different character again after Rayoung,Yina and Hari last year :DD GoodPerson Jul 25 2018 5:53 pm Seo Hyun Jin unnie i cheer you...!!! fiona Jul 22 2018 7:51 pm AJH??? Is he gonna played in this drama? I just came here because of him. I love AJH so much. Angel Grace Jul 21 2018 1:43 am Everyone, the main actress is Seo Hyun Jin. The plot says that her appearance changes and have the same appearance for 1 week. Which means that after one week, she will go back to her original physical appearance. Unlike the movie that the character never had the same face twice. PSJisLove Jul 18 2018 3:19 am Anticipating this show big time! Lee Min Ki is just wow. Every role he played were all fantastic! Plus the fact that the movie version of this drama is a very great one too. The Beauty Inside fighting! Anita Jul 17 2018 8:58 am If she changes everytime then how come there is a main actress? Dont get me wrong i love seo hyun jin thats why im asking this actually because it will be dissapointing to wait for this drama and find out im gonna only see her for a week or two. Hetwashing D: Jul 12 2018 12:46 am Why am I not surprised... I was looking forward to this one Giana Jul 11 2018 3:41 am aahh, .she changes every month .. maybe the plot will focus on that 1 month, when he becomes hyunjin,. Giana Jul 11 2018 3:32 am yeayy,,minki will act in the drama again,. usually he takes a long break before comeback to drama again,.i thought the woman will be changes every day, so why they must had a lead female?but it will be one of drama with so many cameos,. hopefully it'll be great,. Saphire Jul 10 2018 11:47 am Seo Hyun Jin and Ahn Jae Hyun is best friend in real life (actually Seo Hyun Jin and Goo Hye Sun are the bestie) then they gonna meet in this drama as best friend as well? couldn't explain how excited me...fighting for all the cast! 2dum Jul 10 2018 10:04 am Blue ssi read properly. One week every month not everyday blue Jul 10 2018 9:43 am why is the actress casted?? if she is going to be changing faces everyday, wouldnt there be a series of cameos?? deee Jul 09 2018 9:50 am This would require many cameo appearances for every change in appearance. Whoa!!!! I'm excited!!!! Jerry Jerry Jul 09 2018 6:51 am Lee min kiFighting!I can't wait watch this drama. Nux Jul 09 2018 4:22 am Seo Hyun-Jin is my favourite Kdrama actress.

Please accept  < 3 Rohya Jun 28 2018 12:49 am I can imagine how gorgeous AJH would be as the priest!! He has those calm and mysterious vibes that will perfectly suit to his role. AJH fighting!!!!
