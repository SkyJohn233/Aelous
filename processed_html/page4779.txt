Electronic address: mcmahonl@uthscsa.edu.< p> >< Some drugs that are positive allosteric nAChR modulators in vitro,desformylflustrabromine (dFBr), PNU-120596 and LY 2087101, have not been fullycharacterized in vivo. These drugs were examined for their capacity to share ormodify the hypothermic and discriminative stimulus effects of nicotine (1mg/kgs.c.) in male C57Bl/6J mice. Nicotine, dFBr, and PNU-120596 produced significant hypothermia, whereas LY 2087101 (up to 100mg/kg) did not. Nicotinedose-dependently increased nicotine-appropriate responding and decreased responserate; the respective ED50 values were 0.56mg/kg and 0.91mg/kg. The modulatorsproduced no more than 38% nicotine-appropriate responding up to doses thatdisrupted operant responding. Rank order potency was the same for hypothermia andrate-decreasing effects: nicotine > dFBr > PNU-120596=LY 2087101. Mecamylamine andthe α4β2 nAChR antagonist dihydro-β-erythroidine, but not the α7 antagonistmethyllycaconitine, antagonized the hypothermic effects of nicotine. In contrast,mecamylamine did not antagonize the hypothermic effects of the modulators. Thecombined discriminative stimulus effects of DFBr and nicotine were synergistic,whereas the combined hypothermic effects of nicotine with either dFBr orPNU-120596 were infra-additive. PNU-120596 did not modify the nicotinediscriminative stimulus, and LY 2087101 did not significantly modify eithereffect of nicotine. Positive modulation of nicotine at nAChRs by PNU-120596 andLY 2087101 in vitro does not appear to confer enhancement of the nAChR-mediatedhypothermic or discriminative stimulus effects of nicotine. However, dFBr appearsto be a positive allosteric modulator of some behavioral effects of nicotine atdoses of dFBr smaller than the doses producing unwanted effects (e.g.hypothermia) through non-nAChR mechanisms.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.
