december 2016 writerly instincts on many nba stars are built like nfl players that is except for the san antonio spurs kawhi leonard actually has some pretty beefy muscles but he s the biggest on the team by far his built-up muscles are atypical for san antonio compare a few famous physiques nba nfl sf lebron james 6-8 260 lbs de j.j. watt 6-6 240 lbs sf larry johnson 6-7 250 lb lawrence taylor 6-6 250 sg derek fisher 6-1 210 rb reggie bush 6-0 203 lbs think about those numbers compare michael jordan s height weight sg michael jordan 6-6 216 lbs sg dwyane wade 6-2 220 lbs and jordan was big for the league of his day when he first entered the league mj weighed only 200 pounds he bulked up after the pistons manhandled him in both the 1989 and 1990 eastern conference finals using their new defensive strategy the jordan rules jordan himself attributes his 1991 success in defeating the jordan rules to his increased power and bulk from off-season strength training see espn films 30 for 30 bad boys this seems to mark the beginning of the arms race in ever more massive nba bodies the trend s logical conclusion shaquille o neal heaviest and some would argue most overrated nba star of all-time shaq scored a lot passed the ball little if you re seven feet tall have explosive strength and you weigh 100+ pounds more than the individual guarding you why wouldn t you too many nba teams today feature an incredibly powerful superstar give him the ball and have him fly at the rim scattering smaller defenders like bowling pins it makes for some eye-popping individual player highlights but i prefer team ball ball movement is nba conventional wisdom but it s also something of a lost art the tv-announcer euphemism for high-time-of-possession individuals is the go-to player nba coaches use the term ball stopper that term indicates the stoppage of ball movement on offense not on defense while there s nothing about built-up muscles that prevents a player from passing the ball if you were bigger stronger and faster than nine of ten players on the floor it would seem a rational choice to keep the ball and score 35 points it s a legitimate choice i suppose but is it merely a distraction from the true team-nature of basketball is it just a coincidence that coach popovich has put together his team without any players that could pass for an nfl linebacker some of the league s current young guns eric bledsoe 6-1 200 lbs dwight howard 6-10 265 corey magette 6-5 225 this is a shoe the spurs just don t fit am i right i mean think about this collection of guys tony parker 6-1 180 lbs manu ginobli 6-6 200 lbs danny green 6-6 205 kawhi leonard 6-7 225 matt bonner 6-10 235 tim duncan 7-0 250 of their amazing 2014 finals dominance manu ginobili commented on how differently the spurs play in the bleacher report piece passing stats illustrate spurs dominance in finals ginobili says if you don t have as much talent you still can do it you can move the ball and put a lot of pressure on the defense he may as well have said if you don t have as much muscle judging from their bodies as a team the spurs don t just play different they are different my chipped knife on the magnetic knife holder i recently found this knife of ours had become chipped pretty badly i didn t care all that much not only was it a castoff from a friend who d downsized her kitchen it was just a 40 item from chicago cutlery had the chipping appeared on our 140 wusthof chef s knife i would have cared a lot this knife nah when i found it chipped i sneered briefly planned obsolescence my filipino parents would say of this scenario sayang as in what a waste i cook without my reading glasses so didn t notice the chipping til it got pretty bad turns out i should have been sayang -ing at myself the chipping wasn t caused by cheap flawed steel or poor quality control it was me after hand-washing my knives i stand them on edge to air dry i learned somewhere that air-drying is best for keeping knives sterile after washing turns out air-drying is perfect — if you want droplets of water to collect on the cutting edge weakening the steel as they slowly evaporate then when sharpened the weak spots flake rather than grind hence the chips now for the happy ending by chance in an airport lounge i learned of my errant ways from the today show a quick google search then led me to this youtube tutorial have a look-see at how to easily repair a chipped knife murray carter of carter cutlery going to town on his knife for regular-maintenance sharpening i d been using a rolling-wheel sharpener below bad not only is the grain to coarse its design makes it impossible to keep a consistent grinding angle this contributes to the chipping this blunt instrument as it were wreaking havoc on the weakened steel we do have a rarely used whetstone i d never used it because the user manual insists on a technique that s slow to the point of absurdity pull the knife toward you five times for two seconds each time then reverse directions away five times repeat this alternating cycle fifty to one hundred times little roll-ie sharpener wrong the whetstone used murray-carter style gif-image above is actually a real pleasure and fast too whetstone extrordinaire in september i put on a new chain after just two weeks it started showing rust yes i do lockup outside but the rust would come even after dry sun-baked weather what the hell the rust does come off easily but i found myself having to lube five times a month uh no i don t love my bike that much so what caused the premature corrosion had my lbs local bicycle shop sold me an old chain that had been sitting on a back shelf for years no with the rust off the steel plates gleam way too brightly for that scenario i did switch brands of lubricant earlier in the year was that the problem couldn t be — otherwise my previous chain would ve demo d this problem too i ll cut to the chase the problem was me yep i got lazy rather than my standard style of chain maintenance in which i use a lot of oil i started a new lubing regimen of only a single drop on each link just a single drop freed me from the interminable chore of wiping off excess oil i hate having black grimy fingers and a backache with only a single drop per link i could just wave a towel at my bike from ten feet away and call it done the question of one single drop per link versus five is a raging debate on the web countless expert bike maintenance articles recommend a single drop of chain lube my whole life i d been in the five-drops camp why change now i ll tell you why i m pushing 50 hunching over for ten minutes straight to wipe off excess oil is a young man s game or so i thought using just a single drop may have saved me the initial headache of wiping the chain but talk about penny wise pound foolish lubing every five days easily tripled my chain-lubing work each month now i had this chore six times per month instead of once or twice i got so tired of crouching down i splurged on a 130 bike stand so i could at least i could stand upright but that meant hoisting my anchor-heavy 1980 s steel mountain bike onto the stand and fiddling it into the tricky clamp and when the weather got too cold to do the work outside i d have to carry this beast of a bike 43 lbs with full fenders and a rack up two flights of stairs did i mention i m forty-nine years old plus turns out the main reasons i switched to the single-drop method aren t as persuasive after three months of all this hassle back in august the single-drop advocates had me convinced with their seeming logic well people i ve tried it your way it s just not worth it you might be right my drive train might wear out faster or a broken link might strand me on a trail miles from nowhere but i don t give a crap anymore i did care for a few months never again i ve never in my life had a chain break on me have you i watched an exceptionally good horror film on netflix called the babadook one thing i like to do after seeing a good movie is try to reverse engineer the screenplay what was the spark that inspired the screenwriter in this case the spark was likely a familiar domestic scenario in fiction what tvtropes.org calls maternal death blame the child — i.e. the mother dies in childbirth and the father resents the child in this breakout australian film the genders are reversed it s the father who dies in a horrific auto accident while rushing his pregnant wife to the hospital fast-forward seven years and you have single mother amelia struggling to raise her stormy high-strung son sam the lines on amelia s face hint at the toll sam has taken on her with his eccentric hyperactivity at just seven years old sam has developed a spastic repertoire of magician s tricks while fashioning homespun mechanical weapons that shatter windows and break dishes the film makes clear sam s motive in demanding all of his mother s attention he s afraid she doesn t love him it s his greatest fear and in a horror film your greatest fear can turn murderous amelia begins to fear this about herself as well has she stopped loving her son though her affection for sam is obvious her sanity is wearing thin she puts out sam s fires left and right sam ejected from school for bad behavior sam shoving his cousin out of her tree fort and breaking her nose amelia is also horribly sleep deprived with sam s birthday also the anniversary of her husband s death fast approaching she s plagued by nightmares of the car crash that decapitated her husband seven years before sam has nightmares too amelia must soothe him long into the night the best way is to let him sleep in her bed but she s robbed of her own sleep as he clings to her in two memorable close-ups sam s hand grips her throat or he grinds his teeth right next to her ear as the sleep deprivation wears on her amelia begins to lose her temper she snaps at sam curses even if you re so hungry why don t you eat shit she apologizes horrified at herself but we re not surprised we see she s on the verge of a nervous breakdown tellingly that s when the babadook a supernatural creature from a super-creepy children s book begins to terrorize them in their shadowy house amelia reading the pop-up book the babadook to her son sam he slows her attack long enough to wrest her attention i know you don t love me he shouts the babadook won t let you it s at that moment the film so movingly reveals the central metaphor that amelia s grief at the loss of her husband poisons her relationship to her child the babadook represents her resentment resentment kills relationships at the risk of revealing too much let s just say sam battles the babadook to the end when i bought a fancy bike last year i felt i needed to upgrade my security for it holy cow is there ever a swamp of options to wade through when choosing a bike lock cable locks u-locks chains kryptonite onguard blackburn abus and they re all so different after many hours of research i picked a very secure lock then immediately had buyer s remorse i wish someone had told me to consider weight and convenience my purchase a kryptonite u-lock model new york lock m-18wl for 120 while very secure at 6.5 lbs it s a total pain to carry around after a few months i got tired of schlepping that monster everywhere and had to find another lighter-weight lock two basic design principles had originally led me to buy the new york lock m-18 a narrow shackle and 16mm thickness or greater these two design features neuter the two most common attacks against u-locks 1 bottle jacks bike thieves can bust open nearly any u-lock using a twenty-dollar tool available at any hardware store called a bottle jack as demonstrated in this video darn youtube has taken down all videos of bottle jacks defeating u-locks that is unless the shackle is too narrow to fit a bottle jack inside the u if the jack won t fit it s useless against the lock here s a photo of a bottle jack beginning to warp a u-lock shackle photo credit needed 2 bolt cutters a shackle with a thickness of 16mm is too thick for the jaws of even the largest bolt cutters less than 16 mm can easily be cut by bolt cutters like this the little brother of my new york lock m-18 called the new york fahgettaboudit mini 90 has both a narrow shackle and an 18mm thickness and it s lighter and smaller its shackle is only 4 inches long instead of 8 inches making the nyf mini only 4.55 pounds i could have saved myself more research by just going with it http //www.kryptonitelock.com/pages/productinformation.aspx pnumber=997986 but that s still heavy worse an even bigger problem is its shackle is actually too small to be practical it s so small people ride around with the nyf mini stuffed in their back pockets for portability that s a pretty great feature however the shackle is so narrow it severely limits the ways in which one can lock up a bike it can lock a bike frame to a bike rack but without room for either of the wheels plus if your frame tubing is oversized as mine is good luck using the nyf mini on a thicker street pole like a parking meter it just won t work and the lock is too small to lock up just the rear wheel as shown below with a larger lock photo credit needed i eventually found a u-lock by onguard the brute mini 70 which hits the sweet spot between strength and weight at 16.8mm thickness the brute mini is impervious to bolt cutter attack yet the lock weighs in at a svelte 3 lbs the shackle is also about 15 larger than the nyf mini with just that much additional size i rarely have difficulty locking up my bike yet the shackle is still too small to fit a bottle jack see my photo at the top of this post there s no way to fit a bottle jack inside the shackle http //onguardlock.com/products/u-locks/brute-mini-u-lock/ lots of people use cable locks because they re cheap and convenient they re lightweight and easy to stow but against bolt cutters they get snipped like ribbons steel-jacketed cable locks are a little better because they re fatter but they re better only to the extent that a thief would need a second tool to get through it one tool to flatten or saw through the very thin outer steel jacket and bolt cutters for the inner cable see the outer jacket separated from its inner cable below photo credit http //lettershometoyou.wordpress.com/ case-hardened hex link chain might seem like a solid option especially since it is marketed to motorcycle owners but the thickest hex chain is only 14mm thus a pair of 42-in bolt cutters can quickly dispense with even a 150 chain as seen here plus a three-foot length of 14mm hex chain will run about 10 pounds and that s not including the lock there is a security chain manufacturer in the uk called almax which produces thicker non-hex links but again the weight such beasts were never meant to be carried on a bicycle maybe for locking up at home but certainly not to carry on one s daily commute in my research i came across the very cool tigr lock sadly i found it just after its kickstarter campaign had expired doh missed my chance to get one for 100 now that they re on the market the 0.75-in version is 165 and the 1.25-in version is 220 http //tigrlock.com/ wired magazine reviewed the tigr lock as deliver ing the holy grail of locks strength and lightness the 1.25-in version is immune to bolt cutters and weighs a mere 1.5 lbs be still my heart but i m just not able to plunk down 220 for a bike lock maybe if i hadn t already squandered so much on that 120 albatross the new york lock m-18 sigh update i spoke too soon in praising the tigr lock have a look at this video granted the tigr lock being cut in the video is the 0.75-in model but the bolt cutters snip that lock so easily it s hard to believe the wider version would make much difference the 1.25-in model is wider not thicker ever heard of the liquid nitrogen attack in bike thievery lore a lock can be shattered if frozen with liquid nitrogen then hit with a hammer in the wild liquid nitrogen is simply not a common threat here s a discussion of it http //www.creekcats.com/pnprice/bikelock.html also rare is the angle grinder attack the first time i saw an angle grinder in action my heart sank an angle grinder can dispense with any lock listed here in 90 seconds quicker with any lesser lock much quicker the good news is they cause a scene they throw a shower of sparks and shriek like a banshee https //www.youtube.com/watch v=bphyy1pnjg8 to guard against an angle grinder attack one simply needs to park one s bike where 90 seconds of sparks and screeching noise would be unwise for the thief photo credit needed no matter what type of lock you use there s one security principle that undergirds all scenarios how long you leave your bike unattended the longer a bike sits in one spot the higher the chances it will catch the eye of a bike thief also knowledge that the owner won t return anytime soon puts the bike thief at ease that s the worst kind of bike thief the brazen thief the confident thief even if your bike is secured well given unlimited time bike thieves will take what they can photo luca masters ever get that dry cracked skin on your knuckles or at the side-edges of a fingertip i can t tell you how many different hand creams i ve tried to prevent it in these wisconsin winters it s a real problem it s not only the physical discomfort it s the anxiety of being out and about in the world with what are essentially open wounds entrepreneurs shake a lot of hands i ve had to pull out the big guns i ve tried a couple of expensive specialty products and some not so specialty home remedies turns out the best of the lot is also the cheapest namely lip balm chapstick burt s bees kiehl s facial fuel etc give any of them 36 hours with your cracked-skin convalescence and they ll put you on the road to epidermal ease make sure you wash your hands before applying or risk an infection also important put away the liquid hand soaps til springtime especially the antibacterial ones get yourself a gentle bar soap with a lower
