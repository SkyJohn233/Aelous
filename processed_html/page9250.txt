Current Resident : &# xA0; I have only lived in The Village for two years now but I love the small town feel with easy access to downtown OKC. The Village is an older established town where everyone looks out for each other. I love that I know all my neighbors and when I ' m home in the summer I can hear children out playing. It really is a hard to find tight nit community of all ages. The only thing it lack are better public schools and a little more nightlife! Read  12 Reviews Nearby Resident : &# xA0; Nichols Hills is a neighborhood that gives the surrounding area greater value. The varied financial statuses provide the community something to aspire to. Nichols Hills sprawling homes and manicured lawns amidst middle and lower class communities provide an artistic ideal of what can be achieved in the United States. Read  5 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I love Grove. The lake, the atmosphere, and the locals are all spectacular! Grove is currently revitalizing our downtown by adding new shops, restaurants, and tourist attractions. It is one of the best retirement towns in the nation but provides many activities for the younger generations as well. Read  19 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I liked how Newcastle is a small town. Newcastle is not very far from the city either. Everyone in Newcastle is close and the whole community always has one another ' s back. Read  18 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Marlow is a small town.  There are small shops and good restaurants.  There is a park and a splash pad for the kids to utilize.  The local pool is a great place to spend a summer day.  It is large enough to enjoy but small enough to be relaxing.  They have an awesome school system.  The faculty and staff all seem to care about the students and their success.  The community if very involved with the schools too.  The only downfall I have experienced is that as with most small communities, everybody seems to know everybody ' s business.  Overall Marlow is a great town and I would recommend it anyone looking for a nice small town with an excellent school system. Read  13 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I like Goldsby for three important reasons.  One reason is that you feel like you are in the country but in reality you are only 10 minutes away from downtown Norman.  The second reason i like Goldsby is because of the awesome people here.  Everyone is friendly and incredibly nice.  The third reason i like Goldsby is because it is close to the University of Oklahoma and i love going to college football games. Read  1 Review Current Resident : &# xA0; I have lived in Edmond, OK for 10 years and I am proud to call it home. It s a very family-friendly area, safe, lots of chain restaurants and shops, incredible schools that people come from out of state to attend, and quick access to anything you need. Anything and everything in Edmond is from 5-15 minutes away from wherever you are. Great neighborhoods, is constantly expanding with new growth and building, and high police patrol. Highly recommend to anyone looking into living here! Read  410 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; We have lived in Perry, OK for 20+ years.  We love the town and people!  This town has a very rich heritage! This is one of the starting places for the Cherokee Strip Landrun.  There is a museum with a one-room school house where schools around Oklahoma come to allow their students to have this amazing experience.  The downtown area of Perry has very historic buildings along with the new which have replaced older structures which had deteriorated over the 100+ years of their existence.  The city itself has several companies which support the population.   The only downfall which we have experienced in this city is the continued rise in the city utilities.  These utilities are among the highest in Oklahoma.   There has been a renewed interest in bringing new businesses into a declining economy which has stimulated some growth in the town.  Overall the atmosphere in the town is very welcoming and friendly.  This is a wonderful community in which to raise children or even to retire! Read  3 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I remember thinking how I couldn ' t wait to move away and to get away from this small town that has nothing to do for young adults, but as I ' ve gotten older I have come to love this small town and there is nowhere else I would rather live.  The schools are great, I feel safe in this town, job opportunities are everywhere, and our community is outstanding. Read  111 Reviews Niche User : &# xA0; Small town environment. Really feel at home Read  4 Reviews Niche User : &# xA0; I love living here in Colcord, Oklahoma. I love hunting, fishing, and riding horses and this little town allows me to do it all. If I want to go fishing I just have to load up and go fishing, and it is the same with hunting. There is plenty of country where you can go and sight the gun in and I can also shoot me a deer. I did not realize how much I love this place until I started talking about it. Read  3 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I have lived here all my life. It ' s been a pretty good town to be raised in. Ponca has lost and gained several businesses through the last 20 years. It seems the only businesses we gain now are cbd stores, vape shops, and bars. There isn ' t much to do around town for young adults who live modestly. Basically, if you don ' t find a clique to be part of, you ' re not going to enjoy it very much here. Read  26 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I ' ve grown up in this city all my life. It ' s not that big or spectacular. It ' s about 10 by 10 miles both ways, the busiest place in town are the community center and the Walmart. Despite how boring it seems on the surface, I see it as a cute all-american sort of town, Lazy quiet summer nights with lilac skies, crickets and frogs in the distance as the breeze blows by. A huge firework display were the whole town, even others from neighboring towns come to together for free water melon and burgers. The towns asleep by 9 basically. Continuing on the town is still growing, new houses are being built everywhere to accommodate those coming here for the high school. Mustang High school is the 3rd largest in the state. It ' s fairly good, just a bit annoying as to what they decide to spend their money on sometimes. Read  38 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; The people here are very friendly and welcoming. The town is small so everyone knows each other. I have only been living here for 9 months and in that time I have felt nothing but loved. I have been welcomed in homes and made second families. since I am African-American I was skeptical about how this town would accept me because Bixby is mostly white. But this town has exceeded my expectations and I am happy to have been welcomed here. We have small family businesses that are the heart of our town. Everyone lifts each other up. Bixby is the definition of community. So far I have not experienced anything negative, other than the thin, bumpy roads. Overall, bixby is a heartwarming community that has loving, accepting people in it. Read  75 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Vinita has a tight nit community where everyone knows everyone. It ' s a safe place to grow up and great for families. Read  11 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Like small town atmosphere, the ability of drive anywhere within a few minutes, would like to see more job opportunities to grow the population. More job opportunities would attract younger people to live and work here. Read  9 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Nice urban town, not too big, but not too small either. There are many varieties of dining options, but it is lacking in the way of entertainment. If there were more options for entertainment, it would be much better. However, it is home to the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, so it does have a great influx of young college students annually. There is a great community, and there are plenty of church options if someone wants to find a place of worship. Read  22 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; What Ilike about Dewey? Well, first of all, I ' d just like to say that it is a very nice and fair town. Everybody knows everybody in this town, and not to mention everyone is friendly. I really enjoy the many friends in which I have made at Dewey Public Schools. I really enjoy Dewey altogether. Read  2 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; I love the people here and how everyone comes together as a  community. Id likes to see habitat for humanity to come to help us rebuild all the condemned and abandonr=ed houses rebuilt so we can help get a lot of the homeless people off the streets. I believe that you;d help a lot with cleaning up our community and fighting the war against crime, drugs, homelessness, and abandoned pets Read  54 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Being near a national park, we are very in touch with nature. Our small town allows us to enjoy being with one another. I enjoy walking across Sulphur and waving at the occasional jogger or bicyclist. I would certainly like to fix Sulphur ' s traffic laws. Considering that some stop signs are blocked by hanging tree branches. Read  7 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; Tuttle is a small town full of charm. The schools are friendly and are the people who live there. I have lived there for almost 15 years, and it has been a great place to be raised. The town offers local jobs, so I have had the opportunity to work close to my family. It is about 30-45 minitues from Oklahoma City, so that offers more and different choices for a job. Read  17 Reviews Current Resident : &# xA0; The community is great. One of the best school systems with awesome athletic programs. The parks have improved with new playgrounds. One of the good and bad things is they have improved roads in and out of town but the construction traffic is bad.
