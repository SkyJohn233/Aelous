The doctors told me my options were oral drugs, injections and/or surgery. The chiropractor wanted to do a month long treatment of spinal decompression/traction on a very expensive looking machine.  I asked the last doctor (a spine specialist) if it would hurt to try physical therapy; he said it probably wouldn't and could always do the other options later or if the pain became too great. I decided then to go to Chris Kopp of Premier (due to the excellent results I received two years ago after my rotator cuff shoulder surgery.  I met with Chris and began treatment on 9/22/2014. My treatment consisted of light massage/manipulation and a specific exercise regimen at their offices (3Xweek). Today is 10/10/2014 (three weeks later) and I have been discharged from office treatment (other than to continue the specific exercises at home). Other than occasional tingling in my middle finger; I have absolutely no pain and have regained full mobility. I am so grateful that I went to Chris first (vs. taking pills or receiving shots in my neck). Companies below are listed in alphabetical order.
