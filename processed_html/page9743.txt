Even though he s been in the league since 2003 and has won his share of MVPs and NBA Championships, he still hasn t slowed down too noticeably in regards to his performance and is now set on bringing a title to his  hometown  of Cleveland. After that pursuit of the title concludes, though, James has a player option for next season for around $24 million. Given the premise that he s been operating under as of late with opting out and signing a new deal, that s what many can expect LeBron to do this offseason. During the regular season, it appeared like LeBron might actually be on his way out for the Cavaliers given the things he was saying on social media and so son and the way that the season was going in Cleveland. However, that s looking less and less like an actual possibility given what he and his team have done in the postseason. Given that I don t see him even remotely thinking about leaving the Cavs this offseason (or ever again, for that matter), it s safe to say that the Lakers don t have much of a shot at LeBron, even if he has to be considered atop the class of NBA free agents.

With superstars and high draft picks coming into the league year by year, that s just how things work. However, 2016 NBA free agency is a bit more curious than normal given everything around it. < \/p>\n Not only are there some massive names that are either for sure or could possibly be hitting the open market this offseason, but there are also going to be a ton of teams that have an enormous amount of cap space as the salary cap is set to spike as the new TV deal with the league kicks in. That s going to leave plenty of teams with the room to try and sign some of these big-name NBA free agents that will be available. < \/p>\n One team that s going to have that flexibility is going to be the Los Angeles Lakers and it certainly comes at an interesting time. Not only are the Lakers rebuilding in a major way around their young players that they ve drafted over the past few years, but they are also moving into a post-Kobe Bryant era and doing so with over $60 million in room underneath the salary cap this summer. < \/p>\n With the Lakers having those types of moves to make and the ability to really make some noise in free agency, it s important to assess everything that s out there and see how the Lakers factor in. Having that in mind, here s a look at our top 25 NBA free agents for the 2016 offseason and what the chances are that the Lakers sign them. < \/p>\n Next:  < \/span> No. 25 Turner < \/span> < \/a> < \/div>
