phospho-stat3 and -stat5 levels were measured by western blotting and ahr stat3 stat5 receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor x003b3 t ror x003b3 t foxp3 t-cell receptor tcr cd25 il-6r il-10 and il-17 mrna levels were also measured by real-time pcr th17 cells showed a rise and treg cells showed a decrease in the ficz group but revised in the shstat3 group and the naphthoflavone group significant differences were observed in cd25 il-6r il-10 and il-17 mrna levels among different groups stat3 may cooperate with ahr to regulate the differentiation of both th17 and treg cells naive cluster of differentiation cd 4 t cells can differentiate into t helper th cells e.g. th1 th2 and th17 lineages and t regulatory treg cells 1 the former typically expresses interleukin-17 il-17 2 and the latter specifically expresses transcription factor foxp3 3 4 and the x003b1 chain of the il-2 receptor cd25 5 activation of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor x003b3 t ror x003b3 t a transcription factor by il-6 and transforming growth factor x003b2 tgf x003b2 is considered to be critical for the differentiation into th17 cells 6 zhou et al 7 have further reported that il-21 and il-23 pathways are involved in il-6-programmed th-17 cell differentiation abnormal immune response had been proved to be involved in various inflammatory disease 8 thus it is necessary to investigate the differentiation of cd4 t cells into th17 and treg cells the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr is a transcription factor responding to environmental stimuli 9 the activation of ahr can induce various toxic effects such as immune regulation tumor progression and cell differentiation 10 recent study has shown that ahr can regulate the differentiation of cd4 t cells 11 and the differentiation of cd4 t cells into th17 or treg cells depends upon the ligand of ahr 12 similarly quintana et al 13 have also clarified that ahr regulates the differentiation of both treg and th17 cells in a ligand-depending manner in mice namely activation by its ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p -dioxin promotes the differentiation of functional treg cells whereas activation by 6-formylindolo 3,2-b carbazole ficz enhances the differentiation of th17 cells stat3 encodes signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 a member of the stat transcription factor family its involvement in various immune function-related biological processes has been confirmed 14 15 previously stat1 has been reported to negatively regulate the differentiation of inflammatory th17 t cell lineage 16 whereas stat4 or stat6 were not 17 however it is still unclear whether stat3 can influence the differentiation of t cells regulated by ahr in the present study we used ahr agonist ficz and antagonist naphthoflavone to investigate the role of ahr during the differentiation of cd4 t cells into th17 and treg cells and used rna interference to uncover the role of stat3 in this process with the aim to further understand the mechanisms underlying this process the animal experiments were approved by the ethics committee of tongji medical college balb/c mice slac laboratory animals co. ltd

differentiation related cytokines in the control th17 ficz naphthoflavone and shstat3 groups by real-time pcr three in the present study we investigated the role of ahr and stat3 during the differentiation of cd4 t cells into th17 and treg cells here either th17 cells percentage was increased whereas treg cells percentage was decreased in the group treated with ahr agonist ficz especially the th17 cells proportion indicating that ahr activation greatly accelerates the differentiation of th17 cells as either cell proportion was decreased when ahr antagonist naphthoflavone was used to treat cd4 t cells indicating that ahr activation is necessary for the differentiation of both cells which agrees with most previous findings veldhoen et al 19 20 have confirmed that ahr promotes the differentiation of th17 cells apetoh et al 21 have also reported that ahr is in synergy with c-maf in promoting the development of type 1 treg cells however quintana et al 13 have implied a more complex role of ahr during this differentiation process they found that when ahr was activated by its ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin the differentiation of functional treg cells was promoted whereas when activated by ficz treg cell development was suppressed and th17 cell differentiation was enhanced as the roles of different ahr ligands were not explored here we preliminarily concluded that ahr activation is necessary for the differentiation of th17 cells noticeably when the gene stat3 in cd4 t cells was knockdown by rna interference method in the group treated with ahr agonist ficz the percentage of either th17 cells showed a sharp decrease whereas treg cells showed a significant increase as compared to the ficz group indicating that this gene is indispensable for the functioning of ahr in the differentiation of cd4 t cells the case was similar in the naphthoflavone group this gene has been assumed to have a role in il-27-mediated proliferation of cd4 t cells 22 additionally it has been reported to be activated by il-6r/gp130 to exert a proinflammatory effect and by il-10r to exert an anti-inflammatory effect 23 here il-6r had a significantly higher level in the shstat3 group and naphthoflavone group however no significant differences were observed in stat3 mrna levels among different groups thus the relationship between stat3 and il-6r is unclear further western blotting showed higher phospho-stat3 levels in the th17 and ficz groups compared with the control group as well as lower phospho-stat3 levels in the naphthoflavone group and shstat3 group especially in the shstat3 group confirming the importance of phospho-stat3 in the differentiation of cd4 t cells as there was an opposite trend in the concentration between phospho-stat3 and phospho-stat5 levels taken together stat3 may cooperate with ahr to regulate the differentiation of th17 and treg cells however the mrna levels of various interleukin and other factors showed no significant differences among different groups thus it is hard to estimate their roles in this process which should be further addressed abbreviations ahr aryl hydrocarbon receptor cd cluster of
