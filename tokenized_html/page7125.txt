menopause lying down they turned it into a pop-culture phenomenon — and a billion-dollar business what was once shrouded in shame and mystery became a source of sassy celebration soon after the first boomers reached menopause in the 1990s instead of suffering in silence women in this generation turned out to see menopause the musical or watched tv shows like hulu 's the hot flashes they listened as oprah winfrey and suzanne somers openly detailed their menopausal journeys on talk shows and just as boomers took control of their sexual health with the pill and then transformed childbirth they 've taken charge of their care in menopause the phase marking the end of a woman 's ability to bear children they expected their physicians to offer relief and if that did n't work they turned to alternative practitioners or specialty clinics in 2017 the youngest boomer women turn 53 two years past the average age of the onset of menopause the next generation of women is inheriting a vastly different landscape dr. joann v. pinkerton is executive director of the north american menopause society women are researching menopause and they 're talking about it says dr. joann v. pinkerton executive director of the north american menopause society boomers grew up with the book our bodies ourselves which urged women to look for answers they want to know that their problems can be improved or fixed that 's how deborah simmons 61 approached menopause when she first noticed symptoms several years ago hot flashes and night sweats were mostly an annoyance but then she started having difficulty concentrating at the time she was a practicing attorney and that was n't acceptable i felt like i had attention deficit disorder she says i was n't able to have sustained focus on complicated reading and i could n't process the content the way that i needed to do simmons reviewed medical studies online and then discussed treatment with her doctor who recommended a low-dose estrogen patch within days the problems resolved determined to minimize any cancer risk simmons weaned off the patch with her doctor 's guidance after a few months when she started having trouble focusing again eight months later she resumed the patch for three months then stopped again and has n't had problems since simmons sees a sharp contrast in her experience with that of her mother 's generation they did not have choices about managing menopause she says they just had to deal women became partners in their medical decisions pinkerton says today you see ads for products addressing conditions that 30 years ago would n't have even been talked about despite the increased awareness and openness pinkerton says that myths and misinformation still swirl around menopause — much of it related to hormone therapy some physicians stopped prescribing hormones spooked by the results of the women 's health initiative published in 2002 and 2004 which highlighted cancer and heart disease risks but further analysis showed that in the right doses hormones are safe for many women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause hormone therapy is n't an option for women with a history of breast or uterine cancer liver disease blood clots or heart disease to help clear up confusion the north american menopause society will release a physicians statement this summer giving practitioners more specific guidelines for prescribing hormones so that they can more confidently prescribe hormones for women who can safely benefit hormones are now available in topical creams gels and patches which may have lower absorption and thus fewer risks than oral medication the menopause group petitioned the fda to change the warnings on packages of topical estrogen creams which are currently based on studies of oral estrogen the goal is to make sure women are n't missing out on the benefits of hormone therapies because they or their doctors are overestimating the risks for those struggling with symptoms hormones can improve quality of life significantly hormone therapy definitely works for menopausal symptoms and it works quickly says dr. richard kaye medical director of women 's services at texas health plano we need to take away the fear of hormone therapy for women when it 's appropriate says pinkerton women need to understand that loss of estrogen is also a health risk worried about the risks of synthetic hormones — or wanting more aggressive treatment — many boomers looked beyond their primary physicians to manage menopause hormone clinics are popping up in strip malls dispensing testosterone and other hormones to women in menopause as well as men who want to reverse the effects of aging pharmacies and practitioners touting custom-compounded hormone therapies as superior alternatives to fda-approved hormones are burgeoning some clinics market hormones as part of treatment regimens involving multiple visits and tests at a cost of thousands of dollars typically not covered by insurance this is where marketing rears its ugly head says kaye some women think if they have more visits and more blood work they 'll feel better than if they have less intensive therapy but for most it 's not necessary to continue to have hormone levels checked hormone therapy is complex and there 's little data to back many of the claims that custom-compounded hormones are safer or more effective than fda-approved medications but the fact that women have become vocal and proactive patients reflects progress in the past 30 years says karen giblin who founded the red hot mamas a menopause education program we no longer look at menopause as the time when you 're 'over the hill she says we know that there 's going to be 30 more years left that we can live healthy fulfilling lives many patients think hot flashes are the only symptom of menopause but menopausal women may also experience sleep disturbances headache mood swings forgetfulness difficulty concentrating depression or anxiety loss of libido painful intercourse vaginal dryness or incontinence lifestyle changes hormone therapy and other treatments can help with these issues many do n't want to talk to their doctors about these symptoms either because they 're too embarrassed or assume there is no fix pinkerton says yet there 's help available many internists and general practitioners do n't get in-depth training in medical school in treating menopausal women or updates as new research becomes available for that reason for the past 10 years the north american menopause society has certified physicians and other practitioners who are versed in menopause-specific medicine and who obtain continuing education in this area to find a practitioner visit https
