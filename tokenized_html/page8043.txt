top 100 teams milb.com history the official site of minor league baseball see all 100 teams by bill weiss marshall wright baseball historians entering the 1925 season the fort worth panthers were riding an impressive streak winners of the last five pennants in a row the panthers had put together a skein at that time nearly unmatched in the annals of professional baseball not yet ready for the good times to end the panthers were about to add a seventh flag to the string helping them on their way as usual was a stable of fine hurlers led by one of the minor league s handful of 300-game winners after winning a smattering of pennants in the first 20 years of the texas league the fort worth club rose to power in the years following world war i in 1919 the team captured the second half pennant making it the only panther team from 1919-1924 to settle for half a loaf in a five-year span beginning in 1920 the team averaged 108 wins a season breezing to both halves of the pennant in each case because fort worth so dominated the texas league in the early 1920s team presidents voted to split the season during the course of the campaign in hopes of derailing the panthers during the second half only in 1923 did the league play a non-split season in 1925 the panthers again were running away with the pennant race and the league directors decided to split the season with the first half ending july 3 the cats had a 54-22 .711 record finishing the half nine games ahead of houston the directors neglected to make any provision for a tie at the end of the second half at first that didn t seem to matter as fort worth was well ahead of second place wichita falls in mid-august with dallas third however the steers put on a late spurt and when the second half concluded dallas was in a dead heat for first with fort worth a meeting was hastily called at which it was decided to play a second half leadership series in which the first team to win three games would be declared the winner of the half if dallas won the series there would be a best-of-five game playoff for the league championship fort worth decided things quickly taking three straight from dallas 5-0 at home 10-3 at dallas and 7-3 at home paul wachtel won two of the three pitching a two-hitter in the opener and beating the steers with only one day s rest in the finale in which he shut out dallas the last seven innings with dallas out of the way the cats beat the atlanta crackers southern association 4 games to 2 in the dixie series the cats were only sixth in the league in batting .292 but they averaged 6-½
