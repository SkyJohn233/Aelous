INDIANAPOLIS (WTHR) - National Night Out is a cross-country event that has been around since the 1980's designed to bring communities and police together to bond and help cut crime. This year, National Night Out celebrations in Indiana will have a little different feel due to the recent deaths of  IMPD Deputy Chief Jim Waters  and  Southport Police Lt. Aaron Allan . Thousands of police departments participate every year, and the Southport Police Department is no different.  "We're going to do a memorial to Lt. Allan," explained Southport Police Chief Thomas Vaughn. "Four years ago when we started, we brought in a dunk tank and that's something Aaron and I have done every year." Lt. Aaron Allan was gunned down in the line of duty on Thursday. Chief Vaughn said it never crossed his mind to cancel National Night Out while his department grieves. "I was telling Aaron's dad I was looking for someone to fill his seat [in the dunk tank] and he said it would be his honor to do that," Chief Vaughn said adding, "I couldn't ask for a better replacement." The police department is located along Derbyshire Road, which will be renamed Lt. Aaron Allan way in honor of the fallen officer. "His wife is amazing. She's a rock and has a lot going on right now. The end of the week is going to be rough for her, but she is strong and has a lot of support including a lot of brothers and sisters she probably didn't realize she had," Chief Vaughn said, speaking about the services which are set for Friday and Saturday. It comes as a memorial continues to grow outside of the police department. "It kind of takes your breath away when you see it. Everyday when I come in it has just grown and grown. What I want the community to know is this is what makes us get up everyday. This is what makes us put the uniform on and want to protect our community," Chief Vaughn said. Support has come all across the region - even across the country. Chief Vaughn shares how a family on vacation from Montana made a detour to stop and pay their respects. Then there’s the story about the 5-year-old boy in Kokomo selling lemonade to benefit the Allan family – both of which has brought him to tears. "Those kind of things just warm your heart and you can't help but to get back up and start walking forward again," he said.
