C-Section Scar Care Basics As a mom, your goal is for your baby to arrive to the world healthy and safe. And if that means it s by C-section, the resulting incision represents a miracle of life   your beautiful baby. Still, it s natural to want to do everything you can to ensure that the resulting wound heals well and scar tissue is minimized. The good news: Most C-section scars heal nicely, resulting in a faint line just above the pubic hair line that's easily covered up by clothing, underwear and bathing suits. During a C-section , your doctor makes two incisions: The first is through the skin of your lower abdomen, about an inch or two above your pubic hair line. The second is into the uterus, which is where the doctor will reach in to deliver your baby. The type of cut on your abdomen may not be the same as the one on your uterus.

If you re still interested in surgical options then, talk to your doctor about whether any of the following options could work for you: Is it normal for the incision to itch?  Itching is very common since the nerves in the area have been disrupted. Avoid scratching. To calm itchy skin, you can apply a minimal amount of OTC sunburn cream to the skin around the scar. Or hold an ice pack (or ice) wrapped in a towel to the area for about five to 10 minutes. Is it normal for it to smell?
