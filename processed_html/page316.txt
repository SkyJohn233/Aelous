Grant Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site T he  chuck box  loaded in the back of the wagon was a honeycomb of drawers and shelves. The larger back partition held sourdough starter, a flour sack and larger utensils. Smaller spaces contained tin plates, 'eatin' irons, "  [utensils] and a 3 - 5 gallon coffee pot. If the weather was cold, the cook often kept the sourdough starter against his body, as it required constant warmth. Heavy pots and pans were stored in a hinged box below the chuck box. A  water barrel  was mounted on the wagon side. It was cooled by wrapping in wet canvas or gunny sack. A  jockey box  beneath the footboard held emergency equipment such as hobbles or horseshoeing tools. The  wagon bed  held other staples and bedrolls. In a large outfit, there was often a separate wagon for bedrolls. A Dutch oven , a cast iron pot with legs and a rimmed lid was essential. It was placed over hot coals. More coals were then piled on the lid. Equally important was the large coffee pot and a couple of kettles. At the campfire,  fire hooks  dangled from the crossbar over the heat for the pots to hang on. The  'gouch' hook  lifted hot and heavy lids. There was a dish pan for mixing bread, a kettle for heating water for washing, a 'wreck' or 'roundup' pan for dirty dishes, and a 'squirrel can' for scraps. Sourdough  was a staple and cooks guarded their dough keg. A typical day's food on the trail was meat, hot bread, dried fruit and coffee for breakfast. The noon and dinner meal included roast beef, boiled potatoes, beans, brown gravy, light bread or biscuits, and coffee.  D essert included stewed dried fruit, spiced cake made without eggs or butter, dried fruit pies, or spotted pup [rice and raisins]. Northern cowboys were more likely to get beef with their meals. Some outfits in the Southwest made do with salt pork, beans and sourdough.
