How to install jstest-gtk on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) Installing jstest-gtk package on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) is as easy as running the following command on terminal:  Advanced Package Tool, or APT, is a free software user interface that works with core libraries to handle the installation and removal of software on Debian, Ubuntu and other Linux distributions. APT simplifies the process of managing software on Unix-like computer systems by automating the retrieval, configuration and installation of software packages, either from precompiled files or by compiling source code.   apt-get is the command-line tool for handling packages, and may be considered the user's "back-end" to other tools using the APT library.   apt-get install is followed by one or more packages desired for installation or upgrading. Each package is a package name, not a fully qualified filename. All packages required by the package(s) specified for installation will also be retrieved and installed. The /etc/apt/sources.list file is used to locate the desired packages. If a hyphen is appended to the package name (with no intervening space), the identified package will be removed if it is installed. Similarly a plus sign can be used to designate a package to install. These latter features may be used to override decisions made by apt-get's conflict resolution system.
