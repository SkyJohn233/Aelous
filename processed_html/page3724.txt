Lubenice is an ancient fort city on the island of Cres, Croatia that was founded approximately four thousand years ago on top of a 380 m high ridge that overlooks the Adriatic Sea. It is a small local center that comprises forty buildings and twenty-four permanent inhabitants. Buildings in the city are constructed out of the same material as the surrounding cliffs and there are two well-preserved extant city gates on the North and South of the city as well a wall in the East. Valun is a village on the Croatian island of Cres. Lake Vrana, in the centre of Cres island, is a fresh water lake, 1.5 km wide and about 7 km long. The town of Cres has been supplied with drinking water from the lake since 1953, and the towns of Mali and Veli Lošinj received their supplies ten years later. It was thought at one time that the water in the lake was linked to some mainland source by underground streams, but it has since been established that in fact it originates from the atmosphere.
