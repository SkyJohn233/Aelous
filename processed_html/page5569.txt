Samples of this alloy were obtained using the blended elemental technique from hydrided powders. The isochronal sintering of the compacts for 2 h was carried out in the range 900–1,400 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C min −1 . In this work, the behavior of the elementary powders during sintering and the corresponding microstructural evolution were investigated. The alloy was characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in the backscattered mode, X-ray diffraction, and density measurements. The results indicate that the homogenization of the alloy is diffusion-controlled. With increasing temperature, homogenization of the alloy takes place and a fine plate-like α + β structure is found throughout the microstructure in temperatures above 1,300 °C. The process variables were defined aiming to minimize interstitial pick-up (C, O, and N) and avoiding intensive grain growth. Titanium and its alloys have become one of the most attractive classes of biomedical implant materials. They are generally preferred to stainless steels and Co–Cr alloys because of their low density, superior biocompatibility and corrosion resistance, good mechanical properties, and low-elastic modulus [ 1 ,  2 ,  3 ]. The first generation orthopedic α + β titanium alloys such as Ti–6Al–4V ELI (extra low interstitial), Ti–6Al–7Nb and Ti–5Al–2.5Fe are already in use. In recent years, second generation low-modulus near β and β type titanium alloys have been developed for orthopedic applications in order to avoid the “stress shielding” effect caused by the modulus mismatch between the implant and the bone [ 4 ,  5 ,  6 ]. Ti–13Nb–13Zr is a near β alloy formulated at the beginning of the 1990s to be used in orthopedic applications due to its low Young’s modulus (40–80 GPa) and its non-toxic composition. It presents tensile values of approximately 1,300 MPa and a superior corrosion resistance when compared to Ti–6Al–4V and Ti–6Al–7Nb alloys [ 7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ]. Ti–13Nb–13Zr has niobium as a beta-phase stabilizer. The other alloying element, zirconium, is isomorphous with both the alpha and beta phases of titanium. A combination of these two alloying elements has made it possible to develop a structure that is a “near” beta phase supposedly possessing a superior corrosion resistance over the alpha–beta phase alloys, with enough alpha phase present in the final structure to provide the necessary mechanical strength. It has been proposed that Ti–13Nb–13Zr alloy is more favorable for orthopedic implants than Ti–6Al–4V alloy because of its superior corrosion resistance and biocompatibility [ 11 ,  12 ,  13 ]. Reasons for this superiority have included the fact that less metal ion release is likely to occur during spontaneous passivation of Ti–13Nb–13Zr alloy because the corrosion products of the minor alloying elements, niobium and zirconium, are less soluble than those of aluminum and vanadium. Also, that the passive oxide layer on the surface of the alloy is more inert consisting of a dense rutile structure providing greater protection to the underlying alloy [ 14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ]. The machining cost of titanium alloys is very high. The powder metallurgy (P/M) process is a near-net-shape process, and therefore, effective in the reduction of the machining cost of titanium alloys [ 18 ]. The P/M process is also advantageous to fabricate alloys, which are difficult to fabricate through the ingot melting (IM) process. The possibility of hot isostatic pressing or forging applied after sintering reduces the residual porosity. Metal injection molding (MIM) is also applicable to fabricate titanium alloys for biomedical applications [ 19 ]. Recent low-modulus titanium alloys for biomedical applications (such as Ti–13Nb–13Zr and Ti–35Nb–7Zr–5Ta) contain a large amount of alloying elements with much higher melting temperatures and density, such as Nb and Ta compared with Ti. In these cases, the P/M process is also advantageous to make homogeneous alloys [ 20 ,  21 ,  22 ,  23 ]. The mechanical properties of Ti–29Nb–13Ta–4.6Zr fabricated through the IM process and P/M process are equivalent to those of Ti–29Nb–13Ta–4.6Zr, although 0.2% proof stress is lower in PM alloys than in IM alloys [ 2 ]. Reactive plasma spraying (RPS) from titanium powders for protective coatings have been used in industrial area in recent years [ 24 ]. The blended elemental (BE) approach is potentially the lowest cost titanium P/M process available. Unfortunately, parts are limited in size and complexity, as well as less than 100% of theoretical density, which would adversely affect mechanical properties. Recent developments, such as using hydrided powders, have enabled the fabrication of BE parts to over 99% of full density, resulting in significantly improved properties. Further studies and developments show that this approach may be well suited to reduce the cost of producing industrial parts making titanium more cost competitive with other materials commonly used in many applications [ 25 ,  26 ,  27 ,  28 ]. A significant influence on mechanical behavior of commercial pure (CP) titanium is brought about by hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen, which dissolves interstitially in titanium and have a potent effect on mechanical properties. These effects are carried over to titanium alloys in varying degrees [ 29 ]. Interstitial elements are those elements that are significantly smaller than the titanium atom and can be dissolved in the titanium crystal lattice as solid solutions without substituting the titanium atom sites [ 30 ]. The aim of this article is to investigate the microstructural evolution and the behavior of the hydrided powders during sintering in order to determine the influence of the key process variables on the microstructure of this alloy for an efficient and safe application in surgical implants. The BE method followed by a sequence of uniaxial and cold isostatic pressing with subsequent densification by sintering was used for the preparation of the Ti–13Nb–13Zr samples.

After blending, powders were cold uniaxially pressed at 80 MPa, in cylindrical 15 mm diameter steel die without lubricants. Afterward, the green compacts were encapsulated under vacuum in flexible latex molds and cold isostatically pressed at 350 MPa during 30 s aiming to increase their green density. Sintering was carried out in niobium crucible, under high vacuum condition (10 −7  Torr), using a Thermal Technology Inc. model Astro 1000 equipment. Sintering temperatures ranged between 900 and 1,400 °C with a heating rate equal to 20 °C/min. After reaching the nominal temperature, samples were hold at the chosen temperature for 2 h and then furnace-cooled to room temperature. Metallographic preparation was carried out using conventional techniques. Specimens were etched with a Kroll solution: (3 mL HF:6 mL HNO 3 :100 mL H 2 O) to reveal its microstructure. The micrographs were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) LEO model 435 Vpi, in the backscattered mode (BSE) to stress composition contrast. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using Cu-Kα radiation at 30 kV (Rich-Seifert). Sintered densities were determined by water immersion method. The chemical composition of the sintered samples was determined by atomic emission plasma spectrometry with an ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) equipment, using ASTM E2371-04 pattern. Chemical composition of the constituent phases in terms of Ti, Nb, and Zr was determined using standardless semi-quantitative EDS analyses in the SEM. Oxygen and nitrogen were determined by the inert gas fusion technique using a LECO TC500 equipment. Carbon was determined by combustion-infrared spectrophotometry. Sampling for chemical analyses was performed in the central region of the sintered compacts. Microhardness measurements were carried out in a Micromet 2004 equipment, Buehler, with load of 0.2 kgf. The expansion/contraction behavior of a Ti–13Nb–13Zr compact during sintering was examined by a dilatometer, where a green compact with a 6 mm diameter and a 15 mm length was heated in the same sintering conditions at 1,400 °C, using hydrided and dehydrided powders. Classical 4 point flexion test were performed in samples sintered at 1,400 °C in order to estimate the mechanical properties. The samples presented high densification, varying between 69 and 71% of the theoretical density, after cold isostatic pressing and, between 93 and 97%, after sintering at 1,400 °C, with homogeneous microstructure.

Dotted line  indicates the theoretical density of the alloy The microstructural analysis shows that a Widmanstätten-like microstructure grows with the dissolution of the niobium particles from increasing of the sintering temperature. Microstructural evolution of the BE–Ti–13Nb–13Zr during sintering. All samples were sintered at the nominal temperature for 2 h and heating rate equal to 20 °C min −1 For specimens sintered at 900 °C, the microstructure consists of angular titanium particles (gray contrast) resembling their original morphology and niobium particles (brighter ones). Similar behavior has been also observed during heating of BE–Ti–6Al–7Nb compacts [ 19 ]. The dissolution of niobium particles becomes evident. The former angular-shaped niobium particles become rounded and their size decreased with time. The boundaries between the angular Ti and Nb particles become diffuse. The dissolution of zirconium particles in both α and β areas is fast with the temperature increase (being completely dissolved in temperatures above 1,000 °C). Furthermore, the first two-phase areas resembling a Widmanstätten structure become distinguishable. These areas consist of a pure niobium core (a strong β-stabilizer in titanium alloys) surrounded by a two-phase microstructure. With increasing sintering temperature, the dissolution of the niobium particles continues with consequent increase in the volume fraction of the two-phase structure. The dissolution of niobium particles is very fast and at 1,000 °C, there are few regions without a two-phase microstructure. In the temperature range 1,000–1,300 °C, the most noticeable microstructural features are the spreading of the α + β structure and the chemical homogenization of the alloy. At 1,300 °C, the larger niobium particles present in the initial powder size distribution are found almost dissolved in the core of the Widmanstätten-like structure, whereas the finer ones have vanished in the microstructure. The specimens of the Ti–13Nb–13Zr alloy sintered at high temperatures (≥1,400 °C) display a fine plate-like alpha plus beta structure with alpha on grain boundary. Individual niobium areas are found completely dissolved. A few remaining pores are still found and density above 90% is observed. From 1,400 °C, a homogeneous microstructure is obtained and the chemical composition is reasonably homogeneous throughout the microstructure (at SEM resolution level). It does not exclude the possibility of very fine particles in the nanometer-range coexist in the microstructure. The samples presented hardness values around 300 HV, near the observed in samples produced by the conventional methods (melting and forging) [ 8 ]. Microstructure of Ti–13Nb–13Zr sample sintered at 1,100 °C presenting areas with niobium particle agglomerations Results of ICP analyses reveal no appreciable changes in terms of Ti, Zr, and Nb contents during sintering of this alloy. The nominal composition was kept nearly unchanged even in specimens sintered at 1,400 °C for 2 h. An advantage of P/M lies on the efficiency of the chemical composition control. A slight decrease in the final Zr content was observed lying close to 12.8 wt% (12.5–14% is the range specified in ASTM F1713).

The EDS analyses in the β-phase were performed in regions larger than 1 μm in width to avoid matrix interference. The volume fraction of β phase measured in this alloy is about 10%. The EDS results indicate superior niobium content in β-phase, due to its power of preferential stabilization of this phase. Zirconium is capable of stabilizing both α- and β-phase titanium alloy, but act by being in solution in the alloy as a β-stabilizer alloy (15.26% in β-phase). It is further believed that the larger ionic radius of zirconium (35% larger than that of titanium) helps to disrupt ionic bonding forces in the alloy resulting in some reduction in the modulus of elasticity [ 8 ].

This structure grows with the dissolution of the Nb particles by the increase of the sintering temperature. A total homogeneous structure is only obtained after the complete dissolution of all the Nb particles; (e) The dilatometric analysis show that the alloy processing from hydrided powders is more efficient due to the acceleration of the sintering mechanisms; (f) The mechanical properties indicate that the strength is dependent on density; (g) The O pick-up is mainly related to the absorption during the hydriding and blending stages; and (h) The combination of relatively low-cost powders, compaction techniques in a mass production scale, vacuum sintering, minimal machining, and good mechanical properties can provide P/M Ti–13Nb–13Zr parts more attractive for surgical implants.
