party involved in the case sent an email to a local television wfla news station that also questioned the bullying claims this narrative is untrue and not based on credible facts and is their opinion only the cyber bullying angle to this story is not based on facts. breaking it down whether this was bullying or not is a question for investigators there is no doubt that the video was loaded up on snapchat by someone we may never know who but there is a bigger problem here we must deal with and that is the power of social media in the wrong hands we need to make sure our children understand the how incredibly dangerous social media and the internet is it is no trivial matter when our children begin killing themselves when they learn how exposed they have become using the internet it is no trivial matter when social media persuades people to commit crimes and even murder we must teach our children the power of this new media nothing is ever deleted from the internet and we must heed the old cliche whats done in the dark will come to light young people are discovering that their facebook pages and twitter feed are having an impact on their life far in the future in tovanna s case she learned horribly fast that social media can tear a life apart sadly this not an isolated incident people do this sort thing everyday because they simply lack the understanding of what the internet and sites like snapchat can do to them we can not continue to just hand our children computers tablets and smartphones and ignore the continued responsibility that go along with it this is an educational issue that is beginning to look like a public health issue you would not hand a child a gun to play with would you so why would anyone hand a child a device that connects to the internet when we know that there are extreme dangers waiting for them online right now there are pedophiles scam artists and even killers surfing the internet looking for their next victim parents need to be as cautious when handing a child a computer as they would handing them the keys to the car african american bay area tech black cyber bullying daily beast facebook snapchat social media suicide tovonna holton
