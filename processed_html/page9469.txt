Midpoint of a Line Segment Here the point  (12,5)  is 12 units along, and 5 units up We can use  Cartesian Coordinates   to locate a  point  by  how far along  and  how far up  it is: And when we know  both end points  of a  line segment  we can find the  midpoint  " M "   (try dragging the blue circles): The midpoint is halfway  between the two end points: To calculate it:  As a formula: M = ( x A +x B 2 , y A +y B 2 ) Use the formula: M = (  x A +x B 2 ,  y A +y B 2  ) M = (  ( 3)+8 2 ,  5+( 1) 2  ) M = ( 5/2, 4/2 ) M = ( 2.5, 2 )
