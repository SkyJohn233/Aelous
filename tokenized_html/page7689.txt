composite materials to reduce weight and increase maneuverability this composite material strength allows military drones to cruise at extremely high altitudes drones are equipped with different state of the art technology such as infrared cameras gps and laser consumer commercial and military uav drones are controlled by remote ground control systems gsc and also referred to as a ground cockpit an unmanned aerial vehicle system has two parts the drone itself and the control system the nose of the unmanned aerial vehicle is where all the sensors and navigational systems are present the rest of the body is full of drone technology systems since there is no space required to accommodate humans the engineering materials used to build the drone are highly complex composites designed to absorb vibration which decrease the sound produced these materials are very light weight below we examine the science and drone technology behind the dji phantom 3 uav we also have plenty of information on the latest drone technologies from the newest drones on the market there are plenty of links where you can read deeper into various components of drone technology for example here is a terrific drone components overview article this gives information on the individual components seen in most drones drones come in a wide variety of sizes with the largest being mostly used for military purposes such as the predator drone the next in size are unmanned aircraft which have fixed wings and require short runways these are generally used to cover large sections of land working in areas such as geographical surveying or to combat wildlife poaching next in size for drones are what is known as vtol drones these are generally quadcopters but not all vtol drones can take off fly hover and land vertically the exact meaning of vtol is vertical take-off and landing a few of the latest small drones such as the dji mavic air and dji spark take vtol to the next level and can be launched from the palm of your hand the latest drones have dual global navigational satellite systems gnss such as gps and glonass drones can fly in both gnss and non satellite modes for example dji drones can fly in p-mode gps glonass or atti mode which doesn t use gps highly accurate drone navigation is very important when flying especially in drone applications such as creating 3d maps surveying landscape and sar search rescue missions when the quadcopter is first switched on it searches and detects gnss satellites high end gnss systems use satellite constellation technology basically a satellite constellation is a group of satellites working together giving coordinated coverage and synchronized so that they overlap well in coverage pass or coverage is the period in which a satellite is visible above the local horizon the radar technology will signal the following on the remote controller display most of the latest drone have 3 types of return to home drone technology as follows the latest mavic air rth technology can sense obstacles during automatic return to home the latest high tech drones are now equipped with collision avoidance systems these use obstacle detection sensors to scan the surroundings while software algorithms and slam technology produce the images into 3d maps allowing the drone to sense and avoid these systems fuse one or more of the following sensors to sense and avoid the latest dji mavic 2 pro and mavic 2 zoom have obstacle sensing on all 6 sides the mavic 2 uses both vision and infrared sensors fused into a vision system known as omni-directional obstacle sensing the dji mavic 2 obstacle sensing system is top drone technology the mavic 2 will sense objects then fly around obstacles in front it can do the same when flying backwards or hover if it is not possible to fly around the obstacle this technology is known as apas advanced pilot assistance system on the dji mavic 2 and mavic air drones gyros stabilization technology give the drone its smooth flight capabilities the gyroscope works almost instantly to the forces moving against the drone keeping it flying or hovering very smoothly the gyroscope provides essential navigational information to the central flight controller the inertial measurement unit imu works by detecting the current rate of acceleration using one or more accelerometers the imu detects changes in rotational attributes like pitch roll and yaw using one or more gyroscopes some imu include a magnetometer to assist with calibration against orientation drift the gyroscope is a component of the imu and the imu is an essential component of the drones flight controller the flight controller is the central brain of the drone here is a terrific article which covers gyro stabilization and imu technology in drones the motors and propellers are the drone technology which move the uav into the air and to fly in any direction or hover on a quadcopter the motors and propellers work in pairs with 2 motors propellers rotating clockwise cw propellers and 2 motors rotating counter clockwise ccw propellers they receive data from the flight controller and the electronic speed controllers esc on the drone motor direction to either hover or fly nearly all drones have a ground station controller gsc or an smartphone app allowing you to keep track of the current flight telemetry and see what your drone sees on your mobile device in order to increase flight safety and prevent accidents in restricted areas the latest drones from dji and other manufacturers include a no fly zone feature the no fly zones are regulated and categorized by the federal aviation authority faa manufacturers can change the no fly zone drone technology using uav firmware updates when the compass is calibrated it then seeks the location of gps satellites when more than 6 are found it allows the drone to fly in ready to fly mode allows the uav and remote control system to know exactly its flight location a home point can be set and this is the location the drone will return to if the drone and the remote control system stop connecting this is also known as fail-safe function fpv means first person view a video camera is mounted on the unmanned aerial vehicle and this camera broadcasts the live video to the pilot on the ground the ground pilot is flying the aircraft as if they were on-board the aircraft instead of looking at the aircraft from the pilot s actual ground position fpv allows the unmanned aircraft to fly much higher and further than you can from looking at the aircraft from the ground first person view allows for more precise flying especially around obstacles fpv allows unmanned aerial vehicles to fly very easily indoors or through forests and around buildings the exceptionally fast growth and development of the drone racing league would not be possible without fpv live video transmission technology this fpv technology uses radio signal to transmit and receive the live video the drone has a multi-band wireless fpv transmitter built in along with an antenna depending on the drone the receiver of the live video signals can be either the remote control unit a computer tablet or smartphone device this live video feed is related to the strength of the signal between the ground control on the drone the latest dji mavic 2 has an fpv live video range of 5 miles 8 km with a 1080p quality video transmission other slightly older drones such as the dji mavic and phantom 4 pro can transmit live video up to 4.3 miles 7 km the phantom 4 pro and inspire 2 use the
