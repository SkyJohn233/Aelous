Mildenhall Glacier - Review of Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center, Juneau, AK - TripAdvisor Enjoyed seeing this from the ship. There are air trips that go beyond the glacier, flying over the fjord. The blue hues coming through the glacier make it quite stunning Easy walk to glacier. Beautiful hike with amazing photo ops. Free to public. Museum too crowded but hike was relaxing. Must see! We went from a cruise ship by bus to the heliport where we watched a short safety movie. Then we flew the helicopter with some amazing views and great pilots who showed and told us many things about the glacier and Mountains. The dog camp was awesome. Being able to pet the dogs was really fun. The mushers are really nice and enjoy answering every question.  ><br >This trip is kinda pricy tho but it is worth every penny. If you can afford it do it. You might be there only once in a lifetime.  The place is packed full of educational material.,the Forest Rangers are knowledgeable and helpful. The movie was very moving. The glacier was beautiful. They have many walking trails depending on the ability of the hiker. The Rangers gave wonderful talks and a excellent movie. We only stopped by for a short visit, but the views were spectacular.  Being fairly early on a rainy Sunday in early May, we were just about the only ones there.
