July 10, 2017 Last modified on December 13th, 2018 Once upon a time, Cami (original creator of the blog TIDBITS and also my very talented sister) approached me about creating an  Electric Pressure Cooker Cookbook  together, and now a year and a half later, I'm jumping head first into running a food blog! Â I am 100% a girl that craves predictability and control over every possible situation so this is completely exciting, terrifying, and exhilarating all at the same time. Â I no longer know who I am, how I got here, or where my new adventure is going to take me, but I've gotta admit, I'm kinda liking it! So here is your personal welcome to join me in my new journey! Â I've got a tattered, food stained notebook full of recipes that I'm just dying to get into your homes. Â My brain is going non-stop imagining and planning all the things I want to be incorporated on this here blog, but here's a taste of what to expect- 1  Â  FOOD!  Â Obviously, right? Â More specifically I want to feel your homes with my families favorite recipes, my crazy ideas (remember the pressure cookerÂ  vanilla extractÂ   I've got more where that came from!), lots of pressure cooking recipes featuring my favorite electric pressure cookers  Â  Instant Pot  and  Fagor Lux Multicooker , lots of whole grains, lots of naturally sweetened desserts, and of course the occasional  over the top dessert  so my kids never forget I'm their favorite mommy chef. 2  Â  My life is all about family. Â I find great happiness in being with my family and refer to these bits of pure joy as the  The Good Life . Â I'm so passionate about this, I've dedicated an entire section of my blog to it, and I can't wait to start filling it up! 3 -In the short 13 years I knew my father on earth, I learned to crave knowledge and learning from his intense example. Â My desire to learn a subject to the max can on one hand be a curse, the other hand a blessing, but regardless of what it is, it is always an opportunity to share with others what I've learned. Â I'll be referring to this in a little section I'm calling  Healthy Living . Â It's ever evolving of course, but I am anxious to get these life lessons into your hands! So here we go! Â There are so many empty spaces on my new blog that I'm just dying to fill up. Â I've got so much to learn and feel like I need to do it all by tomorrow! Â I start everyday with a mile long checklist and go to bed each night with a dose of reality as I realize I'm a wife, a mama, a daughter, and a Nurse Practitioner and can only do so much. Â So have patience with me! Â I owe so much to my sister Cami for bringing me along on this adventure. Â It makes it all the better to be doing it with her and I can't wait to see what my future holds. Â What more can I say? Â Let's do this! For a more in-depth explanation of the How, What, When, Where, and Why of the new face of TIDBITS, click  here  to read all about it from Cami. If you're new to my face and my history, you can read a bit more about me  here . Nancy says July 16, 2017 This sounds a wonderful venture for you. Looking forward to reading what you have to off.
