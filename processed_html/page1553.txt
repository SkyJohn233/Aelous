Hello, I use the latest version of Onenote for iPad and I would like to mute the camera while taking a photo on Onenote. Note that currently I am not able to do it even if my iPad is in mute mode! Another question which is fundamental, when I write my notes and afterwards draw something, usually what I have drawn overlaps with what I have written before, is there a way to avoid it? Thanks in advance for your help. Hi Ferdinando, For question 1: The camera in OneNote  is the camera in iPad. For your reference: Please check if the Camera application of iPad will make sound when you take photos after you set mute mode on iPad. If yes, we suggest you contact  Apple support  for further troubleshooting. Meanwhile, you can refer to this thread  How to turn off camera sound???

Thanks for your feedback. Amazing, it works now. Should you be able to solve also my other issue about distorted drawing, it would be fantastic. Actually I would like to write and draw on the same box, being able to make changes later without making a mess. Also if I need to view what I have written on a different device, I need my drawing to be kept like they are and not distorted or moved. Thank you. Did this solve your problem ?

I suggest you use  Lasso Select  to select and move the drawing and use Text Mode  to split the text from overwritten drawing. Thanks for your understanding.
