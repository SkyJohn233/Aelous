and colleagues learn more share a link this standard describes a diagnostic protocol for pantoea stewartii subsp stewartii approved in 2005‐09 revised in 2016‐04 pantoea stewartii subsp stewartii is indigenous to the americas and has been introduced to other parts of the world with maize seeds it causes a disease called stewart 's wilt the principal host is zea mays maize especially sweet corn but dent flint flour and pop corn cultivars can also be infected in the americas chaetocnema pulicaria melsheimer coleoptera chrysomelidae is the only known efficient vector and the main overwintering site of the bacterium asymptomatic infection of maize with p. stewartii subsp stewartii is not known to occur pantoea stewartii subsp stewartii may be transmitted in seed and has occasionally been found to be able to overwinter in soil manure or maize stalks however these means of survival are of little importance compared with the insect vectors which harbour the pathogen during their overwintering period and transfer the bacterium from one plant to another during the growing season further information on the biology distribution and economic importance of the disease is provided by eppo/cabi 1997 and in the eppo global database eppo 2016 a flow diagram describing the diagnostic procedure for p. stewartii subsp stewartii is presented in fig 1 name pantoea stewartii subsp stewartii smith 1898 mergaert et al 1993 synonyms erwinia stewartii smith 1898 dye 1963 xanthomonas stewartii smith 1898 dowson 1939 taxonomic position bacteria proteobacteria gammaproteobacteria enterobacteriales enterobacteriacae eppo code erwist phytosanitary categorization eppo a2 list no 54 eu annex ii/a1 the bacterium may be found on/in seeds of maize no characteristic symptoms are visible on infected seeds in maize plants the first phase of the disease which may affect the plants at the seedling stage is wilting the bacterium spreads systemically through the vascular system if infected during a late growth stage plants may reach a reasonable size leaves develop pale‐green to yellow longitudinal streaks with irregular or wavy margins which are parallel to the veins and may extend for the length of the leaf fig 2 other pictures can be seen in the eppo global database https //gd.eppo.int/taxon/erwist/photos these streaks dry out and turn brown small water‐soaked spots may develop on the husk of the cobs bacteria may exude in fine yellowish droplets on the inner face of the husk plants that are not killed may produce bleached dead tassels cavities may appear close to the soil in the stalk pith of severely infected plants pantoea stewartii subsp stewartii is able to penetrate the seed through wounds and via the xylem and causes infection under the seed coat but is not able to enter the embryo sweet corn is particularly susceptible to seed infection field and dent corn are more susceptible to another phase namely leaf blight usually most apparent after tasselling short to long irregular pale‐green to yellow streaks which originate from feeding marks of the corn flea beetle chaetocnema pulicaria appear along the veins of leaves whole leaves sometimes become straw‐coloured and die diseased and weakened plants are more susceptible to fungal stalk rots the disease may be confused with other leaf blights five to ten leaves cobs and/or tassels with typical symptoms are collected from the inspected plot field for laboratory examination seed‐to‐seedling transmission of p. stewartii subsp stewartii may occur at low rates in seed lots with 1 kernel infection pataky ikin 2003 for seed lots the usually recommended sample size is 400 seeds per lot corresponding to a 95 probability of detecting an infestation level of 1 plant parts leaf husk tassel showing symptoms are surface sterilized in 70 ethanol for 5–10 s rinsed with sterile water and excised at the leading edge of the lesions plant parts are then macerated in a plastic bag with a hand homogeniser or in a mortar with a pestle with a few millilitres of sterile phosphate buffer pb or comminuted lightly ground in a sterile petri dish with sterile pb an appropriate aliquot of the extract is transferred into a tube to be used in immunofluorescence if staining the remaining part of the extract is collected in sterile disposable plastic tubes and used immediately and/or stored at approximately 4–10°c or on ice for future use/reference purposes for samples showing symptoms direct isolation should be performed immediately after maceration the 400‐seed sample is divided into subsamples of up to 100 seeds each and put into plastic bags seeds treated with any plant protection product should be washed under running tap water until the water runs clear to remove product from the seed surface in such cases the report should mention that the seeds were treated sterile pb equal to twice the seed weight is added to the subsamples and the bag is then closed the subsamples are incubated in refrigerator at 4–10°c overnight after incubation the soaked seeds are shaken on a rotary shaker at room temperature for at least 1 h at approximately 200 r.p.m the soaking liquid from seeds is centrifuged at approximately 10 000 g for approximately 10 min at 4–10°c the pellet is resuspended in 1/10 of the original liquid volume of sterile pb and collected in sterile disposable plastic tubes for further testing and stored at approximately 4–10°c or on ice macerates should be used immediately if at room temperature or within 24 h if stored at 4–10°c although it is not recommended macerates may be stored below −18°c with 10–30 glycerol for several weeks for further testing but isolation can be impaired if and real‐time pcr have been evaluated in the framework of a euphresco project euphresco 2010 unpublished report and are recommended for use as screening tests the conventional pcr test pcr a with ages primers presented in appendix 3 has been used in one laboratory for testing seed extracts but can not be recommended as a screening test without further laboratory validation the plant and seed extracts and their 10× and 100× dilutions in pb are used for indirect if staining indirect if staining is preferably done using specific monoclonal antibodies those from linaris dossenheim de showed the best performance in the euphresco test performance study euphresco 2010 unpublished report the if test procedure is described in pm 7/97 indirect immunofluorescence test for plant pathogenic bacteria eppo 2009 specific information on polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies that can be used and the performance criteria obtained using these antibodies are included in appendix 2 the pathogen can be detected by real‐time pcr performed on the macerates obtained from symptomatic plant parts or after soaking of seeds tambong et al 2008 the test is described in appendix 4 as the number of viable cells decreases quickly in macerates isolation should be done within 24 h. for longer preservation the suspension should be stored below −18°c with 10–30 glycerol but this extended storage may impair isolation the suspensions from symptomatic plant material and seed extracts are serially diluted in 10‐fold steps up to 1:10 000 in pb see appendix 1 one hundred microlitres of each dilution is spread over the surface on at least one of the following media king 's b supplemented nutrient‐broth yeast extract agar nby and/or yeast peptone glucose agar ypga see appendix 1 plates are incubated at approximately 25–27°c and examined after 2–5 days for typical colonies of p. stewartii subsp stewartii one to five isolated colonies with typical morphology are used for further analysis final reading of the plates should be done after 5 days colonies are lemon to orange‐yellow or pale‐yellow flat to convex transparent with entire edges and slow growing on king 's b agar strains developing colonies with a different appearance have been observed fig 3 a the cells are gram‐negative straight short rods 0.4–0.7 × 0.9–1.7 μm when if is performed on colonies see section 4 colonies should be cultured on ypga or subcultured on nutrient agar na if pictures are shown in fig 4 some laboratories also use a slide agglutination test using their own polyclonal antiserum identification of pure cultures of presumptive p. stewartii subsp stewartii isolates should be carried out using at least two tests based on different biological principles the recommended tests are indicated below a suspension prepared from 1–3‐day‐old bacterial growth of presumptive p. stewartii subsp stewartii isolates on na or ypga is used for indirect if staining using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies the procedure for the if test is described in pm 7/97 indirect immunofluorescence test for plant pathogenic bacteria eppo 2009 specific information on polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies that can be used and performance criteria obtained using these antibodies are included in appendix 2 an elisa test for presumptive p. stewartii subsp stewartii isolates can be performed using a kit from agdia elkhart us following the supplier 's instructions detailed instructions are provided in pm 7/101 elisa tests for plant pathogenic bacteria eppo 2010b two conventional pcr test and a real‐time pcr test are described in appendices 3 and 4 because of the low sensitivity of the conventional pcr test described in appendix 4 ≤10 7 cfu ml –1 a sufficient amount of pure culture should be produced analysis of chromosomal dna can be performed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis pfge as described by zhang geider 1997 or by rep‐pcr following louws et al 1994 detailed instructions for rep‐pcr are provided in pm 7/100 rep‐pcr tests for identification of bacteria eppo 2010a multilocus sequence analysis brady et al 2008 based on partial sequences of the gyrb rpob atpd and infb genes have been used to differentiate p. stewartii subsp stewartii from the other species of the genus pantoea pantoea stewartii subsp stewartii can be distinguished from its close relative subsp indologenes although sequence similarity between the subspecies is high e.g up to 99 for gyrb fatty acid analysis is carried out using the midi system newark us and agilent equipment as described by janse 1991 and stead et al 1992 morphological and biochemical tests the morphological and biochemical properties of p. stewartii subsp stewartii isolates are as listed in table 1 in critical cases when a positive result is obtained confirmation by pathogenicity test should be performed to confirm infection by p. stewartiii subsp stewartii procedures for pathogenicity tests are given in appendix 5 ncppb 2295 cfbp 3167 ncppb 449 cfbp 3168 guidance on reporting and documentation is

euph05 p. stewartii ssp stewartii 2008–2009 no dna extraction is required according to tambong et al 2008 and the euphresco test performance study the following external controls should be included verification of the controls when these conditions are met false positive results have been obtained with p. stewartii subsp indologenes please note that this species has different biochemical characteristics from subsp stewartii see table 1 the pathogenicity test is carried out on 10 plants by stem inoculation of 8–14‐day‐old 1–2 leaf stage plants of a susceptible cultivar of maize e.g jubilee meritosa sweet surprise f 1 grown in a glasshouse test plants should be grown at 22–28°c under high relative humidity 70–80 with appropriate watering to avoid wilting due to water deficiency plants are needle inoculated using a sterile hypodermic syringe with a bacterial suspension 10 7 –10 8 cells/ml prepared in sterile distilled water or phosphate buffer ph 7 from isolates identified as p. stewartii subsp stewartii incubated for approximately 2 days at 25–28°c on king 's b or preferably on na poor medium negative control plants are inoculated with sterile distilled water only after inoculation plants are kept in a humid chamber for 1–2 days at 25–28°c the first disease symptoms streaking may appear after 3–5 days but 7 or more days are necessary for the more typical symptoms water soaking yellow pockets of ooze in the vascular tissues to develop wilting symptoms generally appear 14 days after inoculation in some cases yellow bacterial ooze forms in the vascular system plants should be kept for observation for 20 days re‐isolation from symptomatic tissues on media listed previously and checking of the colonies for identification should be performed – some bacteria other than p. stewartii subsp stewartii e.g pantoea agglomerans can cause water‐soaked symptoms around wounds if stem‐inoculated into maize but without ooze formation volume 46 issue 2 august 2016
