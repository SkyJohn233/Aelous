Another absolutely beautiful day!  Sometimes you just have to sit and be still. Patience is not a bad thing. pic.twitter.com/EnYzc0ViiD For some reason I’m as excited as I’ve ever been about the future. Love coaching so I imagine that’s what I will do. Smile each and every day!! Just a little break before things get going again. So many beautiful places to experience. One of my favorites. pic.twitter.com/e0Px89Qmmd Congrats to the Oregon football team on winning the PAC 12. Played great as a team. Great group of guys. What comes easy won’t last long, and what last long won’t come easy. Doak is a beautiful place, FSU a tremendous university. pic.twitter.com/O6eYfMjleD Absolutely nothing more important!  Special Lady!
