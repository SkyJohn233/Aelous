hypertext interview with eric charles may hypertext magazine shares by christine rice bedrock faith eric may s debut novel is a book you fall into fully totally and unreservedly the plot hooks you the movement is fluid the characters are razor-sharp you think about them when you re at work making dinner walking the dog those awful times when you can t pick up a book you wonder how the reformed ex-con stew pot reeves will redeem himself and how his delightfully disciplined neighbor mrs. motley will react you wonder too if the rest of the neighborhood will be as forgiving as mrs. motley where stew pot is concerned you might even doubt stew pot s fervent transformation when he tells mrs. motley …oh i read the bible every day now the lord came to me in prison he found me saved me and made me a new man you might and you d be right who wouldn t be wary of stew pot reeves after all he terrorized the neighborhood for years before being carted off to jail you re wary but you re rooting for him too you re rooting for him because he s trying to set himself straight clear the hurdles of his delinquent past he s an out-there everyman trying to reform his life eric sat down with hypertext to talk about the importance of setting one of my all-time favorite female characters mrs. motley and the importance of narrative patterns cr bedrock faith s prologue gives a detailed description of a fictional chicago neighborhood called parkland you re a native chicagoan is parkland based on any particular neighborhood why was it important to define the novel s setting for your audience em when you say black neighborhood all too often even with african-americans the first thing that leaps to peoples minds is some impoverished area with all the problems that poverty creates i didn t want my readers to have any confusion as to the sort of place that the novel is set i figured a prologue was the most efficient way to get that done like thomas hardy s english county and faulkner s mississippi county like toni morrison s ohio towns and ann petry s connecticut town parkland is a fictional locale i drew strongly from my memories of growing up in morgan park a neighborhood on chicago s far south side the section of the community where i lived has been an all-african-american enclave since the area was prairie grass in my early years there were white neighborhoods directly north east and west and open fields directly south the emotional affect was very island-like which is not to say that living there was unpleasant just the opposite in fact there were neat tree-lined streets a big park with an olympic-size pool large back yards lots of churches and with it being the height of the baby-boom plenty of other kids to play with but no gangbangers or mean cops to bother with in bedrock faith the neighborhood is a character in regards to the group perceptions and reactions of the neighborhood-at-large to what stew pot reeves and his immediate neighbors are doing this group perception serves as a greek chorus of sorts commenting not only on the behavior of stew pot et al but also giving the reader a sense of the emotional context of the place a longtime resident such as mrs. motley would of course know how her neighbors would react to things this action/reaction between characters and neighborhood is also a great story device and in the novel produces drama on several occasions cr you put a great deal of care and detail into mrs. motley s character she s fiercely proud you give the reader a detailed sense of her routine is mrs. motley based on anyone in particular or is she a composite character em she s a composite i drew heavily on the middle-class african-american women i knew growing up my mom my aunts and grandmothers teachers the mothers of kids i played with very proper church-going women who had very strong ideas about right and wrong proper personal conduct as well as an unshakable belief that getting a sound education was the only way a negro as we called ourselves back then could achieve a successful life in a predominantly white country that was often hostile to their children attaining such a life cr mrs. motley s a woman of high ideals and morals and an impeccable routine yet she never falls into cliché from her experience with her grandmother she knew how uncompromising people could get angry when refused and she did not want to run the risk of irritating stew pot even a little bit because it was now sunshine clear that stew pot was more than a little off i appreciated how you dropped the fact that mrs. motley knows stew pot is off if only to remind the audience that she s savvy and realistic em yeah she definitely has her ideals as does just about every other character in the novel they all have their bedrock faith in something it s the characters surety in their ideals that leads to a lot of the dramatic situations that arise in the story i very much wanted to make it clear to readers that mrs. motley wasn t taken in by stew pot i also wanted the scene to remind readers that he might well be nuts cr at the beginning of the book i m on edge every time stew pot appears i don t trust him i want to trust him but i don t. am i wrong to not trust him or would that be giving too much away em my thinking was since i was beginning with a prologue the story proper had to get right to what sparks the action of the story which is stew pot s arrival as far as whether you should trust him or not i d say to readers trust your instincts. cr there s a lot of history between characters in the parkland neighborhood models or patterns play an important part in developing characters what did you learn about character development during your time writing bf em a number of the characters in bedrock faith are in their senior years and have lived around each other for decades in some cases all their lives their shared history is part of what affects their actions which is just the way human nature works events of the past can be as emotionally charged for people as whatever may be happening to them in the here and now cr what did you learn about your process during the writing of bedrock faith em every scene should have causality that is some direct affect on the story this doesn t mean you have to know the story-affect a scene will have before you write it a lot of times we don t know a scene comes to us in our imagination and our storyteller s instinct recognizes it as a good scene and so we go with it that s what john schultz means by going to whatever is most strongly taking your attention for whatever reason but at some point in the writing process we have to figure out a way to have a scene directly affect what happens in the story otherwise we run the risk of having a collection of pretty scenes that don t connect to anything story-wise which can have a negative cumulative affect on the reader a good way i found to figure out causality is this the scene must cause a character/characters to do something they wouldn t have done if the scene hadn t happened or cause the character/characters to not do something they would have done if the scene hadn t happened in other words figure out a way that the scene can change character/characters action in some definite way and finally as with all writing rules the one i just gave should always be followed except of course for those times when it shouldn t you can order bedrock faith from akashic books eric will be reading from bedrock faith at sheffield s beer garden chicago il march 5 and powell s
