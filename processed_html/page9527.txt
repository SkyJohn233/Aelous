Mediaset SpA (BIT:MS) Is Trading At A 42.52% Discount   Simply Wall St News     Today I will be providing a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Mediaset SpA ( BIT:MS ) as an investment opportunity    by taking the foreast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today s value.    I will use the    Discounted Cash Flows (DCF)    model.    It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!    Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the  Simply Wall St analysis model .    If you are reading this and its not July 2018 then I highly recommend you check out the latest calculation for Mediaset by following the link below.           See our latest analysis for Mediaset             We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second  steady growth  period.      To start off with we need to estimate the next five years of cash flows.              Where possible I use analyst estimates, but when these aren t available I have extrapolated the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the year before. For this growth rate I used the average annual growth rate over the past five years, but capped at a reasonable level.            I then discount this to its value today and sum up the total to get the present value of these cash flows.     Present Value of 5-year Cash Flow (PVCF) =  €1.47b       The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business s cash flow after the first stage.      For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of the GDP. In this case I have used the 10-year government bond rate (1.8%). In the same way as with the 5-year  growth  period, we discount this to today s value at a cost of equity of 8.9%.     Terminal Value (TV)          = FCF 2022  × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g)         = €422.21m        × (1 + 1.8%)         ÷ (8.9%         – 1.8%)         = €6.06b       Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)          = TV / (1 + r) 5          = €6.06b         ÷ ( 1 + 8.9%) 5          = €3.96b              The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the cash flows,      which in this case is €5.43b.      To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding, or the equivalent number if this is a depositary receipt or ADR.                 This results in an intrinsic value of €4.79 .      Relativeto the current share price of €2.75, the stock is    quite good value        at a 42.52% discount to what it is available for right now.         Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows.    You don t have to agree with my inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them.    Because we are looking at Mediaset as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighed average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt.        In this calculation I ve used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.864. This is derived from the Bottom-Up Beta method based on comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.   Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and itshouldn’t be the only metric you look at when researching a company.What is the reason for the share price to differ from the intrinsic value?For MS,there arethreekeyaspectsyou shouldfurther research: PS.
