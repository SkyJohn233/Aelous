larger typical stilt huts and now even a smaller hotel which according to the owner s information was built only on the instigation of foreign travelers who are looking for comfort in my opinion this hotel a little disturbs the countryside but maybe i understand if come some a bit older travelers or people this hotel can be suitable for them relaxation in hammock in mai chau ecohouse in my opinion mai chau ecohouse is well located right at the beginning of the village of pom coong so you can easily walk to the small town of mai chau about 1 km over the rice fields that are really very nice in the harvest time you can also watch the everyday life and hard work of local farmers and villagers in the rice fields but they take it as a standard life they re just used to it some people might have asked if there is a hot water food wifi electricity toilets etc yes everything is here and also in the nearby villages and huts mai chau is not like a remote place in ha giang some real homestay need not have electricity but in mai chau there is really almost everything i was here in december for 5 days and the all services worked fine i would like to highlight a very tasty and good dinner in the price i think about 5 per person it can change it was a meal for almost 2 people it is also possible to buy a breakfast but i did not use them mai chau ecohouse and huts for accommodation in december i was in this place for 5 days and i have to say mainly during the night it was a quite cold it is not a place in the mountains it lies in the valley however ecohouse offers hot blankets and comfortable sleeping mats in the huts even though i was wearing a sweatshirt and trousers the temperatures fell below 10 degrees there will be another situation in the summer months it will probably be quite hot the price for 1 day and dinner was about 15 and i had the whole room in the challet for myself about 8-bed room in the cottage because it was not a seson and there were only a few tourists even in mai chau ecohouse you can see cultural performances/dances of thai ethnic groups as well as another ethnic groups such as the hmongs you can see this show probably once a week when some local thai people from nearby villages come here to show you their dance creations and you can dance with them personally such performances are also held at other nearby challets and villages view from one of the huts in mai chau ecohouse if you visit mai chau i recommend to stay here at least for a while 2-3 days mai chau is a small but a little bit more visited place mainly in the season or weekend but some villages still keeps their cultural and ethnic character i recommend to rent a motorbike or bicycle and explore this area on your own this place is on the route if you travel from
