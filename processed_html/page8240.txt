This place is an izakaya from the same people behind a bunch of other Japanese spots like Sake Bar Decibel and Rai Rai Ken, and most people will impressed that you know how to find it. The food here consists of stuff like sashimi, udon, soba, and small plates like Japanese fried chicken, and itâ€™s all surprisingly affordable. This might be why it can be tough to get a reservation here, so be sure to book in advance.
