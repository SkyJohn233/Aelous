What really matters when it comes to making a great audio ad? Through recent testing here at Pandora, we know our brains respond in different ways to ads based on key elements within specific ad creative, and we’re now gleaning more insight into an optimal complexion of an audio ad as a result.## Fizzo: The New Feel Good WaterPandora’s Insights Lab and Studio Resonate teams partnered to create a brand from scratch that would give our Data Science team freedom to test and gain insights into audio trends and some of the questions we hear the most. Enter: Fizzo Sparkling Water, the new feel good water.  Sounds good, doesn’t it?“In creating product benefits for our fake sparkling water brand, Fizzo, we picked talking points that would lend themselves well to the elements we wanted to test,” explains Miya Kanzaki, Studio Resonate’s creative lead on the Fizzo test. “Like evocative sound design (fresh from the mountains, the crack of a can opening, bubbles) and emotional appeal (proceeds donated to a charity). We utilized our existing creative best practices with the goal of making the spots as appealing and memorable as possible.” __How We Measured Success__In order to measure the differences between each A/B test, we implemented the following measurement methodologies: - __Pandora Surveys:__ Pandora Surveys is our on-platform, proprietary capability that measures ad recall and brand sentiment. Over the course of two months, we ran 7.6 million mobile audio impressions using the Fizzo creatives, and over 20,000 survey responses across all of the distinct Fizzo audience segments. No one listener heard more than one variation of a Fizzo audio ad.- __Veritonic:__ Veritonic specializes in testing audio creative to get qualitative and quantitative responses, such as feelings and emotions in real time, in addition to ad recall and purchase intent.## The Results__Brand Placement__Which makes more of an impact: mentioning the Fizzo name in the first three seconds or last three seconds of an audio spot? Turns out, mentioning a brand name within the first three seconds creates greater ad recall than the mention in the last few seconds.1  *What this means for marketers*- The first few seconds of an audio ad really matter. Use this time wisely to introduce your brand, offer, or capture a listener’s attention in a creative way. - Consider short-form audio. We’ve seen through many experiments that if you can get your message across in less time, then do so! If a listener’s attention is greatest in the first few seconds, short-form audio may be all that your brand needs.__Music Genre__Does matching a music bed with a listener’s music genre perform better?We targeted Country Genre listeners and tested a music bed that has a country, twangy music bed compared to our control spot. Which performed better? The control spot that kept its pop music brand alignment. Ad recall was 22 points below the control spot,1 and brand messaging was five points below control.2 *What this means for marketers*- Keep the music bed authentic to the brand - If you have rich audience insights to inform your decision to customize the music bed per the listener’s genre, consider adjusting the entire tone and feel of the creative for consistent alignment.__Feel Good Emotions__Do audio ads that put users in a good mood resonate more?In a recent IPG study, we found that users are 35% more receptive to ads when they’re in a good mood.3 We set out to test how effectiveness changes if an audio ad could put a listener in a positive emotional state (not just the listener being in a good mood already). Our first step was validating that the audio ad, does in fact, put listeners in a good mood compared to the control spot using Veritonic.It did! The audio ad drove higher lift in Happy and Relaxed scores. Next, we found that the ad did resonate more with listeners. The “good emotions” ad scored higher in both Ad Recall and Purchase Intent.1 *What this means for marketers*- As marketers, we have control over how we want an audience to feel when listening to an ad. The creative opportunity to put people in a certain emotion, and not just catch people in a mood, is a powerful creative tool to leverage.- For brands desiring alignment of their message with an audience’s mood, check out Pandora’s Music  &  Mindsets opportunities for information on Pandora’s Mood Score and other mindset-driven strategies.__Gender Voiceover__How does the gender of a voice make a difference in ad effectiveness?Last year, our Studio Resonate team embarked on a robust voiceover study, including over 200 voice tests, and found that both males and females preferred female voiceovers. The Fizzo test stayed consistent with these results: the female voiceover outperformed the male voiceover when it came to Ad Recall and Purchase Intent.1 *What this means for marketers*- Although we’ve seen female voiceovers perform well in our research, we’ve seen that authenticity is most important when it comes to breaking through with listeners. Choose a voiceover that is best aligned with your brand, and consider testing different ones along the way!__Brand Mentions__What is the optimal number of brand mentions?Our team created five different audio ads for this test, ranging from one brand mention to five within the 30-second audio spot. The results did not yield a significant spread in terms of overall score differences, so there isn’t one magic number to recommend from this test.1,2 The amount of times a brand is mentioned may not have as material of an impact as some other creative factors tested, although this is an area we will explore more in future testing.      *What this means for marketers*- Continue to lead your creative strategy with the overall message and story. If that requires one or two brand mentions or four or five, your audio ad is likely to resonate the most if it’s a compelling story and brand / product story.__Tone__Does an ad with more energy and an upbeat tone get better results than a slower paced one?It’s every marketer’s challenge to capture the attention of the elusive Millennial and Gen Z audiences. We wondered how energy and pacing play a role in the ability to resonate with these younger demographics. Our original (control) audio spot maintained an upbeat energy, so we tested it against an ad with a slower paced voiceover read and more mellow music. The upbeat Fizzo ad outperformed the slower version in Ad Recall and Purchase Intent among Millennial and Gen Z listeners.1 *What this means for marketers*- Similar to the “good emotions” ad, marketers have control over making listeners feel a certain way, especially when it comes to sparking energy. - Try testing tempo and tone (humor, bubbly, conversational, etc.) in your next campaign to optimize toward a tempo and tone that resonates best with your audience.## Your Brain on AudioYour brain can do a lot in a short amount of time. Have you ever stopped to think about what happens in 30 seconds? How about in two seconds?With diminishing attention spans, it’s becoming harder to reach consumers. This got us wondering: how long do brands actually have to capture attention? To better understand this, we partnered with the University of California, San Francisco to measure how long it takes for consumers to recognize that they are listening to an audio ad. We measured brand recall and recognition for two-second, four-second, and eight-second ads.The results were pretty surprising! It turns out there is significant evidence that listeners can recognize and recall ad content in as short as two seconds. This finding suggests that brands may actually have only a few seconds to capture attention before consumers actively choose to tune in or out. Knowing how important the first few seconds of an audio ad are, consider how you are introducing your brand or product. Optimize those first few seconds in order to capture attention and keep your audience engaged.## Marketer Takeaways![4533 effectiveAudioAds R1 graph](//images.ctfassets.net/nh8g790vi8yy/3nJvNSQd6OBQNGKHlpk6Iw/d97befc36d1c74cbbf19a90b4cb291d0/4533_effectiveAudioAds_R1_graph.jpg)- How are you approaching your audio creative?

Use these insights as a starting point for your creative strategy and bring in our [Studio Resonate](https://www.pandoraforbrands.com/studio-resonate) team to help guide your process. - Have you done a test-and-learn with short-form audio? We see that the first few seconds of an ad is the prime time to capture attention. How are you optimizing this time with listeners? Do you really need 30 seconds to tell your story?- Though these findings may not be the end-all-be-all when it comes to best practices, we hope they can be a starting point to help inform your audio creative decisions.

Learn More article Unleash the Power of Music to Win Today’s Teens Teens: Today’s Chief Household Influencers While marketers have been preoccupied with satisfying the needs of millennials, another demographic group with enormous spending power and influence is nipping at their heels: teenagers. For perspective, there are about 25 million teens in the United States. This group is also part of the larger Generation Z demographic—those born between 1996 and 2015.1  Who’s the boss in the household when it comes to purchasing? Well, the truth is probably not who you think it is. It’s teens. Known as the household’s chief influencers, teens’ status as digital natives gives them significant authority in household spending decisions across categories including food and beverages, household goods, electronics, and even the next family vacation.  We also know teens are an elusive demo that is hard to reach. They quickly shift brand loyalties and adopt new technologies, which often change their consumption habits. But the one constant is the passionate relationship teens have with music—it’s the soundtrack to their regularly changing lives.  That’s where we come in.  A way to a teen’s heart is through their ears Music is the #1 passion point among teens with 95% of them spending over 34.5 hours per week listening to their favorite music. Nearly two-thirds of teens say listening to music is the top activity (62%) above other activities competing for their time and attention, including Video Gaming (39%), Watching Movies (35%), and even tuning into TV (25%).2 Music is a form of both self-discovery and self-expression. Teenagers of every generation have found the appeal in the emotional impact that music has on them. In a recent Pandora Teen User Study3, we asked teens to share with us the effect of music has on them: Streaming is the #1 source for new music discovery And while youth audiences listen to music through a variety of platforms, teens are investing the most time on streaming services to listen and discover new music. In fact, two-thirds of teens say streaming services make it super easy to find new artists and music, making it their #1 source for new music discovery.2 A winning combination to reach teens:  Pandora + SoundCloud Pandora + SoundCloud together is  the  top music streaming destination among teens, helping them to discover the latest and greatest in today’s new artists and music.  Combining this with our 90% addressable audience, Pandora + SoundCloud is the best way to reach influential teens at scale. #YourAudienceIsListening and if you play it right, you can inspire lifelong customer loyalty—which is why it’s crucial to reach them  now .

Between performances on their epic comeback and Happiness Begins arena world tour, the talented trio of brothers performed an exclusive concert at Pandora LIVE. The show drew massive crowds of Jonas Brothers devotees and Sirius XM Pandora listeners. Fans started lining up around six blocks at 3 AM, having made the trek to the iconic Webster Hall in New York from places as far as London, Chile and Singapore. Attendees were eager to enjoy the once-in-a-lifetime performance from the brothers, check out emerging singer and event opener Ava Max,  and experience the multi-level interactive event featuring unique experiences and giveaways. The night of upbeat tunes and unforgettable memories was enhanced by lively activations by sponsors. Here’s how they made impressions on audience members:Fans were entertained from the first moment they arrived: __Discover__  rolled out an “orange carpet,” to welcome fans to the event, and gifted them with branded Discover glow sticks and fanny packs. While fans were waiting in line, local singer Scott Martin performed covers of popular songs, getting everyone hyped for the concert. Once fans entered the venue, they snapped pictures on the Discover branded step-and-repeat and shared their photos with their social followers.A returning sponsor, __Spectrum__ created another lasting impression on fans: a hat painting station, and black light gif photo booth. Fans selected from paint options to marble Spectrum branded hats, and then took photos with multiple props to commemorate their experience. To promote their #NatureReset promotion, __St. Ives__ gave fans a “boost of happy” with their nature-like setting and new line of mood boosting Face Mists. The misting lounge was filled with lush greenery and fruit infused water, allowing fans to relax and recharge. Fans took photos throughout the instagrammable space to share on their social media pages and sampled the Face Mists. To relaunch their timeless jingle, “What would you do for a Klondike bar?” to the Millennial generation, __Klondike__ hosted a special photo booth with fun backdrop visuals that incorporated their iconic polar bear. After their photo shoot, fans posted their pictures to their social media pages. Social influencer Denzel Dion, was on the scene to provide his 2M social followers with a behind-the-scenes look into Klondike’s activation. And the cherry on top? Free ice cream samples were distributed to all guests!__Hinge__ hooked fans up with an exclusive front row view of the show. Select fans who shared the dating app’s tagline – #designedtobedeleted – on their social pages were ushered into a premiere section near the stage to watch the Jonas Brothers up close and personal. These fans were also able to charge their phones at Hinge branded charging stations, so they could post about the event all night long! The beauty and wellness offerings were continued by __Pantene__. The brand passed out holographic makeup bags and samples of Pantene Intense Rescue Shots. Fans received cool keepsakes to use in the future and inspire their continued use of Pantene products. Much to the delight of the audience, the Jonas Brothers performed crowd favorites like “Love Bug” and “Year 3000,” as well as remixed versions of their solo projects, and new hits like “Sucker.” Fans left their night with multiple memories, souvenirs, and several songs stuck in their heads.
