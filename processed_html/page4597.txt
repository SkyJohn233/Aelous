Your Microsoft account requires attention to get insider builds. - Microsoft Community Breaking news from around the world Get the Bing + MSN extension I've been in the Windows Insider Program for months. Currently, I am on Windows Build 10240. The Windows Insider Program tells me that my Insider account needs attention. When I click on "Fix Me" it pops up the box asking if I'm sure I want to stop getting Insider builds. I do not want to stop getting insider builds. In fact, I think I should be on a later Insider build now. How do I make this go away? I tried switching to a local account and then reconnecting my Microsoft account, but it didn't fix it. Please see  Microsoft Account is required to receive new builds through Windows Update . As far as I understood: You have a Microsoft Account, and you have been enrolled in Windows Insider Program. You have your administrator account connected to the Microsoft Account (you used to register in the program). And you logged in as the administrator (connected to MSA registered in WIP), and see in Settings / Update  &  Security /  Windows Update / Advanced options the 'Your Microsoft account requires attention to get Insider builds'. Try to login to Live and see if your MSA is OK. Try to launch Insider Hub. Did this solve your problem ?             Sorry this didn ' t help.         Great !  Thanks for marking this as the answer.

Yes, I am logged in as the administrator, and I see in the Advanced update options that my Microsoft account requires attention. There is a gray "Fix Me" button. When I click on it, I get the same "Stop Insider Builds" pop-up that I would if I clicked the blue "Stop Insider Builds" link below. As for the rest, could you please be more clear on your suggestions? How do I login to Live? How do I launch Insider Hub? Did this solve your problem ?             Sorry this didn ' t help.

I mean to go to your Microsoft account settings and see that the account is OK. MSA settings are at Settings / Accounts / Your account / Manage my Microsoft account. Or go to https://account.microsoft.com . I can see my PC name in Devices section of Microsoft account settings. I have multiple administrator accounts on my PC. When I logged in with Local administrative account, "Your Microsoft account requires attention to get Insider build" is shown. When I logged in with MSA-connected administrative account, "You are ready to receive Insider builds" is shown. When I logged in as a Standard User (with local account because I have only one MSA),  there in no Get Insider builds section in Windows update Advanced options.

I went to the page you advised, and my account comes right up, and both my laptop and my desktop are listed right there under devices. I just now went to fix my update settings again, and now instead of prompting me to stop getting insider builds, it says "Sorry! Something went wrong..." and gives me error code 0x80310052. (It also doesn't seem to give me the option to stop getting insider builds anymore.) Did this solve your problem ?             Sorry this didn ' t help.         Great !

Thanks for your feedback. Just had the same issue.  Go to your MS Account webpage  LINK  and see if you have multiple versions of the same PC.  There were 4 lots of my existing PC each with different, older versions of the Insider build.  I deleted the older ones and then checked again and all fine.  Presume there is an upper limit of machine you can have registered. Did this solve your problem ?             Sorry this didn ' t help.         Great !  Thanks for marking this as the answer.
