Have Clean Bandit  &  Louisa stormed the chart already? Little Mix are STILL holding on to their top ten spot.  ' Hair '  hasn ' t dropped out of the top ten songs now for a sweet six WEEKS! Pink ' s single  ' Just Like Fire '  taken from the  ' Alice Through The Looking Glass '  official soundtrack is one hell of a track. Pink ' s trademark vocals are on point to the fullest degree. Hold up, it ' s Queen B.  ' Lemonade '  was one of the most groundbreaking albums of our time and  ' Hold Up '  is just one reason why you NEED Bey music in your life. Picture:  Beyonce.com gnash ' s breakthrough single  ' i hate u, i love u '  has come out of nowhere! If you don ' t get serious Drake vibes from this tune then you must be listening to a different track to us. Galantis are on another level when it comes to creating chart anthems.  ' No Money '  follows on from  ' Runaway U  &  I '  and  ' Peanut Butter Jelly ' . Another NEW ENTRY! Kungs is a young French DJ ready to prove he is ready for the big time! His breakthrough track  ' This Girl '  is ready to become your new favourite dance tune. Drake is just an animal when it comes to making those tracks that never leave your brain.  ' One Dance '  is a former No.1 and we don ' t expect it to be leaving the top ten any time soon. We have ANOTHER former No.1 in the top five chart-fans! Calvin Harris and Rihanna now have a collected six weeks at No.1 together with both  ' This Is What You Came For '  and  ' We Found Love ' NEW ENTRY! Clean Bandit have collaborated with X Factor winner Louisa and it is a match made in heaven! Their single  ' Tears '  is everything you need in a pop song and they ' ll be performing it at this year ' s #CapitalSTB! Wow, this is the THIRD week Justin Timberlake has reigned supreme at the top of the Vodafone Big Top 40. Congratulations JT!
