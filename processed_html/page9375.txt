Mt Cooroora  THIS steep 2km return walk takes you skywards to 439m. To do this walk, you must be prepared to climb with a chain rope through the rocky sections and multiple stairs.

Mount Tinbeerwah THIS 1km return walk is family friendly but will still keep you on your toes. The track is smoothly pathed and has a wheelchair lookout available, too. Once you ' ve reached the top, embrace the 360-degree views over lakes, the coastline and hinterland forests. Start your walk on Mt Tinbeerwah Rd, Tewantin. 6.

Kondalilla National Park WALK the 4.7km rainforest circuit to see the spectacular 90m gushing waterfall.

Noosa National Park ENCOMPASSING a rocky coastline with sheltered coves, Noosa National Park is located in the heart of Noosa, offering a strenuous 10.8km coastal track.
