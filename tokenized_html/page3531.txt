been focusing on honing webster says that hone or honing is the process of sharpening something such as a tool or skills in the stone finishing industry honing has as many different meanings as there are stone finishers honing stone the finisher may refer to it as a procedure the tile retailer may refer to it as a look or shine of the stone the term has become too diluted and over-used to provide
