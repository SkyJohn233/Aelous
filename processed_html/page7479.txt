A 62d Military Airlift Wing and 939th Military Airlift Group decals can be seen on the tail of a  McChord C-141 before aircrafts next mission. A newly                assigned C-130E of the 36th TAS fly's in formation with a 62d MAW                C-141A by Mt Rainer, WA. x In 1976 the                318 FIS painted F-106A 80776 in its special Bicentennial scheme celebrating                the United States 200th birthday. After a gradual decline of assigned units, the Aerospace                Defense Command was inactivated on October 1, 1979. All                flying units from the Command, including the 318th FIS, would be                reassigned to the USAF's  Tactical Air                Command . All aircraft                assigned to Aerospace Defense Command displayed that Commands insignia high on the                right-side of the aircraft's tail, after all air defense assets moved to the Tactical Air Command , the TAC shield was placed on both sides of the tail. A stretched   Lockheed C-141B              StarLifter with a unmodified C-141A in the background. Over it's the many years of                service, a main complaint from crews of the C-141 was that the                aircraft often ran out of space well before it met its weight                limit. In 1979 the   Military                Airlift Command began a major upgrade program for its C-141A                fleet                 by adding  fuselage                 " plugs "  in front of and behind the wing, increasing                the length of the aircraft by 23 feet 4 inches. The redesignated                C-141B's also received a  universal air refueling receptacle                above the cockpit.  On  29 May 1980, the members of                the  62d MAW ' s welcomed back  their first  " stretched "                 C-141B                (63-8082) from                the Lockheed-Georgia factory. Over the next two years 62d MAW C-141 ' s                would leave McChord on their way to Georgia to become C-141B ' s,                on 22 March                1982, the Wing would see it ' s last C-141A (65-00257) leave                for modification.                  One of the remaining F-106's from the 318th FIS leads a T-33A and a F-15A past Mt.                Rainier in Washington State. In full afterburner, the 318th FISs last F-106A , S/N 59-0141,              takes off from McChord for the final time headed for retirement in the Arizona desert  and eventual conversion to a full scaled target drone.

The 62d Military Airlift Wing was the only wing in the   Air Force assigned with the C-130 and C-141. Lt Col Chuck Colgrove, 318th FIS Director of   Operations and Lt Col John Kugler, 318th FIS Commander, celebrate   the squadrons last sortie on November 17, 1989. The Green Dragons   would officially inactivate less than three weeks later. Once                  again the roar of fighters could be heard in the sky's of                  McChord, two F-15A Eagles that once called McChord home                  returned in the colors of their new assignment - the 142d FIG                  / 123d FIS. In the first week of February 1990 Detachment 1,                  142d FIG would stand-up at the former 318th FIS alert facility                  maintaining 2 F-15's on alert 24 hrs a day 7 days a week. This                  would only last a few years, the Oregon unit would disband   their alert detachment,                  and the McChord alert facility would be reduced to a                   " cold "  status.
