At the beginning of Fetter, Walecka "Many body quantum mechanics" there is a statement, that  every property of creation and annihilation operators comes from their commutation relation  (I ' m translating from my translation back to english, so it ' s not literal). I would like to know - how. Defining annihilation operator as: a | n ⟩ = √ n | n − 1 ⟩ a\left|n\right\rangle=\sqrt n\left|n-1\right\rangle I can derive the  [ a , a † ] = 1 [a,a^\dagger]=1  equation. But in the opposite direction? I have no idea. Actually the commutation relation must be accompanied by the assumption of a vacuum state  | 0 ⟩ |0\rangle  for which  a | 0 ⟩ = 0 a|0\rangle = 0  ( ⟨ 0 | 0 ⟩ = 1 \langle 0| 0\rangle = 1 ). Then the commutation relation  a a † − a † a = 1 aa^\dagger - a^\dagger a = 1  implies also  a ( a † ) 2 − a † a a † = a † a ( a † ) 2 − a † a a † = a ( a † ) 2 − ( a † ) 2 a − a † = a † [ a , ( a † ) 2 ] = 2 a † a(a^\dagger)^2 - a^\dagger a a^\dagger = a^\dagger\\a(a^\dagger)^2 - a^\dagger a a^\dagger = a(a^\dagger)^2 - (a^\dagger)^2 a - a^\dagger = a^\dagger\\[a, (a^\dagger)^2] = 2a^\dagger and from this one, again,  a ( a † ) 3 − ( a † ) 2 a a † = 2 ( a † ) 2 a ( a † ) 3 − ( a † ) 2 a a † = a ( a † ) 2 − ( a † ) 3 a − ( a † ) 2 = 2 ( a † ) 2 [ a , ( a † ) 3 ] = 3 ( a † ) 2 a(a^\dagger)^3 - (a^\dagger)^2 a a^\dagger = 2(a^\dagger)^2\\a(a^\dagger)^3 - (a^\dagger)^2 a a^\dagger = a(a^\dagger)^2 - (a^\dagger)^3 a - (a^\dagger)^2 = 2(a^\dagger)^2\\[a, (a^\dagger)^3] = 3(a^\dagger)^2 and so on. By induction it follows that in general [ a , ( a † ) n ] = n ( a † ) n − 1 [a, (a^\dagger)^n] = n(a^\dagger)^{n-1} If we apply  [ a , ( a † ) n ] [a, (a^\dagger)^n]  to the vacuum state and assume  a | 0 ⟩ = 0 a|0\rangle = 0 , we obtain [ a , ( a † ) n ] | 0 ⟩ = a ( a † ) n | 0 ⟩ = n ( a † ) n − 1 | 0 ⟩ [a, (a^\dagger)^n]|0\rangle = a (a^\dagger)^n|0\rangle = n (a^\dagger)^{n-1}|0\rangle  which is basically what we want. Indeed, let us denote  | n ⟩ = A n ( a † ) n | 0 ⟩ |n\rangle = A_n (a^\dagger)^n|0\rangle where  A n A_n  is a (real) normalization constant such that  ⟨ n | n ⟩ = 1 \langle n| n\rangle = 1 . The above then means  a | n ⟩ = n A n A n − 1 | n − 1 ⟩ a|n\rangle = n\frac{A_n}{A_{n-1}}|n-1\rangle so all we have to do is figure out the  A n A_n -s. But  1 = ⟨ n | n ⟩ = A 2 n ⟨ 0 | a n ( a † ) n | 0 ⟩ = = A 2 n ⟨ 0 | a n − 1 [ a ( a † ) n ] | 0 ⟩ = A 2 n ⟨ 0 | a n − 1 [ ( a † ) n a + n ( a † ) n − 1 ] | 0 ⟩ = = A 2 n n ⟨ 0 | a n − 1 ( a † ) n − 1 | 0 ⟩ = ⋯ = A 2 n n ! ⟨ 0 | 0 ⟩ = A 2 n n ! 1 = \langle n| n\rangle = A_n^2 \langle 0|a^n (a^\dagger)^n |0\rangle = \\= A_n^2 \langle 0| a^{n-1} \left[a (a^\dagger)^n\right] |0\rangle = A_n^2 \langle 0| a^{n-1} \left[(a^\dagger)^n a + n (a^\dagger)^{n-1}\right] |0\rangle = \\= A_n^2 n \langle 0| a^{n-1} (a^\dagger)^{n-1} |0\rangle = \dots = A_n^2 n! \langle 0| 0\rangle = A_n^2 n!  and therefore A n = 1 √ n ! ⇒ A n A n − 1 = √ n ! √ ( n − 1 ) ! = √ n ⇒ a | n ⟩ = √ n | n − 1 ⟩ A_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}} \;\;\; \Rightarrow \;\;\; \frac{A_n}{A_{n-1}} = \frac{\sqrt{n!}}{\sqrt{(n-1)!}} =\sqrt{n} \;\;\; \Rightarrow a|n\rangle = \sqrt{n}|n-1\rangle as expected. A similar argument, which you can do as an exercise, retrieves  a † | n ⟩ = √ n + 1 | n + 1 ⟩ a^\dagger|n\rangle = \sqrt{n+1}|n+1\rangle .
