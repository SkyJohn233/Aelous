refined storage doesnt check availability of items for just enough items recipes issue 1048 raoulvdberge/refinedstorage github github is home to over 40 million developers working together to host and review code manage projects and build software together have a question about this project sign up for a free github account to open an issue and contact its maintainers and the community by clicking sign up for github you agree to our terms of service and privacy statement we ll occasionally send you account related emails already on github sign in to your account if you use the crafting grid with jei recipes the add button will be available even if the neccesary items are not available that makes you think you have all items needed after clicking he add button in the jei window the crafting grid only contains items which the system has like the standard crafting table i would expect that refined storage shows me the missing items and disables the add button intended behavior sometimes you just want to fill the crafting table as much as possible without being locked because you are missing some ingredients but showing missing items would be nice wouldnt it its a click mess if you need to move items from the window everytime to finally see that something is missing maybe add this as a feature request or do you want me to write aa new one no it 's fine this way i find this really annoying as well users should be able to choose between these two options at least has anybody found a way to do this yet this is n't just an inconvenience it 's breaking useful jei functionality the inventory reporting that an item is available when it is n't means that you ca n't see from within jei which ingredients are missing
