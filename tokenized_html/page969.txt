if you could make one new law what would it be askreddit there would be a test you would have to take before you were allowed to have children this is presidential material honestly though we have extensive procedures that must be passed before someone can adopt every time this one comes up you have never thought this one trough have you the test would most likely be ridiculously easy or to hard if it was to easy it still would root out the oblivious bad parents but other people would know what to answer and just not act like it once they have kids to hard and many people who failed the test would have kids anyway cause what is there to stop them which goes to the next problem what do you do with the kids of unlicensed parents put them in a giant orphanage foster homes leave them at the parents house exterminate orphanages would get overcrowded and you wouldn x27 t find enough foster homes because again people would have kids anyway unless you start castrating people the intentions are good but it x27 s a bad idea that will lead to more problems than solutions also don x27 t you americans if you are one like your freedom that much and how would you prevent people from having children politicians should be held accountable if they make promises that they make no attempt to keep especially promises made during their election campaign if someone is voted in because the public thought they were going to make a change that they never enact then they should face consequences for that with that said i think that all politicians should be a lot more transparent in general the public has a right to know exactly what they are voting in you don x27 t need a law idiots just have to stop voting for them put an independent on the ballot rattle this 2 party system fiasco everyone must have one drink on their lunch break to chill out not really fair for alcoholics trying to quit can it be a drink of our choice i really don x27 t like beer all that much re-take your drivers test every 5 years after turning 60 why wait i think everybody needs a refresher deliberately false accusations of anything get the accuser punished equal to what the accused would have received i x27 m not talking about mistakes like x27 this guy assaulted me x27 and then it was someone else or x27 this guy assaulted me x27 and then they can x27 t get the evidence but it x27 s not for sure that you x27 re just full of crap but x27 this guy assaulted me mwahahaha now they x27 ll ruin his life x27 i would pull a judge dredd and tell people i am the law study of politics must be compulsory for everyone starting really young in school if it is going to be a democracy the public has to know what they are voting for otherwise even the knowledgeable will suffer at their expense you have to speak dothraki at the dmv it would still be infuriating but at least it would be entertaining you know what i like that i guess i can x27 t vote anymore but that x27 s cool be excellent to each other all political establishments must now have a dedicated factchecker tm who x27 s job it is to research a topic before it is debated if the factchecker tm finds that somebody such as a congressman mp mayor etc is lying such fact is read out so that everyone knows that person is subsequently reprimanded there x27 s no specific penalty per infraction but after racking up enough it can be put to a vote as to whether that person will be allowed to continue participating 25.6m members 148k online jan 25 2008 cake day
