Description of Field Test Mode Data... - Apple Community               Looks like no oneâ€™s replied in a while.               To start the conversation again, simply ask a new question. Hello, Does anyone know where I can find the complete description of all the individual data presented in Field Test Mode on an iPhone (via dialing *3001#12345#*)? Yup, I know what the basic decible strength means, but looking to interpret all of the other details.  My goal is to find the ideal configuration for a cellular frequency booster/repeater directional antenna and am getting some odd readings so far. The fact that I am in a mountain rural area and have scarce access to two competing cellular towers miles away complicates the task. The Field Test Mode data would help refine the direction of the consitantly strongest signal. Peace, Dr. Z.

In response to Dr. Z.                               Don't know who your carrier is, but repeaters/boosters are notoriously flaky. Why not go the easy route and see if your carrier offers a femtocell.  AT & T offers one (they call it a microcell) for $150. Works great. No hassles. Just hook it up to your broadband Internet, and away you go.

I am indeed familiar with that technology, but it won't work for my needs because of a variety of reasons. The biggest detail is that I want to secure a backup Internet connection for the (unfortunately frequent) times that my primary connection goes down. I can access a Verizon 4G tower, but I have to climb ontop of a hill several yards from my home. The repeater/booster route is the way to go and works out of the box, but I just need to refine the connection a little better. Peace, Dr. Z.

In response to Dr. Z.                               This is partially why I really dislike forums.  One comes to ask a specific question hoping for specific answers only to have the discussion go in a completely different direction, the original question unanswered.  I have the same question regarding "field test mode."  Does anyone have an explanation for the data and metrics ???

It can be frustrating trying to get a valid answer out of any forum, then again, it can also be frustrating trying to solve an issue through Apple or any other big company. Other times you actually learn more from forums... Unfortunately, I have not discovered the answer to our question after several weeks. I called Apple and the person I spoke with stated that the Field Test Mode wasn't intended to be used by the general public, so they had no documentation to support it with. They had no suggestion for finding an answer to my question. I called Verizon, but of course they just told me to call Apple in a knee-jerk response. I have posted queries to this question on a few other places online, but still no response, other than very basic information like what the decibel reading means.  As for why I am seeking this information in trying to fine tune a cellular repeater antenna, well, I am forced to just slowly do it via trial and error. HA, the only problem is that the antenna is on top of my two story home and I have been climbing a ladder allot. As a retired firefighter, this is no big deal for me, but it would be nice to have the issue corrected more logically and accurately. What works one day, is less efficient the next and I can see in Field Test Mode that I am bouncing between three cellular towers. This is confusing, as I am on the edge of civilization, so only one tower should show up as the priority. Most likely I am not deciphering the data correctly, which is the whole reason for our question! More Microchips Than Sense, Dr. Z.

In response to Dr. Z.                               I have the same issue.  We live in a valley, poorly covered by Verizon, or any other cell carrier.  We have no direct line-of-sight path to any cell tower, and the nearest one is almost 5 miles away.  I'm installing a yagi antenna on our roof and am in the process of trying to align it for optimal signal amplification using a Uniden U4 booster.  Here are some things I've found out. In the Field Test app, the "Base ID" identifies the tower with which your device is communicating.  We talked to a helpful Verizon tech support person who confirmed this. Cell phone RF, like light, is best served line-of-sight.  In the absence of line-of-sight access one has to work with reflections and refractions from the surrounding topography, and trial and error is probably the best way to go.  Getting to the mount of the yagi antenna here involves climbing a ladder to the roof and then a ladder on the roof to the mounting on a bough of a large oak tree - not a huge task, but proper alignment will involve a  lot  of up and down trips.  I'm 72 years old and my wife gets very nervous when I'm working up in a tree! cellreception.com is your friend as far as locating towers.  I believe their data is crowdsourced since the major cell carriers don't make the locations of their towers available to the public.  A useful technique is to identify likely towers on cellreception.com, pin them on Google Earth, where you can actually see them, and draw a line between your location and the tower.  Go to a location along this line, closer to the tower where you can actually see it and check the Base ID.  If it matches what you see at your home location then you've identified the tower which serves you. Carriers pass off signal between towers based on a number of criteria including traffic volume, signal quality and even legal reasons related to coverage areas.  So it's logical that your Base ID will change even when standing in the same place, or be different depending on the time of day.  The tower that handles your traffic at any given time may not be the closest one. A database correlating Base IDs with tower locations would be extremely useful, but the carriers apparently keep this information very close to their chests.  The Verizon tech support person to whom we talked was willing to look up individual Base IDs for us, although the one we gave her was a 4-digit number which I would guess belonged to a Verizon Network Extender in the neighborhood; she couldn't identify it.

So you can put an antenna on your roof without written permission from all neighbors that can see it, approval from the architectural control committee, environmental impact statement, budget report, schedule with work milestones, and a final inspection from the HOA? WOW,  it must be great to live free. ðŸ˜‰                                     Aug 18, 2013 9:54 PM                                                                 Aug 19, 2013 7:35 AM in response to Ziatron                                                                 In response to Ziatron                               LOL!!  In the first place, a yagi antenna for cell phone frequencies is rather small, not more than 18 in. long or so, and encased in white plastic.  Second, our house can't be seen by any of our neighbors, and even if you're in our yard the antenna isn't really noticable since it's in a tree.  Trees interfere with cell reception, but our house is in the middle of a grove of pretty big trees, so we have to deal with that. We live in a semi-rural area in central Texas in the US without a single iota of "archetectural control" in our subdivision.  The only deed restriction on our property is that we can't raise pigs! I've been having some difficulty aligning the antenna.  We get very marginal cell signals from a lot of directions here and I have yet to find the proper direction to home in on the signal which gives us 1 bar on the phone when standing on our roof with the phone and no amplifier.  It's not as simple as "find the nearest cell tower and point the antenna toward it."  I wish I had a hand-held directional antenna which would interact directly with the phone so that I could stand on the roof and move it about to find the best signal direction in which to point the mounted yagi antenna.  Any suggestions, anyone?

Like others have mentioned, it was completely via trial and error, with numerous trips up/down a ladder. There is some equipment on the market that would have made it easier, but I didn't want to waste the money on a one-time use for the expensive tools. Regardless, here are two of those options: http://www.wilsonelectronics.com/store/display/228/79/rf-signal-detector http://www.zboost.com/yx-699.html As for another issue along this topic that has popped up, the Field Test Mode is showing odd readings after the upgrade to iOS7. The main dBm strength reading (Rx AGC0) often bounces back and forth between being much higher or lower than the numbered signal strength listed where the signal strength dots usually are. I have a screenshot of as much as a -26 dBm difference! It is almost as if the display in the upper left corner takes 30-60 seconds to catch up. Letting the phone sit still for a minute or more seems to sync the numbers to within +/- 5 dBm. Peace, Dr. Z.
