Future  &  Young Thug - No Cap : hiphopheads such a good opener, doesn &# x27;t get enough love kinda like the project itself lmao I agree that its a good opener but I think 200 might have been better as an opener. Imo it &# x27;s the best project Future &# x27;s put out since 2017. They &# x27;re not even trying too hard but the chemistry is natural. Apparently some people think this beat is generic. agreed, honestly I think my expectations were a little too high when it first dropped. it &# x27;s not top form from either artist but it still fuckin bangs " MY LITTLE BROTHER KEEP A STICK ON THE SEAT! "  gets me hype every time. great album all round imo. super under rated. HE GON BR BR BR TILL YOUR HEART STOP BEATING codeine man go stupid hard in the gym When I first listened to this I thought no cap meant no limit. Like when thereâ€™s no lid on something and it keeps overflowing. always picture them in the wild west with this song lmao South side on the track yeaaaahhhhh Fuckin love this song Such an underrated project. IMO some of Futures best work is in here. 4 da Gang is my favorite song on the album. All da Smoke is also up there. I love these trippy guitar beats like on this song and on drip too hard I say this every time a song from this project is posted here but the hate this sub gave the album is unwarranted.  Itâ€™s a good album. I agree, I &# x27;m a big fan of them both but this sub just shit on the album. I listened to it all the way through today. I love Future &# x27;s sore throat voice on Group Home. Future fucking snapped on this ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ great tape This project gets shit on in  r/youngthug , but it &# x27;s banger after banger with good production. Definitely one of my favorites 1.8m HipHopHeads 9.6k Here now Feb 1, 2010 Cake Day
