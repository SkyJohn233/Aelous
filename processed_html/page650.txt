Differences from the Beta to the finished version? : katawashoujo This post made me curious about the differences from the Beta to the finished game,can someone maybe list the major differences between the the first draft and the final script? In the Beta: Shizune &# x27;s path is completely different. It really diverges around Act 3. While on its own it is better than what &# x27;s in the game, it doesn &# x27;t match the tone of everything else, so it &# x27;s pretty clear why it got cut. Read it if you have the time, know that it is much more more depressing than what is in the final product. Emi &# x27;s art is of significantly lower quality. No real objections to what they changed there. I don &# x27;t know much though about how her route changed. Hanako &# x27;s route involves a slightly more crazy and desperate Hanako. What made it into the final product is a lot more believable, even if it is less interesting in a way. TL;DR:  Shizune &# x27;s path changed the most, I &# x27;d suggest reading it. There are minor differences everywhere else, but I don &# x27;t think they are that major. For most of the changes I heard about it &# x27;s quite graspable why they changed. Shizune &# x27;s path for example is hellishly depressing  in  the final game, once you step back and consider what you can infer about Shizune &# x27;s character from the incomplete information given. Hell if I &# x27;d need someone to make that worse. : &# x27;( I &# x27;m sorta curious too. Although I think at the same time I do  not  want to know. Ah well, difficult. :) Ya, i wanna know everything there is to know about KS but at the same time i seeing how it became what it is makes me think i will lose some of my immersion. So, I had to - curiosity got the better of me - read up about the Shizune beta story. I agree with kevinturnermovie that it really didn &# x27;t fit the tone of the game. And now, that I got the intelligent part of this post out of the way: ><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">What the...< strong> ... I can &# x27;t even cry about this, my brain is not done processing the mix of feelings of just how horrible that is versus how it wasn &# x27;t the actual final version and for good reason was not sued. And my favourite character in the game... and ... and then that &# x27;s the good ending. And then in the bad ending... and ... Fuck it! If that had been in the final game, considering I had Shizune &# x27;s bad ending the first time I played, I would have stopped. I mean it. I found it difficult enough to go on as is, after lots of crying over the bad ending. But that beta script... wow. *breathes* Ofc, I realize it only appears this horrible to me because I contextualize it against the current game, trying to change the story of the current characters, as presented in the game, and as evolving with in the game, to the beta &# x27;s plot. >So in other words, I reckon if I had played that in the final game it would probably have had <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">less< strong> emotional impact on me. But still, since my brain can &# x27;t help interpret it with the characters I know from the release... wow. Fuck! But, disregarding the emotional stuff, I think the final Shizune version is better. Adding emotions, the other one would simply not have fit, horrible as it was. I can see why they changed it, it wouldn &# x27;t have worked. It was definitely built to be an emotional pit of a script, but it wasn &# x27;t... relateable. No one knows anyone who had this happen to them. Katawa Shoujo &# x27;s strength is how easily the girls, their demons and hisao &# x27;s weaknesses reflect in us or the people we know. >Shizune&#x27;s beta script didn&#x27;t work like that. It was a tragedy in 4 acts, one worse than the other, but it was just that... a tragedy. To quote Emi, these things happen. It would have made me sad to read, but I doubt it would have shaken me with emotions like her final script does.< p> View entire discussion (8 comments) More posts from the  katawashoujo  community 481 Posted by u/the_high_flying_ace 1 day ago SPOILERS Classic Joke         .t3_ebhh38 ._2FCtq-QzlfuN-SwVMUZMM3 {          --postTitle-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;          --postTitleLink-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;        }       481 30 comments share save hide report 475 Posted by u/Robert_House2077 4 days ago Santa Hana - Daily Hanako #239         .t3_e9yuto ._2FCtq-QzlfuN-SwVMUZMM3 {          --postTitle-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;          --postTitleLink-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;        }       475 4 comments share save hide report 470 Posted by u/AnotherMMD 5 days ago MEME *Sigh*         .t3_e9nfh5 ._2FCtq-QzlfuN-SwVMUZMM3 {          --postTitle-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;          --postTitleLink-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;        }       470 3 comments share save hide report 416 Posted by u/JohnPatrickDLate 3 days ago SPOILERS Would you like to join?         .t3_eafwrh ._2FCtq-QzlfuN-SwVMUZMM3 {          --postTitle-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;          --postTitleLink-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;        }       416 17 comments share save hide report 416 Posted by u/AnotherMMD 6 days ago MEME Stonks Stonks Stonks         .t3_e95hby ._2FCtq-QzlfuN-SwVMUZMM3 {          --postTitle-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;          --postTitleLink-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;        }       see full image 416 14 comments share save hide report 354 Posted by u/blandsabbath 3 days ago emi at her emiest, just got this done!         .t3_ear2su ._2FCtq-QzlfuN-SwVMUZMM3 {          --postTitle-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;          --postTitleLink-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;        }       354 14 comments share save hide report 319 Posted by u/demo_koi 5 days ago Daily Rin #97 - she confounded         .t3_e9goos ._2FCtq-QzlfuN-SwVMUZMM3 {          --postTitle-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;          --postTitleLink-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;        }       i.imgur.com/7zW9oU... 319 12 comments share save hide report 314 Posted by u/Overinterpretation 3 days ago A happy little accident         .t3_eaj1pd ._2FCtq-QzlfuN-SwVMUZMM3 {          --postTitle-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;          --postTitleLink-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;        }       314 13 comments share save hide report 314 Posted by u/Player4_mista 4 days ago Distraction - Daily Kenji #99         .t3_ea25wn ._2FCtq-QzlfuN-SwVMUZMM3 {          --postTitle-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;          --postTitleLink-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;        }       see full image 314 10 comments share save hide report 302 Posted by u/nabmeonr890 18 hours ago she paint [sudou noboru]         .t3_ebrlg6 ._2FCtq-QzlfuN-SwVMUZMM3 {          --postTitle-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;          --postTitleLink-VisitedLinkColor: #979798;        }       302 9 comments share save hide report Continue browsing  in  r/katawashoujo r/katawashoujo 22.9k Members 69 Online Jan 4, 2012 Cake Day
