remained crowded. it was a place where we used to relax and spend time together my friends and i swam in it regularly said the 80-year-old edited by hasan meer there was a time when the capital 's azimpur area was vibrant with four ponds among the four three of them are still surviving while the other one was not that fortunate among the surviving three the condition of one is deplorable also access to the other two has become limited for protection and cultivating fish in one of those many of the elderly residents still get nostalgic while talking about the time they spent swimming in those or relaxing by the banks three of the water bodies belonged to the public works department pwd while the other one was privately owned while many of the capital 's water bodies have fallen victim to encroachment or pollution the pond beside the azimpur colony masjid majar remains an example of how those can be restored and kept alive once the around 1.3-acre reservoir used to be a perfect place for the people of the neighbourhood to spend their leisure time it was there since the pakistan period but over the years it lost its natural look and the water became polluted the water body also became a breeding ground for mosquitoes the pwd restored the reservoir last year the tk 2.6 crore renovation work was done under the direction of the prime minister and an additional secretary of the finance ministry said tushar alam sub-assistant engineer of the pwd boundaries were constructed around it for protection there is also a ghat landing spot with benches where people can sit and enjoy the serene atmosphere foyez uddin a resident of the area said the fisheries department used to release fish fries in it before the renovation work also a good number of people used to swim and bathe in it now swimming and bathing have become limited in order to keep it free of pollution said tushar alam the pond at azimpur dayera sharif khankah is as old as the place itself hazrat shah sufi syed mohammad dayem one of the prominent sufi saints founded the shrine of dayera sharif in the 18th century it has been said that the pond is there since then shah sufi saiyad ahmadullah mutawalli custodian of the dayera and an inheritor of hajrat dayem told the daily star that the pond used to be around two bighas around 18 kathas of it has already been sold by another owner who got it as a successor he said at present the reservoir might be over one bigha though it is still there we may not be able to keep it intact due to a continuous demand for accommodating our large group of family members. once we used to cultivate fish in it we stopped doing that as we did n't make any profit he said anwar hossain a local said everyone had access to the reservoir and they used to bathe in it it was filled up partially around 20 years back. rowshan ullah a successor of the owner said the pond is in death throes its water has become polluted as people from the nearby residences continue to throw waste in it he alleged we want to keep it alive but we 're not sure if we can due to a lack of funding he said there used to be two ponds near agrani school and college inside the azimpur colony one of them is in a comparatively better condition while the other has been filled up to make way for buildings parvin begum who looks after the around 1-acre pond said people still bathe or swim in it however a restriction is imposed for a few months when the fisheries department releases fish fries for cultivation she said she has been taking care of the water body since her husband who used to work for the pwd passed away we release fries such as ruhi katol silver cup tilapia and chital in it. also there used to be another pond on the south side of the school
