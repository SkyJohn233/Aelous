it s too much just thinking montrosepress.com copyright © var today new date var year today.getfullyear document.write year 2019 • wick communications terms of use privacy policy bruce grigsby the english romantic poet william wordsworth begins one of his sonnets the world is too much with us late and soon getting and spending we lay waste our powers little we see in nature that is ours we have given our hearts away a sordid boon he laments that we have become much too materialistic to notice or value things that really matter the apostle paul in his first letter to timothy writes but those who desire to be rich fall into temptation into a snare into many senseless and hurtful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction for the love of money is the root of all evils it is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced their hearts with many pangs. i have had the opportunity to meet and converse with a few people who have attained the kind of wealth that enables them to charter private jets rather than go through airport security and more than a few who are wealthy by any standard my experience with most has been positive sharing some time with those who appreciate that their hard work and success enable them to provide security and opportunity for family and in many cases employment for others with a genuine sense of satisfaction this winter i met an agreeable young fellow probably late 20s or early 30s on his way to some skiing in telluride he loved skiing and was excited about the opportunity he spent however about half of the time between montrose and telluride on his phone discussing business with colleagues and a client still single and focused on building his portfolio i asked how long he would be in telluride he said four days two of which he would be working and hopefully two days skiing it was his first vacation in two years i m confident he could buy and sell me many times over but i had to wonder about the price he s paying to be in that position i m an old guy with a comfortable pension a paid-for home and some time to hunt double bogies they re not difficult to find and grateful to the hard-working taxpaying citizens of colorado who have contributed to the aforementioned retirement income maybe it s a luxury that allows me a little too much time to ponder about the state of things and our collective future i probably thought the world was about to end when gasoline first reached 2 per gallon a perspective to bear in mind as i worry that we may have become a culture in decline but i fear we are increasingly finding it difficult to handle the wealth and power we ve acquired individually and as a nation jonah goldberg was a guest last week on morning joe promoting his new book suicide of the west. of course the program is on msnbc and subject to dismissal as just another part of the leftist fake news media that is hell-bent on destroying what little might be left of our once-proud and great democracy that may be but i found his commentary interesting and worthy of reflection first goldberg rejected the notion that our death as a culture is inevitable by noting that he purposely chose the term suicide because it is a choice rather than an inevitability a choice with the possibility of being avoided a primary concern of his is our incredible increase in material wealth without an accompanying appreciation for either the benefits of modern affluence or the contrasting challenges of living in earlier times in other words we are generally feeling entitled to ever-increasing levels of money and comfort with little appreciation for a broader understanding of how they have been achieved and the potential negatives that tend to accompany the acquisition of wealth and power it s not unlike hamlet s complaint about his widowed mother s attraction to his new stepfather why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on. the more we have the less satisfied we become mostly cultural but with implications for public education goldberg says we fail to teach gratitude for all we have promoting instead a tribalism that defends what we have against all threats real or perceived to take it away if president trump is at the center of the current political polarization goldberg suggests he is more a symptom than a source

monday i heard another interview recently in which it was suggested evangelicals who support trump regardless of lifestyle concerns seemingly in contradiction with their spiritual values sought trump not as a husband but rather as a bodyguard who would protect their interests by whatever means necessary that would seem to support the symptom idea lord acton s famous dictum power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely is another factor to consider goldberg commenting on his book went on to say that on the path toward possible suicide our wealth and resulting power is accompanied by corruption he defined corruption as giving in to primal instincts rather than the adherence to social norms established to curb those instincts which make it difficult to co-exist in a civil society the tribalism becoming so ingrained in our political life is one of those instincts according to goldberg which prompts us to only inflict pain and failure on those we see as threats an instinct we need to override if we are to decide against suicide speaking of lord acton and his theory of corruption i ran across an interesting statement of his the notion of sin and repentance waned with the belief in authority men thought they could make good the evil they did. maybe maybe not but i fear the world is becoming too much with us or more probably for us to handle bruce grigsby has a
