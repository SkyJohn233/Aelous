didn t meet quotas were killed families of laborers were held as collateral to ensure workers performed up to expectations and hands were chopped off as proof that under-performers were executed at the time leopold established the congo free state africa s population was estimated to have been between 90 and 130 million under his control some 10 to 22 million people were murdered european countries finally forced leopold to cede the congo free state to the government of belgium in 1908 but leopold would never answer for his crimes he died as the wealthiest man in europe and spent his
