Noctilucent Clouds As you can see from the image, NLC’s are seen best just after sunset.  They glow an electric, blue-white.  They are normally seen from locations near the  poles  of the Earth, but in recent years, they have been seen at much lower-latitude locations (like Colorado or Virginia in the U.S.).  It’s this change in the locations of NLC’s that makes scientist think they may be a sign of global  climate change  on Earth, specifically  global warming  which is influenced by  human activity .  Scientists will look into this possibility with a new atmospheric mission,  AIM  (The Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere). These eerie looking clouds have only been  studied in the recent past .   Now, people are becoming more aware of NLC's. You too can  be an observer of these clouds  and can even  share that information  with others on the Internet!
