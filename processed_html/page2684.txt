Duff Green. The  Pilot  was a campaign paper for William Henry Harrison and John Tyler, the Whig candidates in the 1840 presidential election. It was four pages in length and contained matters related to the Whig party of Maryland, election news, editorials, letters to the editor, as well as public sales, shipping and commercial intelligence, marriage and death announcements, poetry and fiction, and advertisements. A  weekly  edition and a semiweekly called  Pilot for the Country  were also published by Green. Green first became involved in politics in Missouri, where he was elected to the state legislature. President James Monroe appointed him a brigadier general in the Missouri state militia in 1820. In December 1823, Green purchased his first newspaper, the  St. Louis Enquirer , and molded it into a political newspaper that supported John C. Calhoun, and subsequently Andrew Jackson, for the presidency in 1824. Green then moved to Washington and bought the  United States Telegraph  and likewise used it to champion Jackson's politics. When Jackson won the presidency in 1828, Green became a trusted adviser in Jackson's "Kitchen Cabinet's" and was appointed the official printer of Congress. In 1831, Green broke with Jackson and became a Whig supporter. He retired from the  Telegraph  in 1836, but continued to edit campaign newspapers, such as the  Pilot . In the months leading up to the 1840 election, Green was embroiled in a religious controversy that played out in the pages of the  Pilot  and eventually led to the paper's demise. It began when Green responded to a letter republished in the September 5, 1840, issue of the  Baltimore Sun  written by Bishop John England of Charleston, South Carolina, in which the bishop stated that it was the duty of good Catholics to support the Van Buren administration in the election. Green responded with an editorial on September 7 that urged Protestants to unite not only to resist Mr. Van Buren, but to resist Catholicism. The Maryland Whigs were uncomfortable with Green's statements and insisted he leave religion out of the  Pilot  political discussions. Green ignored their demand, and the Maryland Whigs withdrew their endorsement of the  Pilot  in a statement published on October 26 that repudiated Green's comments regarding Catholics and naturalized voters. Afterwards, the number of subscribers to the  Pilot  dwindled, and the paper suspended publication in early 1841. Green remained active in politics, acting as an advocate for free trade in England and then as the American consul to Texas in the 1840s. He was staunchly pro-Southern and opposed to abolition. But although Green supported states rights, he opposed secession. In 1860, Green was President James Buchanan's unofficial agent to President-Elect Abraham Lincoln, urging Lincoln to come to Washington and help Buchanan reach a compromise with seceding states. Green died on June 10, 1875, at his estate in Dalton, Georgia.
