reliable climate micro or otherwise anywhere in france for some time it has been very topsy-turvy and unpredictable like all of western europe drought in region x one year stair rods the next this year the centre and lower normandy inland of the coast have had consistently good weather meaning sunny but not overly hot compared to most places further north west east or south but 2007 was crap and god knows what 2009 might bring in an average year if you want somewhere with a fair dose of sun and not too hot taking that to mean below 28° in july anywhere from brittany through the centre and north east to alsace should suit but is there any such thing as average these days the weather is all over the place i reckon it ll be pot luck for sun and temperature wherever you go unless you go to the vaucluse or similar where it ll probably be sunny but too hot how far do you want to drive 4 hours from calais 6 hours from st malo the french always say that the ta ta.queueforload

is almost guaranteed to be hot and sunny 2007 was cold and although this year was better it was not up to the norm for july anywhere between poitiers and tours is easily accessible by car from the channel ports requiring about 4 to 5 hours driving from caen or about 6 from calais if you want to be on the coast the ile de ré is worth looking at it has its own micro climate which usually means good weather but with the weather nothing is guaranteed you will need to add about 2 hours driving to the above figures the only problem with the ile de ré is that the whole of france seem to like it

generally hot so the pool was needed but as said previously it has become more of a lottery recently the gite was the grange les mortiers on http //www.frenchholiday.co.uk/ and type in les mortiers
