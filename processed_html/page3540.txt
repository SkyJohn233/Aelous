NextGen Leaders 2017 Nominations - Kansas City Business Journal Are you preparing yourself to take the lead? The  Kansas City Business Journal  is looking for those businesspeople - entrepreneurs, executives, professionals - who will lead their companies, and their community, into the future. Our NextGen Leaders program is designed to recognize the budding talent in this community, but that ' s just the start. The program ' s objectives include helping emerging leaders continue to build their knowledge and skill sets, and to connect them with each other and the present generation of Kansas City leaders. The  Business Journal  seeks nominations of people who are making a difference and who are destined to leave their mark on the business community. A panel of judges will select 25 NextGen Leaders based on their accomplishments, talents and drive. The aim is to add another talented class each year and build a framework in which emerging leaders can learn, share and build a network of fellow NextGen Leaders. Entry is a two-step process! The program kicks off with the online nomination process, which will remain open until April 21. Only one nomination per person is necessary; additional nominations carry no weight, and all nominees will be invited to apply. The  nominee will then be asked to submit an application, which a panel of judges will review. After the judges make their selections, the fifth class of NextGen Leaders will be announced. The NextGen Leaders will be featured in a supplement to the  Business Journal  and recognized at a private luncheon in their honor.
