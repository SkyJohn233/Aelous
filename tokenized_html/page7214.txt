labor standards for the warehouse part 4 what are predetermined time systems logistics viewpoints editor s note this is part 4 of a series on warehouse labor standards click here to read parts 1-3 time studies and predetermined time systems are the two most accurate ways to develop labor standards time studies are easy to understand these stopwatch standards involve consultants timing how long it takes workers to perform different types of tasks actually we ve gone beyond stopwatches today automated software programs on small terminals make it much easier to collect time study data predetermined times systems are more difficult to explain charlie zosel a vice president at tza walked me through some of the different pre-determined time system methodologies pre-determined standards are based on tables that document how long it takes for a person to make very elemental motions these elemental motions have times associated with them which are aggregated to define an activity in warehousing master standard data msd and the maynard operations sequence technique most are the two most common methodologies used msd is more common than most in production environments where many tasks are very repetitive methods time measurement mtm is frequently used imagine for example putting a standard together for grabbing a pencil while sitting at a desk mtm would break this task into reach 18 inches grab and return time segments msd is somewhat less granular it would have obtain as the elemental motion and just one time measurement associated with obtaining the pencil most is even less granular obtaining a pencil would be part of a larger process sequence msd tmu table for obtain click to enlarge let s move to a more relevant example building mixed-case pallets you can decompose this activity with msd into the following elemental motions each with a time associated with it travel to the pick location on a pallet jack walk from the pallet jack to the slot bend to pick up the case grab the case walk back to the pallet jack bend and place the item on the pallet jack clearly elemental motions have very small time units associated with them these are called time measurement units tmus which equal 1/100,000 of an hour in the above mixed-case pallet example most would not break the process down so granularly most would have one time associated with traveling to the slot all the other elemental tasks would have just one time measurement associated with them even when predetermined systems are the predominant methodology for setting labor standards they are almost always supplemented with a time and motion study in order to understand how fast forklifts or other equipment move if you examine the msd table above it is pretty easy to see that unless you ve been trained you would have a hard time using these tables young industrial engineers ies will not provide exactly the same measurements for a process as more experienced ies so there is an element albeit a small one of subjectivity consultants who specialize in predetermined time systems will tell you that the days of spending 12 months building very granular standards from elemental motions for an entire warehouse are over their customers want faster more economical results over time consultants have built up elemental motions into patterns that are consistent for almost all dcs for example a typical work pattern might be obtain large dense case from the middle tier of a three tier pallet rack. this is 60 tmus if you purchase redprairie s labor management system lms for example it comes with a database that has thousands of these patterns and associated tmus further if a pattern does not fit the norm experienced industrial engineers don t need to break the activity into all of its components they just swap out the nonstandard elemental units so which is better pre-determined time systems or time and motion studies not surprisingly the answer is it depends they each have their pros and cons which now that i think about it would be a good theme for a future posting your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name email website notify me of follow-up comments by email notify me of new posts by email
