Helicopter Drops Thousands of Easter Eggs PANAMA CITY -   Hundreds of children, parents, and grandparents waited anxiously outside the Bear Creek Assembly of God Church at this hunt to catch eggs from the sky. Church organizers rented a plane from Panhandle Plane to throw 5,000 Easter eggs onto the ground. It's the first year the church put together an Easter egg drop. They say the amount of local support overwhelmed them. "It really made me feel good to see the church, my home people come out and work hard to support this and then to see the community respond. It means a big deal. We want to be part of our community. We want our community to be a part of us," said Tony Teas, Pastor for Bear Creek Assembly of God.  Organizers say they plan to have another Easter egg drop next year after seeing how popular the event was Saturday.
