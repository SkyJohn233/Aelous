Topical Hydroxyurea and Psoriasis - ScienceDirect ScienceDirect Hydroxyurea, as a 10% cream, produces a significant involutionary effect on psoriatic plaques when used under continuous plastic film occlusion. When used with only partial occlusion, however, the effect is only slightly better than that of the base alone. Further studies with the use of metabolically active derivatives of hydroxyurea and/or different vehicles are warranted.
