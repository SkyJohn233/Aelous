name-calling other negative remarks about this forum its moderators and administrators or your fellow members even if this is just your own personal opinion respect your fellow members dear members our membership like our country consists of people from all walks of life different in far more ways than can be listed here and each with a different view based on their experience of life regardless of their colour religion or cultural heritage every single person in the uk has been born of mixed race – we are a multi-coloured and multi-cultural country as many of you are aware there are a handful of individuals amongst this membership that persist in making provocative inflammatory racist and otherwise offensive comments this has been happening across the forum to a certain degree but is most especially prevalent in the adult section the moderation team has tried to stay on top of this however unfortunately because of the offensive nature of much of its content we don t monitor the adult section quite as much as perhaps we should as a result much of this behaviour has gone unnoticed unless it has been reported to us while the team always intended to take a light touch approach to the adult section it would seem that some people aren t quite adult enough to be left unmonitored after all this behaviour is and always has been against forum rules as well as the specific stipulations of the adults forum and it will no longer be tolerated we feel it 's time to draw a line in the sand and as such from this point onward offenders will receive an immediate and permanent ban from the forum in order for us to achieve our goal of restoring the forum to the friendly and tolerant place it once was we ask that all members be mindful of the content they post and help us to stop unacceptable behaviour by using the 'report tool at the bottom of any offending post the results of which can be seen only by admin/moderators you should all receive a copy of this message by pm
