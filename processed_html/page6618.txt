PressReader - The Freeman: 2018-02-10 - Only NFA rice is in short &# xAD;age De­spite short­age of Na­tional Food Author­ity (NFA) rice, there is no short­age in the sup­ply of rice in the coun­try. The NFA clar­i­fied yes­ter­day that the coun­try still has suf­fi­cient sup­ply of com­mer­cial rice. "In gen­eral, wala tay rice short­age kay ang nagkuwang NFA rice ra man. Daghan pa man hi­noon og com­mer­cial rice," said Olma Bayno, in­for­ma­tion of­fi­cer of NFA-7. NFA-7 also be­lied re­ports it is but fak­ing the is­sue of NFA rice short­age. "Wala gyud inta­won mi na­makak. Tin­uod gyud na nga gamay na lang ang stock sa NFA rice," Bayno said yes­ter­day, even urg­ing skep­tics to visit the agency's eight ware­houses in Re­gion 7. Re­cent in­ven­tory places only 107,000 bags in the eight ware­houses, which are good for only three days. Be­cause of the short­age of NFA rice, prices of com­mer­cial rice have in­creased from P1 to P3 per kilo. Bayno said there is no NFA rice im­por­ta­tion, so far, but 325,000 met­ric tons of com­mer­cial rice im­ported by the pri­vate sec­tor will ar­rive in the coun­try soon. "Pero ang im­por­ta­syon sa NFA rice wa pa gyud mi kahibalo kung kanus-a," Bayno said. Com­mer­cial rice is more ex­pen­sive than NFA rice. The NFA rice is priced at P27 per kilo (25 per­cent bro­ken) and P32 per kilo (15 per­cent to 20 per­cent bro­ken). Due to scarcity of NFA rice, NFA-7 has stopped its rice al­lo­ca­tion to 1,018 ac­cred­ited NFA re­tail­ers in Cebu since Fe­bru­ary 2, 2017. Bayno said the re­main­ing sacks of NFA rice have been re­served for emer­gen­cies or dis­as­ters. By or­der of pri­or­ity, the De­part­ment of So­cial Welfare and Devel­op­ment (DSWD) gets the sup­ply for emer­gen­cies such as dis­as­ters. In fact, Bayno said, they have stopped al­lo­cat­ing rice to DSWD-7 since re­lief packs are in­tended for vic­tims of Mayon Vol­cano in Al­bay. CPDRC With the sit­u­a­tion, the Cebu Pro­vin­cial Gen­eral Ser­vices Of­fice (PGSO) rec­om­mended for the pro­vin­cial gov­ern­ment to pur­chase rice for the Cebu Pro­vin­cial De­ten­tion and Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Cen­ter (CPDRC) from other sup­pli­ers. NFA has de­cided to stop sup­ply­ing rice to CPDRC be­cause of the short­age. CPDRC nor­mally re­quest 1,000 sacks per month. "Wala pa hi­noon mi nakadawat sa ilang re­quest for NFA rice al­lo­ca­tion but even if mo re­quest pa sila, dili pa gyud mi maka­hatag kay gamay na lang gyud ang NFA rice sa Re­gion 7," Bayno said. Gen­eral ser­vices of­fi­cer Jone Sepe said the prov­ince is not limited to NFA rice. “Sa mga sit­u­a­tion nga dili ka-pro­vide ang NFA, wala sab gi-limit nga dili ta maka­palit sa uban nga sup­pli­ers,” Sepe said. The CPDRC has al­ready pro­cessed its pur­chase re­quest for com­mer­cial rice. Its cur­rent sup­ply can last only up to Mon­day, Fe­bru­ary 12. Sepe said the prov­ince can ask for ex­cep­tion from Repub­lic Act 9184, the law that re­quires pub­lic bid­ding as a pre­ferred mode of award be­cause the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion is emer­gency in na­ture. “Pwede man ta moin­voke kay kani, to save life man ni… dis­as­ter sit­u­a­tion man ni nga di kakaon… ki­na­hanglan pakan-on man gyud so mo-skip ta sa pros­eso,” Sepe said. NOT CITY PROB­LEM At the Cebu City Hall, Mayor To­mas Os­meña said he will let the na­tional gov­ern­ment deal with the rice short­age prob­lem at the Cebu City Jail. “That's a na­tional gov­ern­ment's prob­lem. Not ours. Why should we come to the res­cue? Let them solve that prob­lem,” he told re­porters. Last Thurs­day, Cebu City Jail War­den Renante Ru­bio ad­mit­ted that the jail fa­cil­ity is among the in­sti­tu­tions af­fected in the rice sup­ply of Na­tional Food Author­ity-7. Ru­bio said there are 4,925 in­mates in­side the fa­cil­ity that will con­sume at least 30 sacks of rice per day or over 1,080 sacks of rice ev­ery month. Os­meña said he pities the pris­on­ers but his­tory pre­vents him from giv­ing aid to the city jail. “You know why we stopped giv­ing as­sis­tance to the city jail? Be­cause they pocket the money. When I asked them be­fore, can we au­dit or we'll do the cook­ing for you? They didn't like so I cut it off,” he said. “So now, that's their re­spon­si­bil­ity. We'll give them rice, they'll keep half of it. There's so much cor­rup­tion there,” he added. There is short­age in the sup­plyof NFA rice, but sup­ply in com­mer­cial rice re­mains steady,clar­i­fies the Na­tional Food Author­ity - 7 yes­ter­day. © PressReader. All rights reserved.
