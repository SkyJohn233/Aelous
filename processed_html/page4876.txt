Author Ronald Destra-  http://www.ronalddestra.com/  A small tadpole born alongside hundreds of others wanted nothing more than to stand out, to  50 BOOKS FOR 2 YEAR OLDS  How many of these have you read? This is a great list! Holly Mommaerts says August 16, 2014 at 9:22 pm Your #2 is actually written by Stella Blackstone  &  illustrated by Clare Beaton. I was searching our libraries online catalog  &  no search results were found for  laire Beaton  But when I did a search for Stella Blackstone farther down your list  How Big Is Pig  was listed there. Allison McDonald says August 17, 2014 at 12:30 am This has me puzzled because I own this book and there is NO mention of Stella Blackstone at all except in the very small print. She is indeed the author though, how odd that her name would be omitted! Robin Guyette says October 2, 2014 at 5:57 pm My kids always loved If You Give A Mouse A Cookie and the others like that. I loved those books. Also, The Rainbow Fish. Too many to list. Now I have 2 14 month old twin granddaughters to start all over again. Love reading to them. Carrie says January 18, 2015 at 2:42 pm Thanks so much for putting this together!  My daughter goes through books soooo many books and it really helps to have the guidance of a list of good books that are age appropriate rather than just looking through the shelves.  I ve already ordered a bunch of these that weren t in our local library through our interlibrary loan system.  Your work is appreciated. Tessa says January 29, 2015 at 4:53 pm I have a 1 year old and a 2 year old. We Love many of those book and among our favorites Llama Llama Red Pajama JamBerry The Little Blue Truck books and King Jack and the Dragon. The best part is they are pretty fun to read.
