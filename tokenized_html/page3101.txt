build a cordova app with angularjs damien antipa github twitter jan 5 th 2014 comments initially i used to develop my ios applications natively in objective c. however since i am not doing that on a daily basis i kind of lost track of newer features and got tired searching through the api to make my way luckily i am working with web technology on a daily basis and even more luckily there is apache cordova former phonegap for quite a while around to bootstrap my new application i quickly started to look around what framework would be best to use my choice was angularjs for no particular reason other then that i wanted to try how it will work on cordova i will give you a step by step guidance how to set up the environment and bootstrap a new application for cordova i will do that with angularjs and yeoman though all of this steps can easily done for ember backbone etc just use the appropriate yeoman generator to use a different framework the node package manager will help us to install cordova globally through the shell as well as yeoman on mac osx and unix you have to execute this with root permissions yeoman will also install grunt and bower for you now you are ready to create a new cordova project simply navigate to your workspace folder and execute this will create your new cordova app under /kitchensink you should see a structure like that for your development you will mainly focus what goes under www and platforms let s start adding target platforms i would like to have my kitchensinkapp on ios and android addtionally i would like to add the compass plugin to my project eventually the project is ready to be combined with the web application we create a new folder in the project and let yeoman bootstrap an angularjs app for us follow the dialog to create a new angular project structure and have a look at the angular generator it provides you plenty of useful commands to add views controllers services etc i recommend you not to directly create an angular project in the /www folder even though it would work having all depending node modules in there will cause a massive application size and takes lots of compiling time to build the angular project use the grunt configuration given by yeoman this will generate a build output in your webapp folder under /dist in order to integrate the files into your cordova project you will either need to copy the contents of this folder to /www you may do that manually change the grunt script or build a shell script i leave that up to you now navigate back to your cordova app and execute the build command to create or update the project that s it all your different builds are available under /platforms copyright 2014 damien antipa powered by octopress
