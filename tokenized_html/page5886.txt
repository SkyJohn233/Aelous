ciara 's a hermaphrodite ciara 's pregnant ciara 's going out with bow wow the artist formerlyknown as lil bow wow which we 're presuming entitles us to call him bigwow wow next time we see him scream the gossip columns across the web.designer magazine 's alex mccann side-stepped the gossip and talked to ciaraabout being an army brat getting crunked up and how 's she 's rapping onmissy elliotts new record q you spend your formative years of your life travellingfrom city to city and country to country as what you describe as an armybrat a up until the age of 8 i was travelling and it was14 when i decided to do music i 'm definitely an independent person andit opened up my mind so much as to the type of person i am it made wewant to try different things it makes me want to explore more and it informsme who i am as a person q living over in europe in germany did it make itmore important for you as an artist to make your name over here as wellas in the states a you know what i think it 's important period evenif i did n't live there it would still be important to me you know it'svery meaningful to have fans all over the world it 's means so much tome yer know i think it 's important regardless of whether i lived thereor not q were you surprised at the success of goodies a you know what i definitely believed in the recordwhen we were writing it but i did n't know it would go to number 1 as fastas it did in america i definitely was caught of guard with it being number1 in the uk that was just amazing to me even though i believed it wasa hit record q goodies was the second ever crunk n b song forthose people that have n't signed up for the crunk revolution would youlike to explain what it is a when i define crunk music i define it as the heavymetal of hip hop it 's high energy music and i think what makes a crunkrecord a genuine crunk record is like for example if lil jon produces it.lil jon is the king of crunk and he 's know for making that crunk musicand that crunk beat and that crunk sound so when you add r b to ityou make this high energy crunk n b q so you 're the queen of crunk n b then a no i do n't like being called the queen of crunk n b nor the princess or the lady of crunk n b i 've only got one crunk n'bsong on my album but i guess people want to give me that the title forsome reason i 'm definitely not the queen of crunk q as you said earlier you 've only been in the businesssince you were 14 it must have been a mad journey a it 's been crazy i 've had my bad experiences and goodones all of them have made me a much stronger and wiser person it 's mademe who i am today and there 's so much more that i have to learn but it'sdefinitely been a journey for me at the end of the day i 've enjoyed itand look what 's happening to me now it 's been a great journey it 's ablessing q before you went solo you were actually in a girlgroup what happened there a i went to audition for the group and there was actuallya girl who went for the same spot who 'd been in a profession big recordinggroup before it was a funny thing because i got the position over herand i 'd never had vocal training i was just singing off natural talent.we were together for a little bit and we started to have differences ijust decided that going solo was what i wanted to do and what would bebest for me at first i was interested in doing the group situation butthen eventually i realized that being solo was what i really wanted todo it 's just easier when it 's one q at the time you started singing you were rappingas well a well i used to rap around and play around outsidein the neighbourhood with my friends but i never went and recorded raprecords or anything like that i used to do a bit of freestyling whichwas fun it was crazy missy made me rap on this song it 's crazy becausei 'm so shy when it comes to that but she got me to do it if you 've gotmissy digging what you do it must be good she 's incredible i ca n't evenremember the freaking songtitle at the moment but it 's gon na be her firstsingle back and it 's about how music makes you lose control q some of the people you 've worked with on the album- r kelly ludacris etc a missy lil jon jazzy it 's been crazy it 's beena blessing yer know all the people are so talented and they 've been aroundfor so long and to know that they believe in me as an artist and to knowthat they were interested in working with me means so much to me q when you sit down on a day off and look back youmust think 19 and i 've done all this a i definitely think about how blessed i am i appreciateeverything that has happened to me and that is happening to me especiallyat this age i do realize that a lot of people do n't even get half as muchas what i 've had happen to me almost for their whole lives i pray fora long career and strive for longevity q and i guess that 's why you 've co-wrote most of thesongs on the album do you think it 's important for an artist to writetheir own songs a for me i like to be involved in my record just becausei want my music to reflect who i am as a person as much as possible ithink it 's very important that i give people the real me and because ilove writing writing is something i 've been blessed with i 've been blessedwith this talent to write it 's great to have that talent under your belt but i do n't think that everybody has to be a writer though q would you consider writing for other artists a for sure i 've actually done it before there wasa song that i wrote when i was 15 that mya loved so she used it for heralbum and i also had a song on the proud family soundtrack it was onthe america idol featuring alicia key 's but alicia keys was n't on therecord i 've also done a song for fantasia 's album called keep me waiting a song i wrote with jermaine dupri q you sing you write you dance you rap is thereanything you ca n't do a oh my goodness there are some things i ca n't do but i 'm working on the things you would n't expect i 'm working on a clothesline at the moment but i do n't wan na tell you much cos someone will thengo and get that idea it 's gon na be hot though and at that point as if someone was looking downon us the fire alarm sounds in the hotel and we 're ushered out on to thestreets of london ciara the girl who 's so damn hot she set alarm bellsoff ************* 1 2 step featuring missy elliot is
