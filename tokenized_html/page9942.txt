overview of its elements at the end of the overview you may choose whether to continue to see the overview on each launch or not next you will see a quick start guide with the option to disable this feature from displaying on each launch navigation between sections in a tab is generally done by swiping the screen the major views of inner balance are controlled through the tabs at the bottom of the screen then you will see the login button for heartcloud setting up an account will enable you to syncronize session data across all your devices earn trophies and receive helpful tips on training if you choose to skip this step at this time you can set up and login at any time from within settings login and sync to access help at any time tap the help icon in the upper right of your screen or tap and hold the screen tap the icons to access the help features please attach the sensor now to the charger port of your ios device and clip the ear pulse sensor to the center of your earlobe now tap once to activate the menu bar with the start and stop button tap start to begin your session if mood selection is on â€“ it comes up first please see settings on the next page to turn this feature off there are several different screens that are active during a training session you may select between them their layout will differ somewhat between iphone and ipad see settings to toggle on or off the session views the top of the screen initially shows your pulse then switches to your heart rate variability hrv pattern hrv will show a smooth rhythm when you are in the state of coherence* or inner balance the small dot below the hrv rhythm indicates your coherence level red for low blue for medium and green for high the colored display in the center of the screen helps you pace your breath to increase your coherence the red blue and green squares on the border of the circle are added every 5 seconds and show you how much time you have spent in low medium or high coherence coherence is the degree of order harmony and stability occurring in your autonomic nervous system and higher brain centers a more coherent hrv pattern reflects efficient or optimal function which is related to the ease and flow of energy and information flow in your nervous system and between your heart and brain an erratic incoherent hrv pattern reflects stress and energy drain the hrv or heart rhythm pattern informs the brain how the heart and body feels and affects brain centers involved in decision-making and your ability to maintain composure especially in challenging or stressful times coherence is not just relaxation it is the synchronization of the activity in the parasympathetic and sympathetic branches of the nervous system it reflects a calm yet energetically present and aware state the practice of heart coherence with the inner balance app facilitates mental functions it opens more access to your higher intelligence and improves focus creativity intuition and decision-making after being in heart coherence we perform better we feel more confident positive calm yet energized access the settings by tapping the icon in the upper left of the screen click this icon in the middle of bottom of your screen to access social media and share comments on facebook twitter or email using the settings icon you can select which session metrics you wish to share by toggling on or off you will need to be logged on to third party applications such as facebook or twitter and in some cases allow specific access to share these are the screens you can swipe through while running a session the first two screens help pace your breathing show your coherence level and have a coach prompt you on what to do next my inspiration session screens show you an image or video to inspire you to higher coherence the image and video can be customized with your personal image or a video from your camera roll using settings also in the settings you can turn off the video soundtrack or disable the display of any view if you do not want to use it detail session screens plot the coherence over time pulse heart rate hrv rhythm and the power spectrum you will also find unless disabled in settings a small breath pacer in the form of a moving ball at the top of the screen the two views above display a number of metrics for your training the score board includes coherence length session and achievement coherence in the purple section is your current coherence score this is a measure of the degree of coherence in the heart rhythm pattern a coherent heart rhythm is a stable regular repeating rhythm resembling a sine wave at a single frequency between 0.04- 0.24 hz 3-15 cycles per minute the scoring algorithm continuously monitors the most current 64 seconds of heart rhythm data and updates the score every 5 seconds the more stable and regular the heart rhythm frequency is the higher the coherence score scores range from 0-16 typical scores range between 3.0 -6.5 but values as low as 0.0 and higher than 10.0 are not uncommon with practice and regular use you will begin to notice your normal coherence score level and how it fluctuates when you have more or less focus and when you experience greater levels of inner balance use your score range as your guide to setting the challenge level and achievement goal the pink section is the length of your session the orange section shows your achievement this is the sum of your individual coherence scores during the length of a session it can be improved by achieving higher coherence scores and the length of time spent in coherence during the session it is the total of all coherence the scoring algorithm updates your coherence score every 5 seconds during an active session and adds them together giving you a sum which is called achievement on the app displays you may want to set a daily achievement goal for yourself an achievement score of 300 points per day is a good place to start this could be accumulated in a single session or split across two or more sessions depending on your schedule or preferences on the detail screens you also see these graphs right below the score board hrv is heart rate variability this is the normally occurring beat-to-beat changes in heart rate analysis of hrv is an important tool used to assess heart-brain interactions and autonomic nervous system dynamics function synchronization and balance hrv is considered a key indicator of aging cardiac health resilience and overall well-being coherence over time cot cot charts your coherence scores over the entire length of the session the chart is updated every 5 seconds with each new score the background of the chart reflects the coherence level thresholds for the current challenge level setting red low blue medium green high when you achieve higher levels of coherence scores the plot window will auto scale and the red and blue portions will get smaller pulse graph pulse data is collected from the sensor and shown on the pulse graph your current heart rate is displayed right below this chart in beats per minute spectrum graph displays a mathematical transformation of the heart rhythm data into its frequency components the slowest low frequencies are shown on the left hand side of the graph and faster high frequencies on the right as the heart rhythm becomes more coherent the frequency distribution becomes more concentrated into a signal peak the spectrum is updated every 5 seconds to stop your session tap once to activate the menu bar with the start and stop button tap stop to end your session when the session is stopped you will see this summary view below it is similar to the detail of the history views below select the review tab to access your session history progress awards and goals tap the history icon to see the list of sessions select a session from the list to see the session report to delete a session tap and slide to the left on the session you wish to delete the coherence score displayed in the history view is an average of the coherence score throughout the entire session it will differ from the last coherence score displayed in the session view on the review tab tap goals to see our initial set of personal goals tap awards to see any awards that you achieve tap progress to see achievement average coherence score and challenge level goals the mood selection visibility is controlled in settings by default you can choose the emoticon that matches your mood you can have it prompt you when you start a session stop a session or enter a new journal entry if you did not select an emotion it will display as a gray icon on the journal tab you can add edit or delete journal entries to document your journey and moods use the +icon

accumulated in a single session or split across two or more sessions depending on your schedule or preferences heart coherence coherence refers to your internal order or harmony increased coherence enables better balance greater health and new levels of creativity resilience and productivity coherence indicator the small colored circle near the top of the session view reflective of your state of coherence over the last 60 seconds it indicates your current state of coherence green for high blue for medium and red for low coherence score a measure of the degree of coherence in the heart rhythm pattern a coherent heart rhythm is a stable regular repeating rhythm resembling a sine wave at a single frequency between 0.04-0.24 hz 3-15 cycles per minute the scoring algorithm continuously monitors the most current 64 seconds of heart rhythm data and updates the score every 5 seconds the more stable and regular the heart rhythm frequency is the higher the coherence score scores range from 0-16 with practice and regular use you will begin to notice your normal coherence score level and how it fluctuates when you have more or less focus and when you experience greater levels of inner balance use your score range as your guide to setting the challenge level and achievement goal challenge level these settings are thresholds for the levels of coherence that determine if you are in low red medium blue or high green coherence there are four different challenge levels 1 2 3 and 4 as your coherence score rises you shift from one range low med or high to the next the coherence score threshold between the three ranges is gradually increased at a rate of 15 for each higher challenge level 1 3 and 30 between 3 4 the following table and figure shows the threshold setting for each challenge level coherence and achievement scores are not affected by the challenge level setting coherence over time is a graphical display that charts your coherence scores over the entire length of the session the chart is updated every 5 seconds with each new score the background of the chart reflects the coherence level thresholds for the current challenge level setting red low blue medium green high when you achieve higher levels of coherence scores the plot window will auto scale and the red and blue portions will get smaller coherence ratios a session summary of the amount of time as a percentage of the total session length in each of the three challenge level ranges for example in the session below the coherence ratio display shows 2 low 5 medium and 93 high this score will be affected by your challenge level settings heart rate variability hrv the normally occurring beat-to-beat changes in heart rate analysis of hrv is an important tool used to assess heart-brain interactions and autonomic nervous system dynamics function synchronization and balance hrv is considered a key indicator of aging cardiac health resilience and overall well-being power spectrum a
