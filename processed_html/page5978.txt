Heating from the “inside out”, a horizontally mounted rear jet burner blasts intense hot air through inner vent tubing under the oil, then exits safely through a rear exterior vertical exhaust. Heat transfers through the metal tubing into the oil. The fryer V-Bottom collects loose batter below the heat source to prevent scorching. Cooking oil stays cleaner and lasts much longer. Stainless construction and bottom Drain Valve provide easy clean-up. Make your backyard a Wild Life refuge for food, fun, and fellowship with a Bayou Classic® 2.5-gallon Fryer.
