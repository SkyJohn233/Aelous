The Jam: Fire And Skill: The Jam Live | Louder By Mark Beaumont September 04, 2015 Live punk and new wave tapes are beginning to have the cultural currency of Goons recordings, Beatles studio banter and British footballing successes, in that they re unrepeatable. With Paul Weller on a creative high and relations between the members about as warm as between Syrian factions, it s unlikely we ll ever see The Jam play live again, and we ll certainly never experience the firebrand thrill of watching them rip through  The Modern World ,  In The City  and classic soul covers at the 100 Club or the Music Machine (now Koko) while sweat pours from the ceiling and Bruce Foxton tells the front row scrotes to stop spitting. All of which makes the six-disc box-set  Fire And Skill: The Jam Live , tracing their rise and implosion through one show in each of their six years on Polydor, a stethoscope on the speeding heartbeat of new wave history. Besides the savage post-punk lust that Weller and co. plough into  Down In The Tube Station At Midnight , revenge-on-society rampage  Billy Hunt  and youth culture anthems of socio-political ire like  In The Street Today  and  Time For Truth , the early sets bristle with snarling between-song witticisms that garrotte you with a skinny tie and drop you right in the room.  Earlier on I was kicked out of the ladies  toilets by Tom Robinson,  Weller riffs at Reading University while Foxton, suffering a major technical issue at the Music Machine, bewails,  Why does something always go wrong at these big shows?  Priceless. The venues grew alongside the catalogue. By  81 they were plastering  A Town Called Malice  and  That s Entertainment  with northern soul brass and amphetamine tempos at the Hammersmith Palais, and come  82 they were well out of spitting range at Wembley Arena, starting sets with  Start! . By now their soul revue slant had come to maturity with  Beat Surrender  and their shows were a slick mixture of polished punk sneer, Who mod strut and Supremes pop swing. Yet the likes of  Down In The Tube Station At Midnight  and  Going Underground  still had the sketchy filth of the 100 Club under their fingernails, despite their extended clap-along segments. You could take the boys out of the grotty punk dive Acid: Reissues _ _ _ _ Most Popular By  Louder November 30, 2019 By  Classic Rock November 30, 2019 By  Louder November 30, 2019 By  Louder November 30, 2019 By  Scott Munro November 30, 2019 By  Louder November 30, 2019 By  Scott Munro November 29, 2019 By  Louder November 29, 2019 By  Louder November 29, 2019 By  Louder November 29, 2019 By  Alice Pattillo November 29, 2019 By  Louder November 29, 2019 By  Scott Munro November 29, 2019 Sign up below to get the latest from Classic Rock, plus exclusive special offers, direct to your inbox!
