The first librarian was Ruth VanderMolen. The second librarian was Robert Dickson.  History  The Scottville Public Library has its roots from 1899 when a retired local banker, Charles Blain, donated a lot for the library on South Main Street in Scottville. Money to construct a building for use on that lot was raised by hosting public fund-raising events and by starting a subscription service. The first building which stood in the lot was the Blain Reading Association, named after Charles Blain.[1]  The library existed in this location until 1940 when it was sold and a new building was constructed. The library shared this new building with another company, and at the time was situated on the second floor.[1]  References     "History of the Libraries of Mason County" (PDF).

Steinbeck based the novella on his own experiences working alongside migrant farm workers as a teenager in the 1910s (before the arrival of the Okies that he would describe in The Grapes of Wrath). The title is taken from Robert Burns' poem "To a Mouse", which reads: "The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft agley". (The best laid schemes of mice and men / Often go awry.)  While it is a book taught in many schools,[3] Of Mice and Men has been a frequent target of censors for vulgarity, and what some consider offensive and racist language; consequently, it appears on the American Library Association's list of the Most Challenged Books of 21st Century.[4]  Plot  Two migrant field workers in California on the                 Revolvy Brain (revolvybrain) Revolvy Brain (revolvybrain) Revolvy Brain (revolvybrain) Benjamin Joseph Allen (born January 5, 1947) is an American academic who served as president of the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) from 2006 to 2013.

The locking is completed by circular muscles just inside the female's vagina; this is called "the knot" tightening thus preventing the male from withdrawing. The circular muscles also contract intermittently, which has the effect of stimulating ejaculation of sperm, followed by prostatic fluid, as well as maintaining the swelling of the penis and therefore the tie, for some time. For domestic dogs the tie may last up to half an hour or more, though usually less.[7]  The bulbus glandis also occurs in the penises of some pinnipeds, including South American fur seals.[8]  See also   Canine reproduction  Mating plug   Notes     Howard E.

Thomaso is now best known as the foundation upon which Aphra Behn constructed her finest play, The Rover, or the Banished Cavaliers (1677).  Autobiography  Though Killigrew drew upon Mateo Alemán's picaresque novel Guzmán de Alfarache for source material, his Thomaso is generally considered strongly autobiographical; it is no accident that the title is the Spanish version of the playwright's given name. Like his earlier comedy The Parson's Wedding (but unlike the tragicomedies that make of most of his dramatic output), Thomaso features abundant bawdy humour and sexual frankness, to the discomfiture of generations of traditional critics.
