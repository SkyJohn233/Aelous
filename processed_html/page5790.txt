Jquery- disabling  ' on change '  event handler before it runs - Stack Overflow                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 http://jsfiddle.net/B9Fub/ So here I have fields that are filled when the first input is 'changed' But I don't want it to run [change] if they input in the first field and click the 'find' button. I was wondering if there was a way to do this. From what I found, 'change' happens before the 'find' button if you click on it. I've tried changing 'change' to 'focus' and give it to the other field so the first field has no event handlers, but that may give me trouble further down the way. I need the fields to be filled but I don't want them filled if the user clicks the find button. The  mousedown  event fires before the  change  event, so by using that and jQuery's  data()  method you can set a flag to see if the  activeElement  is in fact  #test  when the find button is clicked, and if so don't set the value : FIDDLE Still, not sure what you want. Maybe this will help. I've found the answer. Using e.stopPropagation(); on $('#find') allowed me to stop the .change() from occurring                                  Click here to upload your image                                 (max 2 MiB) Cancel and add another image You can also provide a  link from the web .
