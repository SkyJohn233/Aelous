Structure of New Deodorant Biphenyl Compounds from Thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) and Their Activity Against Methyl Mercaptan: Agricultural and Biological Chemistry: Vol 53, No 5 The leaves of thyme ( Thymus vulgaris  L.) were found to contain new compounds, 4′-hydroxy-5,5′-diisopropyl-2,2′-dimethyIbiphenyl-3,4-dione (1), 5,5′-diisopropyl-2,2′-dimethylbiphenyl-3,4,3′,4 / -tetraone (2), and 4,4′-dihydroxy-5,5′-disopropyl-2,2′-dimethylbiphenyl-3,6-dione (3a). These structures were determined by chemical and spectroscopic methods. The deodorant activity of compound 1 against methyl mercaptan was more effective than that of rosmanol, carnosol and sodium copper chlorophylline.
