It ' s a Cracker! | News Four Facebook Messenger WhatsApp Twitter Copy Link AddThis Time is running out for all you food historians. It s your final chance to visit the exhibition entitled  Jacob’s Biscuit Factory  &  Dublin: An Assorted History  on Pearse Street. Drawing on the vast 330 boxes of Jacob Biscuit Factory Archives held at Dublin City Library, and using beautifully illustrated panels, oral histories, flags and original artefacts, the exhibition tells both a chronological and thematic history of Jacob’s Biscuit Factory. The events of 1913-1922 which impacted on Ireland nationally feature prominently and using the lens of the factory allows the exhibition to provide a unique contribution to the Decade of Commemorations.  The exhibition also tells more broadly the impact of Jacob’s on social, cultural and political life in Ireland throughout the twentieth century.  It includes an impressive time-line showing the changing faces of Jacob’s biscuit labels throughout the decades, and original artefacts such as a locked recipe books, an ‘Irish Free State’ Biscuit tin, employee welfare booklets,  and a truncheon used during the 1913 Lock-out alongside with a  letter from Trade Union leader Jim Larkin.  Visitors will find out about the fascinating history of the Jacobs cream-cracker, who was the marketing genius to develop the concept of Jim Figgerty, and how did major national and international events from 1916 Rising to both World Wars impact the business, customers, and staff.  The exhibition will be on display at Dublin City Library and Archive, 138-144 Pearse Street until 28 October. Opening hours are Monday   Thursday 10am-8pm  &  Friday-Saturday 10am-5pm. Free guided tours are also available every Tuesday morning. Booking is required  here .
