Our walks are free, sociable and open to all. Our walks usually take in the lovely surroundings of Insch, finishing off with a hot drink and a slice of toast at the leisure centre. We sometimes travel to access walks in other areas too, for those who fancy venturing a little further afield! Can you help us improve this listing?
