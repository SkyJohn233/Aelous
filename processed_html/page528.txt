She was hanging around our house for days seeming hungry, thirsty and lost so we took her in and had her checked out by a vet. She doesn't have a chip, is worm-free and aids free, looks like a 6-month old kitten but is actually between 5-6 years old and is 100% Bengal. She has a sweet, gentle, cuddly, playful temperament. (We already have two cats or we'd keep her.) Please message me if you know anything about her or would like to adopt her!
