characters nets you nifty rewards here and there training mode story quest objectives- you get 1 gem for every objective you fulfil it x27 s slow but it adds up there are currently 270 quest objectives that x27 s almost enough for one 6-pull training mode has its own set of objectives too buy them- can get expensive fast but if you want gems right now without any work that x27 s what you have to do you x27 ll also get materials which you can use to craft your own exs if i x27 m missing anything please reply to this and say what it is say nice things ahhh i should not have acted like a

sub would love the content and we want to take this opportunity to reflect discuss and appreciate all the fun we had with pokemon duel this year hi all i x27 ve never been active here but i played podu from international release and mourned it x27 s loss this past halloween like most of you i x27 ve searched for similar games and hoped for a showdown-style version of duel unfortunately there aren x27 t any games too similar and while i support the efforts it x27 s clear that a version similar to the mobile app is quite a ways away so i x27 ll cut to the chase i x27 ve picked up a ton of different games and hobbies and i think other like-minded people i.e podu fans would enjoy them too i x27 ve put games into 3 categories as they relate to pokemon duel reminiscent similar and unlike here x27 s my list reminiscent of pokemon duel final fantasy tactics an undeniable classic like duel it x27 s a turn based board game with lots of strategy and synergy involved classes have rock/paper/scissor dynamics the story is genuinely good too an updated version original was released in the 90s is on the ios/google store for 10-15 depending on where you live tactics ogre let us cling together same company as final fantasy tactics in terms of difficulty and general feel if final fantasy is skyrim this is dark souls i say that because tactics ogre only provides you with a handful of tools at a time and presents a lot of unfair challenges early on e.g you have to beat a mage on top of a giant hill when you have mostly melee classes that being said i really enjoy these challenges you can x27 t go wrong with either game polytopia really polished build an empire game i originally wanted to stay away from the genre but the gameplay is too good it x27 s turn-based on a board with a talent tree so lots of strategy involved my only issue is that in order to play pvp you have to set up a hame on discord since there isn x27 t a matchmaking feature however playing against the computer is worthwhile similar to duel to certain ways harvest town i x27 ve only played a bit of this but it x27 s clear that i could sink 300+ hours into it very detailed and lots of different ways to play brawl stars supercell annoys me but the game is pretty solid lot x27 s of different modes and genuine strategy is required pokemon masters well this probably invalidates this whole post it x27 s really not a great game but it x27 s got pokemon and a turn-based battling system so it could be worse the devs seem to actually listen to the community so that x27 s a plus nothing like duel but great nonetheless pocket tanks you x27 ve probably played this at some point in your life and i got ta say it x27 s aged well the base game is free and the entire set of weapon packs is pretty cheap if you x27 re completely bored right now and wanted to pick up a fun easy to intuit game give this a try cod mobile nothing like duel but definitely gives the rush of beating someone in pvp the way duel did however be warned that like duel you x27 ll play mostly bots early on yoyo i had to throw this on the list since it x27 s what i x27 ve spent most of my time doing since duel left i realized that any mobile game i can get into can be taken away at any point so why not pick up a hobby i can keep forever this may be a stretch but i also don x27 t think playing yoyo is completely unlike duel it x27 s complex there x27 s lots of strategy and there are synergies between tricks e.g some tricks can naturally lead into others yoyoing might be a great outlet for people like r3iko and tarvold and others who enjoyed making decks around niche strategies if the complexity of duel is what kept you interested consider finding your old duncan butterfly and give it a try that x27 s all i got folks thanks for reading and good luck to all the devs working hard on a reboot 13.5k members 13 online jan 24 2017 cake day
