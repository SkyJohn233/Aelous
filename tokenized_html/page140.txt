possession of methamphetamine possession of methamphetamine otherwise known as meth crystal speed or ice has harsh consequences in both state and federal law while possession of a small amount of meth can lead to simple possession charges possession of a larger amount can lead to a charge of possession with intent to distribute which can mean even stiffer penalties in some states a person arrested for possession of precursor chemicals/ingredients or meth paraphernalia but no meth may still be charged for possession of methamphetamines precursor chemicals are any over-the-counter drugs or chemicals used in the production of meth among others this includes ephedrine methylamine phenyl-2-propanone hydriodic acid and hydrogen gas meth paraphernalia includes implements used to smoke sniff or shoot the drug as well as instruments used to make weigh or package the drug in 2005 the federal government passed the methamphetamine epidemic act as part of the government s war on drugs the act heightened penalties for meth possession as well as placing stiff restrictions on legal uses of meth states have also recognized the growing epidemic of meth use and as a result some have followed the federal government in implementing heightened penalties for meth possession convictions defenses to possession of methamphetamine charges include challenging the intent of the individual charged the sufficiency of the evidence and/or the police testimony as well as the the constitutionality of the stop search or interrogation another defense to possession of methamphetamine is that it was legally prescribed by a healthcare provider to be convicted of possession of meth the individual must have intended to possess the drugs this necessary element protects innocent bystanders who may unknowingly be living with a meth user or have had the drug planted on them for example the simple presence of meth in a home does not necessarily implicate every individual that resides in the home to prove the possession charges the prosecutor will have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the individual charged had the intent to possess the meth found in the home the person charged with possession can defend against the charge by showing that he did not intend to possess the meth found in the home challenging the constitutionality of the meth possession charge can be used in cases where the police perform a warrantless search without having probable cause in these situations it may be possible to get the evidence of the search suppressed in court likewise if the police arrest an individual for meth possession after making an illegal traffic stop that is they pull the individual over for an insufficient reason this also may be a defense to the possession charges penalties for methamphetamine possession will vary depending on whether the arresting agency is state or federal the amount of the drug in possession and the individual 's prior criminal record possession of a large amount of methamphetamine can raise a simple possession charge to a possession with intent to distribute charge which can dramatically increase penalties possession of methamphetamines is generally charged as a felony but laws regarding penalties for meth possession can vary widely amongst states some states offer sentence-alternatives to prison such as drug courts and drug-treatment centers while others do not penalties will also depend on how many prior drug-related offenses the individual has as well as the individual 's overall criminal record however methamphetamine possession is generally always treated as a felony which can amount to prison time hefty fines and/or felony probation federal law requires a minimum prison sentence of 5 years for possession of any amount over 5 grams and a maximum sentence of 40 years if convicted of possession of 50 grams or over the mandatory minimum sentence is 10 years and the maximum is life fines can range anywhere from tens of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars because meth is believed to be an extremely dangerous drug there will generally always be a jail sentence as a result of a federal possession conviction no matter how small the amount of the drug is actually possessed penalties will increase in both state and federal courts if the individual charged with meth possession is arrested around children or a school zone including the school property or a school bus a person arrested for meth possession around children may also get charged with child abuse if the individual is arrested for possession of meth in a school zone it is generally not a defense if the person did not know he was in a school zone penalties may also be increased in some states for possession near public housing or a public park moreover because the production of methamphetamine is toxic even simple possession may implicate some states environmental laws as well which can heighten penalties freeadvice® has been providing millions of
