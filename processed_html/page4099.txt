Scorpio women - suspicious and arrogant               by Anonymous                         I met my ex Scorpio through friends. She looked innocent, full of life, and had a devil may care attitude. I found that attractive. We got married soon after. She challenged every bit of my existence. Disaster. Once married, her real self showed. I have not, in my entire life, met someone so conceited and arrogant - by their own admission, their friend's admission, and my observation. I have not met someone so vindictive, scheming, and calculating. I have not met someone so narcissistic. I have not met someone with such bottomless low self-esteem. I have not met someone so suspicious. Thinking back, I do not believe she lived one moment with me genuinely. Thinking back, now that my head is clear from her influence, she conducted her life in threads of unfathomable convolutions. She fed on dark matter.
