Watch for certain appliances with electric motors that "surge" wattage demand during startup.  Devices such as computers can be damaged by generators without surge-balancing ability.  Check with a certified electrician or professional generator installer for any installation that ties into your home wiring or if you have concerns about specific applications.  Generators can NOT be run indoors.  Copyright 2004-2014 PartsTree.com.  PartsTree All Rights Reserved. PartsTree.com and  Hill Country Outdoor Power  are HCOP, LLC companies. 512-288-4355
