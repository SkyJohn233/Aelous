Tycoon’s flats plan for St John's Wood Barracks 'will ruin memory of military past' | London Evening Standard Evening Standard Home The latest headlines in  your inbox Register with your social account  or  click here  to log in A tycoon's £1.5 billion plans to demolish a historic barracks to make way for luxury housing have been approved — despite fears they will cause “considerable harm” to the area. Ananda Krishnan’s Usaha Tegas Group bought St John’s Wood Barracks, which were home to the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery, for £250 million in 2012 after a fierce bidding war.  The billionaire businessman is set to bulldoze all but a Grade II-listed riding centre on the 5.4-acre site, including the 1920s neo-Georgian Officer’s Mess, to make way for 163 new homes. The scheme has been given the green light despite a warning from English Heritage that the plans would mean “losing an important reminder of the area’s military past”.  A spokesman said: “The plans to demolish the Officer’s Mess will cause considerable harm to the character and appearance of the area.”  St John’s Wood has had a military presence for almost 200 years, with the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery stationed at the barracks since 1947 before moving to Woolwich in 2012. The plans approved by Westminster council include 147 flats, six seven-bedroom houses and a private health club. St John’s Wood Square Ltd, which will manage the project, has agreed to 59 of the flats being affordable and to build a further 41 off-site, as well as giving the council £2 million towards education and health facilities.  A Westminster council spokesman said: “English Heritage and Westminster council don’t always agree on everything. One reason being the council is in the position of having to balance the need for more housing, growth and jobs against the backdrop of some of the world’s most important heritage.” New: Daily podcast from the Evening Standard Subscribe to The Leader on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Acast or your chosen podcast provider.
