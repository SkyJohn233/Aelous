This study is to document thechronological profile of ST-1.METHODS: We perform serial analysis of 17 Taiwanese patients with ST-1 focusingon evolution of clinical features, electrophysiological findings, geneticstudies, and neuroimage examinations.RESULTS: All patients had a mutation at 554A-- > G in exon 3 of the NEU1 genecausing Ser182Gly substitution. Fifteen patients were homozygous. Two patientswere heterozygous with novel mutations, 956C-- > T causing Ala319Val in one and163C-- > T causing Gln55stop codon in the other. The neuraminidase activity wasmarkedly decreased in all 11 available patients. Only three patients (17.6%)manifested the macular cherry-red spot. The majority of patients (82.3%)developed full-blown manifestation of myoclonus, ataxia, and seizures within 5years. Abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials with giant cortical waves werefound in all patients. Prolonged P100 peak latency of the visual evokedpotentials (VEPs) were found in 16 patients (94.1%) in the early stage evenwithout visual symptoms.CONCLUSION: ST-1 in Taiwanese population illustrates distinct characteristics of phenotype with infrequent cherry-red spot. We suggest to screen the NEU1mutations in patients presenting action myoclonus with abnormal VEPs, evenwithout macular cherry-red spots. ><
