the governors awards annually for lifetime achievement in film the academy plans to open the academy museum of motion pictures in los angeles in 2019 the notion of the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences began with louis b. mayer head of metro-goldwyn-mayer he said he wanted to create an organization that would mediate labor disputes without unions and improve the industry x27 s image he met with actor conrad nagel director fred niblo the head of the association of motion picture producers fred beetson to discuss these matters the idea of this elite club having an annual banquet was discussed but no mention of awards at that time they established that membership into the organization would only be open to people involved in one of the five branches of the industry actors writers and producers after their brief meeting mayer gathered up a group of thirty-six people involved in the film industry and invited them to a formal banquet at the ambassador hotel in los angeles on january 11 1927 that evening mayer presented to those guests what he called the international academy of motion picture arts and sciences everyone in the room that evening became a founder of the academy between that evening and when the official articles of incorporation for the organization were filed on may 4 1927 the x22 international x22 was dropped from the name becoming the x22 academy of motion picture arts and sciences x22 several organizational meetings were held prior to the first official meeting held on may 6 1927 their first organizational meeting was held on may 11 at that meeting douglas fairbanks sr was elected as the first president of the academy while fred niblo was the first vice-president their first roster composed of 230 members was printed that night the academy bestowed its first honorary membership to thomas edison the academy was broken down into five main groups or branches although this number of branches has grown over the years the original five were producers directors and technicians the initial concerns of the group had to do with labor x22 however as time went on the organization moved x22 further away from involvement in labor-management arbitrations and negotiations x22 one of several committees formed in those initial days was for x22 awards of merit x22 but it was not until may 1928 that the committee began to have serious discussions about the structure of the awards and the presentation ceremony by july 1928 the board of directors had approved a list of 12 awards to be presented during july the voting system for the awards was established the nomination and selection process began this x22 award of merit for distinctive achievement x22 is the initial location of the organization was 6912 hollywood boulevard in november 1927 the academy moved to the roosevelt hotel at 7010 hollywood boulevard the month the academy x27 s library began compiling a complete collection of books and periodicals dealing with the industry from around the world in may 1928 the academy authorized the construction of a state of the art screening room to be located in the club lounge of the hotel the screening room was not completed until april 1929 with the publication of report on incandescent illumination in 1928 the academy began a long history of publishing books to assist its members another early initiative concerned training army signal corps officers in 1929 academy members in a joint venture with the university of southern california created america x27 s first film school to further the art and science of moving pictures the school x27 s founding faculty included fairbanks d. w. griffith william c. demille ernst lubitsch irving thalberg darryl f. zanuck.1930 saw another move to 7046 hollywood boulevard in order to accommodate the enlarging staff by december of that year the library was acknowledged as x22 having one of the most complete collections of information on the motion picture industry anywhere in existence x22 they would remain at that location until 1935 when further growth would cause them to move once again this time the administrative offices would move to one location to the taft building at the corner of hollywood and vine while the library would move to 1455 north gordon street in 1934 the academy began publication of the screen achievement records bulletin which today is known as the motion picture credits database this is a list of film credits up for an academy award as well as other films released in los angeles county using research materials from the academy x27 s margaret her screen actors guild the screen actors guild was an american labor union which represented over 100,000 film and television principal and background performers worldwide on march 30 2012 the union leadership announced that the sag membership voted to merge with the american federation of television and radio artists to create sag-aftra according to sag x27 s mission statement the guild sought to negotiate and enforce collective bargaining agreements that establish equitable levels of compensation and working conditions for its performers the guild was founded in 1933 in an effort to eliminate what were described as exploitation of hollywood actors who were being forced into oppressive multi-year contracts with the major movie studios opposition to these contracts included that they did not include restrictions on work hours or minimum rest periods had clauses that automatically renewed at the studios x27 discretion these contracts were notorious for allowing the studios to dictate the public and private lives of the performers who signed them most did not have provisions to allow the performer to end the deal the screen actors guild was associated with the associated actors and artistes of america the primary association of performer x27 s unions in the united states aaaa is affiliated with the afl x2013 cio sag claimed exclusive jurisdiction over motion picture performances shared jurisdiction of radio television and other new media with its sister union aftra with which it shared 44,000 dual members internationally the sag was affiliated with the international federation of actors in addition to its main offices in hollywood sag maintained local branches in several major us cities including atlanta chicago denver honolulu las vegas nashville new york city new orleans phoenix salt lake city san diego san francisco and washington d. c. since 1995 the guild annually awarded the screen actors guild awards which are considered an indicator of success at the academy awards this award is continued by sag-aftra in 1925 the masquers club was formed by actors discontented with the grueling work hours at the hollywood studios this was one of the major concerns which led to the creation of the screen actors guild in 1933 another was that the academy of motion picture arts and sciences which at that time arbitrated between the producers and actors on contract disputes had a membership policy by invitation only a meeting in march 1933 of six actors led to the guild x27 s foundation three months three of the six and eighteen others became the guild x27 s first officers and board of directors ralph morgan alden gay kenneth thomson alan mowbray leon ames tyler brooke clay clement james gleason lucile webster gleason boris karloff claude king noel madison reginald mason bradley page willard robertson ivan simpson c. aubrey smith charles starrett richard tucker arthur vinton morgan wallace and lyle talbot many high-profile actors refused to join sag initially this changed when the producers made an agreement amongst themselves not to bid competitively for talent a pivotal meeting at the home of frank morgan was prompted by eddie cantor x27 s insistence at that meeting that any response to that producer x27 s agreement help all actors not just the established ones it took only three weeks for sag membership to go from around 80 members to more than 4,000 cantor x27 s participation was critical because of his friendship with the elected president franklin d. roosevelt after several years and the passage of the national labor relations act the producers agreed to negotiate with sag in 1937 actors known for their early support of sag include edward arnold humphrey bogart james cagney
