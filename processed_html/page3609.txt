ROGERS COUNTY, Okla. (KTUL) - The Oklahoma Highway Patrol responded to a fatal motorcycle accident involving a semi on Highway 412 Tuesday morning.{\/p} Trooper Dwight Durant said a semi turned from 305th East Avenue in front of the motorcycle around 6:30 a.m. The semi driver did not see the motorcyclist coming. {\/p} A witness said the driver of the motorcycle tried to stop but hit the back of the semi. The morning's thick fog made it difficult to see, according to Durant.{\/p} The motorcyclist died on scene. The victim's name was not released.{\/p} The east and westbound lanes were down to one lane while troopers worked the scene.{\/p}"}},"section":{"uuid":"34cf20ab-4fa1-4a55-ae41-dc87c8eff9d3","created":1438034267000,"version":1,"savedDate":null,"scheduledDate":null,"expiresDate":null,"terminatedDate":null,"publishAuthorizationDate":1551766972000,"unpublishAuthorizationDate":null,"status":"published","propertyTags":null,"zipcode":null,"timezone":null,"name":"Local","pathUrl":"\/local","redirectPathUrl":null,"config":null,"parentChannelProperty":{"uuid":"a3e739cf-be62-41a0-a101-568ac2c1b66b","created":1438034250000,"version":1,"savedDate":null,"scheduledDate":null,"expiresDate":null,"terminatedDate":null,"publishAuthorizationDate":null,"unpublishAuthorizationDate":null,"status":null,"propertyTags":null,"zipcode":"74101","timezone":"CDT","name":"KTUL","channelBrand":null},"parentSection":{"uuid":"6a7074e9-2333-41ae-9453-64c78f333845","created":1438034251000,"version":1,"savedDate":null,"scheduledDate":null,"expiresDate":null,"terminatedDate":null,"publishAuthorizationDate":1551766758000,"unpublishAuthorizationDate":null,"status":null,"propertyTags":null,"zipcode":null,"timezone":null,"name":"News","pathUrl":"\/news","redirectPathUrl":"\/","config":null,"parentChannelProperty":{"uuid":"a3e739cf-be62-41a0-a101-568ac2c1b66b","created":1438034250000,"version":1,"savedDate":null,"scheduledDate":null,"expiresDate":null,"terminatedDate":null,"publishAuthorizationDate":null,"unpublishAuthorizationDate":null,"status":null,"propertyTags":null,"zipcode":"74101","timezone":"CDT","name":"KTUL","channelBrand":null},"parentSection":{"uuid":"fe2c3ecf-2d7e-437e-bf45-a2129303adc3","created":1438034251000,"version":1,"savedDate":null,"scheduledDate":null,"expiresDate":null,"terminatedDate":null,"publishAuthorizationDate":null,"unpublishAuthorizationDate":null,"status":null,"propertyTags":null,"zipcode":null,"timezone":null,"name":"Root","pathUrl":"\/","redirectPathUrl":null,"config":null,"parentChannelProperty":{"uuid":"a3e739cf-be62-41a0-a101-568ac2c1b66b","created":1438034250000,"version":1,"savedDate":null,"scheduledDate":null,"expiresDate":null,"terminatedDate":null,"publishAuthorizationDate":null,"unpublishAuthorizationDate":null,"status":null,"propertyTags":null,"zipcode":"74101","timezone":"CDT","name":"KTUL","channelBrand":null},"parentSection":null,"templateId":"blank","parentSite":null,"children":null,"presentations":null,"indexPresentation":null,"adZone":null,"geminiAdUnitIOS":null,"geminiAdUnitAndroid":null,"order":null,"locked":null,"imageUrl":null,"sectionLink":null,"sectionLinkText":null,"data":null},"templateId":"home-News3","parentSite":null,"children":null,"presentations":null,"indexPresentation":null,"adZone":null,"geminiAdUnitIOS":null,"geminiAdUnitAndroid":null,"order":null,"locked":null,"imageUrl":null,"sectionLink":null,"sectionLinkText":null,"data":null},"templateId":"section-News3_v1","parentSite":null,"children":null,"presentations":null,"indexPresentation":null,"adZone":"news\/local","geminiAdUnitIOS":null,"geminiAdUnitAndroid":null,"order":99,"locked":false,"imageUrl":null,"sectionLink":null,"sectionLinkText":null,"data":{"injectedMarkup":""}},"aud_story_detail":{"component":{"data":[]},"data":[],"componentInstanceId":"aud_story_detail"},"page-data":[],"DOTfeed":null}} sinclairDigital.facade = JSON.parse(document.querySelector('script[data-prerender="facade"]').innerHTML);

ROGERS COUNTY, Okla. (KTUL) - The Oklahoma Highway Patrol responded to a fatal motorcycle accident involving a semi on Highway 412 Tuesday morning.{\/p} Trooper Dwight Durant said a semi turned from 305th East Avenue in front of the motorcycle around 6:30 a.m. The semi driver did not see the motorcyclist coming. {\/p} A witness said the driver of the motorcycle tried to stop but hit the back of the semi. The morning's thick fog made it difficult to see, according to Durant.{\/p} The motorcyclist died on scene. The victim's name was not released.{\/p} The east and westbound lanes were down to one lane while troopers worked the scene.{\/p}"},"rendering":{"adZone":"news\/local","webAdZoneRoot":"Web","mobileAdZoneRoot":"Mobile","dfpNetworkId":"4756","dfpAdUnitId":"KTUL","faviconImageUrl":"\/resources\/assets\/ktul\/images\/logos\/favicon.ico","pageTitle":"Motorcyclist

(KTUL) - The Oklahoma Highway Patrol responded to a fatal motorcycle accident involving a semi on Highway 412 Tuesday morning. Trooper Dwight Durant said a semi turned from 305th East Avenue in front of the motorcycle around 6:30 a.m. The semi driver did not see the motorcyclist coming.  A witness said the driver of the motorcycle tried to stop but hit the back of the semi. The morning ' s thick fog made it difficult to see, according to Durant. The motorcyclist died on scene. The victim ' s name was not released. The east and westbound lanes were down to one lane while troopers worked the scene.
