is it worth checking beans for stones seasoned advice by using our site you acknowledge that you have read and understand our cookie policy privacy policy and our terms of service i 've heard from many sources to check beans for stones before soaking/cooking them i 've been cooking with beans for years mostly black beans chickpeas and lentils and i 've never encountered a stone before or after cooking is the stone thing a myth or no longer the case with modern agricultural technology i 've found stones in dried beans so it 's no myth not common but i 'd say i find one every year or two if you simply swallowed a small stone it would almost certainly pass without harm but as tfd pointed out in his comment biting down on one could be an expensive and painful dental experience what i do is spread the beans out on a kitchen towel in a single layer for dark beans i use a light-colored towel and vice-versa for light beans it 's very easy to spot any foreign objects that way and it takes less than a minute so it 's worth doing in my opinion you can then easily toss the beans into a pot by just picking up the four corners of the towel and dumping them in i should add that i 've found little balls of dried dirt far more often than actual stones those would most likely dissolve and get washed away when you rinsed the beans but it demonstrates that stones can be in there in mexico i get stones all the time thankfully they are normally not as hard my teeth so i hav n't broken a tooth yet i hav n't had this occur in canada only when buying them in mexico almost every pack has atleast one if not more flor de maya was the most recent one i got stones in i think it is more common in mexico quite to the contrary it is the modern agricultural technology that causes the stones modern methods would mean of the past 50-60 years and longer-combines have been used for many many years now hand harvesting would of course be picking beans right of the vine would not yield any stones when i make pintos i find no less than 5-6 stones when i make field peas i do n't find anything what 's the difference pintos are store bought field peas are home grown hand processed click here to upload your image max 2 mib cancel and add another image you can also provide a link from the web log in by clicking post your answer you agree to our terms of service privacy policy and cookie policy 2019 stack exchange inc
