Pirate Ship of Tosa? - Kochi - Japan Travel Pirates of the Caribbean! Sea fog like steam rising from hot water Fishing boat gliding over the foggy sea The island on the left is not  ' treasure island ' , but Futana Island A fishing boat fades in and out of view in a sea of cloud I lost visibility whenever the sea fog enveloped me I was impressed that the fishing boat kept moving in a zero-visibility sea fog I visited Furusato (Hometown) Beach of Nakatosa Town in Kochi Prefecture on 11th December 2011 to take photos of the sunrise over a foggy sea. Even in Tosa, which is in the southern part of Japan, an early morning in mid December around sunrise was freezing cold! The difference of sub-zero air temperature and the warmer sea water creates the sea fog I came to see. The sunrise painted the fog in red and gold, and the fishing boats looked like mysterious pirate ships as they glided through the fog. I felt like I was watching a scene from a Hollywood movie, maybe  ' Pirates of the Caribbean ' . Magical Sea of Tosa 1.  Sunrise Over the Foggy Ocean 2.  Pirate Ship of Tosa?

Suggest an edit             I was born in and grew up in Tokushima prefecture, and have lived in many places since then: Nishinomiya, Kyoto, Nara, Mie, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, Fukuoka and Fukui. I am currently living in Yokohama City. All the places I lived, all the places I visited, I have loved dearly. The historical places where people lived, loved, suffered, and fought - places where I can still hear their heartbeats - mesmerize me. I ' d like to retrace the footsteps of the people who lived in Japan a long long time ago, and introduce to you what they left behind on this soil.
