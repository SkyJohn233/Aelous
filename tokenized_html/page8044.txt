held that for the offences committed during theperiod october 2002 to september 2014 the adjudicating officer sebi has no power to exercise discretion under section 15j of thesebi act 1992 for deciding the quantum of penalty and therefore failure to furnish the required document report or return to sebiwould attract a penalty of rs 1 lakh for each day of such failureor rs 1 crore whichever is less as per the said order theintention of the legislature amending the sebi act was to imposeharsher penalties for certain offence and therefore the courtfound no reason to water them down the

apex court oninvolving a similar question of law in the case of siddharthchaturvedi v sebi by an order dated march 14 2016 thedivision bench expressed its disagreement over the interpretationof law laid down by the roofit judgment and observed that ifinterpretation taken in the roofit case is correct it would bedifficult for section 15j to be construed as a reasonableprovision as it would then arbitrarily and disproportionatelyinvade the appellants fundamental rights the matter has fornow been referred to a larger bench of the apex court government of india and sebi have been equally concerned overthe law down by the roofit judgment and have been hoping for viablesolution from the larger bench of the apex court since there is nocertainty as to when the larger bench of the supreme court wouldtake up the said matter goi in consultation with sebi has takenrecourse to the legislative route so as to break the deadlockcreated by the two conflicting views of the hon ble supremecourt

invest in indian stock market withoutregistering themselves with sebi in addition to checks andbalances which were in place with respect to issue of p notes sebihas on may 29 2017 suggested various new proposals to furthertighten norms pertaining to issuance of overseas derivativeinstruments which measures including sebi substantial acquisition of shares takeovers regulations 2011 takeoverregulations provide that if any person togetherwith persons acting in concert with him acquires voting rights orcontrol in a target company in excess of the threshold limitsstipulated under the regulations he is required to provide an exitopportunity to other shareholders of the target company by makingan open offer in accordance with the takeover regulations.regulation 10 1 a ii of the takeover regulations exempts theaforesaid obligation if the acquisition made pursuant to inter setransfer of shares amongst qualifying persons inter alia includingpersons who have been named as promoters in theshareholding pattern filed by the target company in terms of thelisting agreement or takeover regulations for not less than threeyears prior to the proposed acquisition against the above background the question that arises iswhether the period of being disclosed as promoter of the targetcompany prior to getting listed could be considered for the purposeof computing the aforesaid period of three years prior to theproposed acquisition in other words whether inter se promotertransfers could be made under regulation 10 1 a ii prior tocompletion of three years of listing the securities appellate tribunal sat by its recent order dated april5 2016 passed in the matter of arbutus consultancy llpvs sebi appeal no 123 of 2016 has after thoroughlyexamining the issue answered the question in the negative andobserved that it is irrelevant whether the same promoterswere holding the same shares for over a long period either in thetarget company or in the parent company or both prior to listingthe target company the only relevant factor is date of listing thetarget company and the promoter holding filed by the target companyas part of the listing agreement during the course of the arguments another interesting questionof law which emerged was whether the informal guidance given bysebi would be binding on it as per the appellant one of the reasons for undertaking theimpugned inter se promoter transfer by it was on account of theinformal guidance given by sebi vide its letter dated october 25,2012 in the matter of weizmann forexlimited wherein on facts similar to the presentappeal sebi had opined that transfer of shares would be eligiblefor exemption under regulation 10 1 a ii this opinion however was superseded by another informal guidance given by sebisubsequently in the matter of commercial engineers andbody builders company ltd. which was also availablein the public domain on the same issue at the relevant time whenthe appellants acquired shares through inter se promotertransfers sebi relied upon the subsequent informal guidance and submittedthat official of sebi had erred in the weizmann guidance byinadvertently providing an interpretation in the spirit of takeoverregulations 1997 oblivious of the changes that happened in termsof takeover regulations 2011 and that such a mistake made by anofficer of the respondent can not be used to furtherance of themistake it was further argued by sebi that when the statute isclear informal guidance should not be relied on and that theinformal guidance issued by sebi is the view of the concerneddepartment of sebi and can not be said to be binding on the sebiboard according to sebi the informal guidance should not beconstrued as a conclusive decision or determination of any questionof law or fact by sebi and that such a letter can not be construedas an order of sebi under section 15t of the sebi act after hearing the parties at length sat came to the conclusionthat an interpretation provided under informal guidance by anofficial of the department of sebi can not be used against thecorrect interpretation of law sat also placed reliance on theorder passed by it on august 28 2009 in the matter of deepak mehra v. sebi wherein the legalityof informal guidance was examined by sat and held that informalguidance was the view of the department of sebi and can not beconstrued as law in a nutshell for the purpose of reckoning the period of beingnamed as a promoter in the shareholding pattern of the targetcompany for claiming exemption under takeover regulations the samewill be deemed to commence from the date of the targetcompany s listing major takeaway from the sat s order isthat a party can not blindly rely upon the informal guidance givenby sebi in some earlier case if sebi s opinion is patentlyfaulty vis-à-vis clear provisions of the statute on thatpoint to prevent the market participants from erring by relying onsebi s informal guidance it is expected that sebi willstrengthen its internal mechanism to ensure that its informalguidance given in any manner is legally sound and tenable whiletechnically sebi board may not be bound by the view of itsdepartment repeated rejection of informal guidance at a later datecould seriously dent the sanctity of such opinion consequently the market participants could lose confidence in the mechanismwhich was evolved to provide guidance in a highly complexregulatory regime of securities market it is not clear what would have been the outcome of the matterif the appellant itself had taken the informal guidance in its caseand sebi had tried to take a different position later on.certainly if in such a situation also one is not certain thenperhaps no purpose is being served by the informal guidancescheme on may 12 2017 the adjudicating officer sebi has not viewedthe technical non-disclosure under regulation 13 1 of insidertrading regulations as a breach of the said regulations in view ofthe fact that the noticee had made similar disclosure aboutacquisition of shares under regulations 29 1 of sebi sastregulations 2011 in the instant case the noticee had made timely disclosuresunder 29 1 of the sast regulations but failed to make disclosuresunder regulation 13 1 of insider trading regulations in thisregard the noticee contended that the disclosure under regulation13 1 of insider trading regulations and regulation 29 1 of sastregulations 2011 are substantially the same and since the noticeehad already complied with disclosures requirement under regulation29 1 of sast regulations 2011 it should be treated assufficient disclosures under regulation 13 1 of insider tradingregulations the ao held that both the disclosures under regulation29 1 of sast regulations 2011 and regulation 13 1 of insidertrading regulations are quite similar in nature and that theintention of both the regulations is dissemination of information.on filing of said disclosures under regulation 29 1 of sastregulations 2011 the essential information about the saidacquisition of shares had already been disseminated to the generalpublic and therefore in such circumstances the noticee havingcomplied with regulation 29 1 of sast regulations 2011 thenon-compliance of regulation 13 1 of insider trading regulationsought not be viewed seriously and be visited with any penalty the above order may be a relief for such market participants whomay have made necessary disclosure under one of the two regulationsbut have inadvertently failed to make corresponding disclosureunder the other regulations the content of this article is intended to provide a generalguide to the subject matter specialist advice should be soughtabout your specific circumstances
