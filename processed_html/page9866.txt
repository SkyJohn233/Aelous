swallows and amazons   intheboatshed.net intheboatshed.net Gavin Atkin ' s weblog for the sort of people who like looking inside boat sheds. It ' s about old boats, traditional boats, boat building, restoration, the sea and the North Kent Coast Weblogger, author and TV producer  Sophie Neville unpicks the real story behind the legend of Captain Flint s houseboat . When people see the  SY Gondola  on Coniston today, in all her re-built glory, she seems rather plush to have been cast by Arthur Ransome as Captain Flint’s houseboat. The main reason for assuming that she was used as the model for the illustrations is because Arthur Ransome grabbed a post card of the  Gondola  and drew on it to give the first illustrators of  Swallows and Amazons  some idea of his vision. However Ransome’s biographer Roger Wardale tells me it was a former steamer on Windermere that he had in mind: the  S L Esperance .

She later was the model for the boat Amazon featured in some of the Ransome s popular children s novels, beginning with   Swallows and Amazons , which he wrote in 1929. The Altounyan family children featured in the fictional stories under their own names, and one, Roger Altounyan, later invented the cromoglycate inhaler used to treat asthma   an achievement for which us asthmatics will be forever grateful. In real life the sailing dinghy was named  Mavis , and was renamed  Amazon  in 1990 by Aruthur Ransome Society president Mrs Brigit Sanders, who appeared in the books as the character  the Ship s Baby . Amazon  still belongs to the Altounyan family, but is on long-term loan to the  Ruskin Museum  at Coniston and is on show. Amazon is not varnished as described in Ransome s famous books, but was probably painted from the beginning   it s said that she probably looks today very much as she did when Ransome knew her. Ransome himself remains a complex and intriguing character   as his  Wikipedia entry  shows.     The fourth  Coniston Regatta 2013  runs from Thursday 30th May to the Saturday the 1st June, and everyone is invited   including traditional boat owners and their boats. Organiser  Greg Simpson  has been in touch to say that among the boats booked in so far include a 1930s  Peterborough canoe , a 1910s  Thames sailing skiff , and numerous  steam launches  and model boats. The events are based at the  English Lake District  home of  Swallows  &  Amazons ,  Bank Ground Farm  which in the book is called  Holly Howe  and is the holiday home where the Swallows stayed each summer. Attractions for boating enthusiasts and kids include exhibition stands presented by  Windermere Steamboat Museum ,  Good Wood Boatbuilders ,  Patterson Boatworks  and various other local craftsmen, and steam engines. SY Gondola  and  Coniston Launch  will be available for trips, there will be boats for hire and some boat owners attending the regatta will be offering sailing trips. Children will enjoy a kids  fishing competition and a miniature railway. The tea rooms open from 11am each day. There are also a range of evening entertainments, including an outdoor screening of a film version of Swallows and Amazons.
