4 key metrics to measure engagement success on instagram nimble marketing consultancy instagram oh instagram in the last few hours you have literally introduced new features that have compelled me to believe that you are indeed on a mission to take over the world in just a week alone you rolled out igtv and hear this a few hours ago you have been quietly testing and rolling out your latest little feature music stickers on everyone else but the users of our singapore region boo so while everyone in the united states is having a heck load of fun with these music stickers and tagging ed sheeran s shape of you on anything and everything that excites them on instastory sad little ol me is wondering how in the world do i growth hack nimble s engagement on instagram without these utterly cute supremely random but much needed music stickers that s me on one of my favourite social media accounts and super envious that we don t have the ability to add music to our stories because if there is anything about instagram that every business owner should know is the fact that instagram is an overloaded confetti of surprises you are either with the party or reallyâ€¦a case of the lost wallflower and i am on a mission to make sure that my girls and i are not left behind the pack especially when it comes to the issue of engagement on instagram because as i have mentioned numerous times before in our nimble workshops on social media you be social because you can t do social and you most definitely can not force engagement right out of the depths of an audience who have never heard of you or your business before in recent months i have personally found instagram to be more intuitive and a relatable platform to reach our audience and to be very honest i am thoroughly enjoying it too which is honestly quite rare especially when social media is a 9-5 job most times it s a 12-hour shift we take social very seriously in our agency and by serious we mean measuring our efforts against data like click-throughs coming to bit.ly or link.tree website traffic and of course the ultimate form of engagement that helps drive business outcomes- conversions this could come in a myriad of forms but typically for us at nimble we consider this to be the number of sign-ups we get to any of our workshops forever grateful and thankful to all our nimble graduates who believe in our mission to empower you to be more sociallytechsavvy and we do everything in our nimble prowess to ensure that whatever social network that gets into our hands and entrusted to us by our clients we make sure it turns solid gold so while i struggle to find peace in a noisy space like social media i genuinely am so proud of the work that we do on instagram and how i am convinced that as a team we have finally yes finally found our secret sauce to help attain and retain engagement from our audience on instagram not an easy feat but indefinitely doable if well you continue to read on because instagram is a huge opportunity to pivot engagement instagram has given us as a business an immense opportunity to take our brand personality from unknown marketers from changi north and completely blow us out of the water simply because it is a platform that allowed us to be that much closer to you today i saw something on gary vaynerchuck s instastory that got me thinking oh wow so true big gary fan here anyone else attention is the currency suddenly it all made sense to me while i argue for days not having the damn music stickers let alone the ability to repost stories we have been mentioned on by others on our ig stories yup yet to be rolled out to us i realise very quickly that while marketing is natural to us as a team building an audience from the ground up takes time effort and unconditional patience in other words super hard work ladies this then becomes a basis for understanding what is true engagement on social media while engagement has historically been a common metric for evaluating social media performance it is important to take note that it doesn t necessarily translate to sales i speak about this many times at our nimble workshops and potentially have sounded like a mad woman on a mission to demystify myths surrounding social media like more followers likes more sales wow did i just concoct a formula to get you to understand the nuts and bolts of our industry because i can guarantee you that as soon as business owners comprehend that a social network is merely a vehicle to be best used to build an audience- then the sooner you know how to pivot your engagement efforts with your audience trust me gary is right attention is indeed the only currency on social media that matters and what this means in simple math is attention equates to value there is no denying that value comes in many forms on social media the mistake most business owners make is to put their eggs all in one basket in this case depending highly and solely on social media to help them make a sale while it is not impossible to get a sale from our audience or converting them to actual paying clients most business owners not only lack the appreciation of their audience but disappointingly refuse to understand them enough to know the value they require and need this then becomes a question of what kind of content resonates well with your audience and building a content stream specific to them and this is what gary means attention to the minute detail as to how much value you can give to your audience on a platform that celebrates content sharing in other words while likes and follows are typical vanity metrics most of these measures in isolation are not a reflection of the overarching macro engagement you so desire on social media so stop fussing the value of attention we came on board to instagram late 2016 and i am not going to lie- had no idea ourselves how to grow our influence on this social network it was confusing designing felt daunting captioning felt so bloody hard numerous times we debated over the kind of brand voice we seek to project to whoever that bothered to listen i had absolutely no audience then and instagram was a hotbed for the passing wind. should we sound like an egotistical press release every time we were out there on insta-land formal seriously serious about delivering social media tips tactical strategic emotionless and straight to the point oh yes we were exactly that we are so experienced in our field or at least i would like to think that we are that the mistake we made was to do exactly that telling everyone that we are so damn experienced in our field big mistake no one gave us two hoots about who we were let alone the work that we do or could do in other words we were boring as hell i missed the boat because in marketing 101 you never ever sell and like a seasoned marketer again at least i hope i am i pivoted fast i knew that if i wanted to growth hack my own engagement i needed to pay attention to the real value that my audience seeks what do they seek what do they want what do they hope to receive from me this is why business owners must understand that content marketing s objective is to build an audience that can later be harvested into enthusiastic customers no one wanted to buy from me heck no one even knew what i sold as soon as we put ourselves out there as vulnerable human beings our engagement grew we showed to well some 100 odd people on instagram that there were real people behind the nimble team that it was us the test of the pudding success on instagram requires a very careful concerted and conscious effort it was important for me to make our guests on instagram feel absolutely welcome to our nimble universe because in our universe we celebrate the femtelligence in every single woman entrepreneur we transform you into avid lovers of social media and help you do better business because of it we are energetic warm and approachable on instagram because we are genuinely like that so
