love the relative diversity higher level of social awareness walkability food access to nature there is still a bit of gold coast that you have to roll your eyes at but for the most part there s a lot of really good people we went from late-20s young professionals to 30s parents of a young child during our four years so far in fairfield both experiences were/have been great each neighborhood in fairfield has a really distinct personality so i would do some additional research to see what neighborhood fits for you we love that we can walk to 6 parks/playgrounds 5 beaches hiking trails fishing a library that rivals some children s museums national-act concerts the train to nyc or new haven at the same time we have our own driveway and backyard where i can garden have a bonfire with friends over without imposing on neighbors the town amenities services are great much better than other area towns- tax actually worth it read 91 reviews current resident xa0 tarifville is a wonderful town it it wonderfully quiet and has great parks and recreational areas to visit i used to live in the city and this was a refreshing change read 1 review current resident xa0 love the school system the community is relaxed residents place a high value on the natural environment you can hike for 60 miles on open space and be to the best malls and dining within 15 minutes 60 minutes door to door drive to mid-town or you can take the train from redding station going direct to grand central in peak hours takes a little longer but i read a book or the morning paper or get ahead on my email so worth it
