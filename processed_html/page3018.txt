Detroit Pistons: 25 Best Players To Play For The Pistons - Page 24 SALT LAKE CITY, UNITED STATES: Grant Hill (R) of the Detroit Pistons backs down Quincy Lewis of the Utah Jazz during their match 19 February, 2000 in Salt Lake City, Utah. (GEORGE FREY/AFP/Getty Images) Grant Hill  made a steady climb through a four-year career at Duke that included national championships as a freshman and sophomore, All-America honors as a junior and senior and concluded with another appearance in the national final. The  Detroit Pistons  selected Hill with the third overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft and his rise to stardom in the pros was meteoric. Hill shared Rookie of the Year honors in 1994-95 with  Jason Kidd  of the  Dallas Mavericks , who had been taken one pick ahead of him. He was a five-time All-NBA selection with the Pistons and a five-time All-Star, finishing third in the MVP voting in 1996-97. Hill was third in the NBA in scoring in 1999-2000 and was third in minutes per game in both 1995-96 and 1997-98. In August 2000, Hill was sent to the  Orlando Magic  in a sign-and-trade deal in exchange for  Chucky Atkins  and  Ben Wallace . In six seasons in Detroit, Hill averaged 21.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.3 assists and 1.6 steals in 39.1 minutes per game, shooting .476/.256/.746. But an ankle injury sustained in the 2000 NBA Playoffs with the Pistons would plague Hill throughout his stay in Orlando. He was an All-Star in 2001 and 2005, but missed huge chunks of time while having procedure after procedure done on the balky joint. Hill didn’t play at all in 2003-04, missed 53 games in 2002-03, 61 in 2005-06, 68 in 2001-02 and 78 in 2000-01. Hill signed with the  Phoenix Suns  as a free agent in July 2007 and enjoyed a bit of a career renaissance before leaving to sign with the  Los Angeles Clippers  in July 2012. He retired in June 2013 and is now a minority owner of the  Atlanta Hawks , who were purchased by a group headed by Anthony Ressler in June 2015.

Fred Zollner was the owner of Zollner Corporation and was pursuaded to start a professional basketball team in Fort Wayne, Ind. < \/p>\n Thus the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons were born in 1941 as part of the old National Basketball League. The Zollner Pistons played seven years in that circuit, winning league championships in 1944 and 1945, before jumping to the upstart Basketball Association of America in 1948. < \/p>\n The Zollner Pistons were an impressive 166-71, a .700 winning percentage, in their time in the NBL, reaching the playoffs each season. < \/p>\n .theiaPostSlider_nav._lower {display: none !important} < \/style> Related Story:  50 Greatest NBA Players Without a Championship < \/span> < \/a> < \/div>\n Upon moving to the BAA in 1948, the team name was shortened to Fort Wayne Pistons and the team continued to play its home games at Fort Wayne s North Side High School until 1952, when they moved into the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum. < \/p>\n The following season, the remnants of the NBL merged with the BAA to form what would be called the National Basketball Association. < \/p>\n \n\t\t\t More from  Detroit Pistons < \/span> < \/div>\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t How Andre Drummond became one of the game s all-time rebounders < \/a>\n\t\t\t\t < \/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Can new additions provide shooting Detroit Pistons need in 2019-20? < \/a>\n\t\t\t\t < \/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Detroit Pistons: 3 best acquisitions of the past 3 seasons < \/a>\n\t\t\t\t < \/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Detroit Pistons: 3 Reasons why signing Michael Beasley will pay off < \/a>\n\t\t\t\t < \/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Detroit Pistons: 3 players facing most pressure in 2019-20 < \/a>\n\t\t\t\t < \/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t < \/ul>\n\t < \/div>The club continued in Fort Wayne through the 1956-57 season, making the playoffs in every season but their first in the BAA and reaching the NBA Finals in both 1955 and 1956, falling to the Syracuse Nationals and Philadelphia Warriors, respectively. < \/p>\n Competing with markets the size of New York, Boston and Philadelphia proved too daunting for Zollner, who moved the team to Detroit for the 1957-58 season. < \/p>\n Detroit had been home to a charter franchise in the BAA, the Detroit Falcons, in 1946-47. That club folded after just one season. < \/p>\n The Pistons were a playoff team in each of their first six seasons playing at first Olympia Stadium and then Cobo Arena, which became their new home for the 1961-62 season. < \/p>\n Decades of struggles followed, as the team made the postseason just five times in a 20-year span from the 1963-64 season through 1982-83, including a franchise-record six-season drought from 1977-78 to 1982-83. < \/p>\n < \/iframe> < \/div>\n In 1978, the franchise moved to a new home, leaving downtown for the Pontiac Silverdome in the city s northern suburbs. In 1988, the Pistons opened The Palace of Auburn Hills, not far from the Silverdome, and have remained there ever since. < \/p>\n The Pistons rose to prominence in the mid-1980s, reaching the conference finals in 1987 for the first time since 1962 and getting to three straight NBA Finals from 1988-90 with a club known as the  Bad Boys  for its tough demeanor and hard-nosed play. < \/p>\n Detroit lost in 1988 to the  Los Angeles Lakers < \/a> before turning the tables on the club that won five titles in the 1980s the following season. A win over the  Portland Trail Blazers < \/a> in 1990 gave the Pistons back-to-back titles. < \/p>\n The club returned to contention in the early 21st century, reaching a record six consecutive conference finals from 2003-08 while winning the NBA title in 2004, again beating the Lakers, and losing a seven-game series to the  San Antonio Spurs < \/a> in 2005. < \/p>\n < \/iframe> < \/div>\n More struggles ensued shortly thereafter, as the Pistons tied their franchise mark by missing the playoff six straight years from 2010-15 before getting back to the postseason in 2015-16. < \/p>\n In 68 NBA seasons, the Pistons are 2,616-2,752, a .487 winning percentage that places them 19th among the 30 active NBA teams. < \/p>\n Detroit won a franchise-record 64 games in 2005-06. They have topped the 60-win plateau just one other time, in 1988-89. < \/p>\n On the other end of the spectrum, the Pistons have three 60-loss seasons, with the worst being a 16-66 debacle in 1979-80. The club lost 62 games in 1993-94 and 61 games in 1980-81. < \/p>\n There have been 18 general managers in team history. The longest tenured was former Pistons guard  Joe Dumars < \/a> < \/strong>, who was on the job from June 2000 through April 2014. < \/p>\n < \/iframe> < \/div>\n Jack McCloskey < \/a> < \/strong> held the post from December 1979 through June 1992 and Edwin Coil manned it from October 1965 through June 1975. < \/p>\n Though Jeff Bower is listed as the general manager, president of basketball operations and head coach Stan Van Gundy makes the personnel decisions and has since being hired in May 2014 to both positions. < \/p>\n Dumars is the lone winner of the NBA Executive of the Year award for the franchise, taking the honor in 2002-03. < \/p>\n Van Gundy is the team s 35th head coach, with a record of 76-88 in the regular season and 0-4 in the playoffs since the start of the 2014-15 season. < \/p>\n Last year, the Pistons were 44-38 their first winning season since 2007-08 and were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the eventual champion  Cleveland Cavaliers < \/a>. < \/p>\n < \/iframe> < \/div>\n Hall of Famer Chuck Daly, who led Detroit to the back-to-back NBA titles in 1989 and 1990, is the only coach in franchise history with more than 200 wins, posting a record of 467-271 in the regular season and 71-42 in the playoffs from 1983-84 through 1991-92. < \/p>\n Daly, however, was never named Coach of the Year. Two Pistons coaches have won the award,  Ray Scott < \/a> < \/strong> in 1973-74 and  Rick Carlisle < \/a> < \/strong> in 2001-02. < \/p>\n The Pistons have held the No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft, just twice, selecting Providence s  Jimmy Walker < \/a> < \/strong> in 1967 and  Bob Lanier < \/a> < \/strong> of St. Bonaventure in 1970. < \/p>\n The club has had the No. 2 pick six times, has picked third four times and fourth in nine different drafts. They have never picked fifth. < \/p>\n Here are the 25 best players in the history of the Detroit Pistons. Players had to have appeared in 150 games and averaged a minimum of 20 minutes per game for the team to qualify for this list. < \/p>\n Next:  < \/span> West Virginia Wing An Early All-Star < \/span> < \/a> < \/div>
