Trammell Crow could build Austin's largest office tower on prime downtown block - Austin Business Journal City documents show an initial plan for the redevelopment of a prime downtown Austin block by Trammell Crow Co. The 36-story office tower would have 665,000 square feet of offices — making it the city's largest office skyscraper — plus restaurant and retail space. It's the first glimpse into the Dallas-based developer's vision for the coveted block just north of Chase Bank Tower, and was  first reported by Austin Towers . The 1.75-acre site — surrounded by Colorado, West Sixth, Lavaca and West Seventh streets — is owned by the University of Texas System. The UT System used to occupy offices on the site, although it has nearly finished relocating across the street to a new headquarters tower. The current tower and parking garage on the block will be demolished. However, the Trammell Crow plans would preserve much of the historic Claudia Taylor Johnson Hall. It's unknown what the building would be used for, but it would sit in the shadow of the skyscraper; Austin Towers speculates it could be used as an entrance for the tower. The remaining space on the block would be converted into an open plaza. Page Southerland Page is the architect on the project. The UT System last November  signed a long-term ground lease with Trammell Crow to develop so-called Block 71. At the time, system officials highlighted the company's financial strength, stability and history of development in Austin's Central Business District. Trammell Crow, which is owned by  CBRE  Group Inc.,  is also redeveloping the nearby Green Water Treatment Plant site  into a mixed-use site with residential, office and retail space. Block 71 is not in any Capitol view corridors, imaginary lines drawn by state lawmakers to protect views of the Texas Capitol building from various parts of the city and which restrict structure heights. A committee of Austin's Historic Landmark Commission has already reviewed the plans and made recommendations, which have been incorporated by the developer,  according to the Austin American-Statesman . The commission has also approved a demolition permit to raze the 1974 officer tower on the site.  2019 American City Business Journals. All rights reserved.
