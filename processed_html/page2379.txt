MSU Health and Dental Opt Out Deadline is Sept. 30 | MSU McMaster Students Union Undergraduate students who are enrolled in 18 units or more are automatically registered for our Health and Dental Plans, as these are included in your supplementary fees of your tuition. Are you covered under your parent ' s or spouse ' s plan? If so, you may opt-out of the Health and Dental plans. If you are covered by another health or dental plan, but you are not covered 100%, you may utilize your MSU Health and Dental plan coverage and combine it with your current plan. Look into your benefits and compare the two plans before you opt out, as the MSU plans may provide some coverage options that are not currently available to you. **Please note that if you are a Graduate Student, or a student at Mohawk College who isn ' t enrolled in the Bachelor of Technology program, you are not covered by the McMaster Students Union Health and Dental plan.** The opt-out period runs from  September 1 to September 30 , there are no exceptions to this deadline and we will not be taking requests.
