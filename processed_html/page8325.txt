We have shown previously that PTEN negatively controls the G1/S cell cycle transition and regulates thelevels of p27(KIP1), a CDK inhibitor [3, 4]. Recently, we and others haveidentified an ubiquitin E3 ligase, the SCF(SKP2) complex, that mediates p27ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis [5-7]. Here we report that PTEN and the PI3-kinase pathway regulate p27 protein stability. PTEN-deficiency in mouseembryonic stem (ES) cells causes a decrease of p27 levels with concomitantincrease of SKP2, a key component of the SCF(SKP2) complex. Conversely, in human glioblastoma cells, ectopic PTEN expression leads to p27 accumulation, which isaccompanied by a reduction of SKP2. We found that ectopic expression of SKP2alone is sufficient to reverse PTEN-induced p27 accumulation, restore the kinase activity of cyclin E/CDK2, and partially overcome the PTEN-induced G1 cell cycle arrest. Consistently, recombinant SCF(SKP2) complex or SKP2 protein alone canrescue the defect in p27 ubiquitination in extracts prepared from cells treatedwith a PI 3-kinase inhibitor. Our findings suggest that SKP2 functions as acritical component in the PTEN/PI 3-kinase pathway for the regulation ofp27(KIP1) and cell proliferation. ><
