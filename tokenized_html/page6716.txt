respect is at risk this is because the same technology that can be a positive force for the discursive values underlying democracy can also be a tool of control the same technology that facilitates discourse creates opportunities for censorship of information monitoring of online practices and the subtle shaping and manipulation of behaviour this is not to say that the architecture of the internet does not somewhat determine how it is used 1 but ultimately the internet is neutral in the face of the human agents that control its use as kofi annan stated in 2003 w hile technology shapes the future it is people who shape technology and decide to what uses it can and should be put 2 in this chapter i explore the positive aspects of technology the purpose is to identify for the reader the internet s potential and what is at stake if we do not intervene to secure the requisite freedoms into the internet s governance structure this grounds the book s inquiry into the role of private gatekeepers in facilitating or hindering this democratic potential through their control of the pathways of communication based on a theory developed by jack balkin the internet s democratic potential will be argued to be rooted in its ability to promote democratic culture threaded through this argument will be the centrality of communication to democracy in saying that the internet has the potential to be a democratising force what will be asserted is that the internet can help facilitate deliberation and participation in the forms of meaning-making in democratic society the distinction between the internet having potential to be a democratising force and its achieving it must be noted at the outset attempts have been made to prove empirically that the internet facilitates democracy but such studies are compromised by the numerous variables present 3 the goal of this chapter is more modestly to identify democratic culture as the type of democracy that the internet can facilitate and to explicate the characteristics of the internet that give it this potential this chapter sets up the broader investigation of this book into our reliance for facilitation of the internet s democratic potential on privately owned internet information gatekeepers iigs the term iig will be defined and examined in detail in chapter 2 briefly it means a gatekeeper which facilitates or hinders deliberation and participation in the forms of meaning-making in democratic culture every time we use the internet we engage with iigs to find information we use search engines to access the internet we need to use internet service providers isp to be able to participate on message boards or social networking sites we go through a host 4 the role of such regulators has not yet been settled and as of yet they do not have any democratic or public interest mandate 5 that assures the internet s democratic potential is being facilitated if the internet is a democratising force we inevitably at present must rely on these iigs for the realisation of this aspect of its capacity it is argued in this book that the corporate social responsibility csr frameworks that currently govern the activities of iigs are insufficient to meet their human rights obligations and that without intervention the continuation of their work in its current mode will hamper the ability of the internet to work as a tool of democracy to that end this chapter first orients the reader with a history of the rise and fall of the concept of the internet as a democratising force it then examines the elastic concept of democracy and articulates the substance and appropriateness of democratic culture as the type of democracy most capable of facilitation by the internet this includes an analysis of the narrower and for our purposes ill-fitting concept of deliberative democracy most famously discussed by jürgen habermas last this chapter looks more closely at the ways that the internet is promoting democratic culture and the criticisms thereof focusing on the internet s facilitation of information access and participation in politics and culture the internet was celebrated in its infancy as a democratising force its decentralised structure invited anti-establishment-type rhetoric arguing that it was uncontrollable by governments and that it was a new space outside of legal institutions and territoriality 6 information wants to be free 7 was the slogan this optimism was reflected by the courts particularly in the united states with the u.s. supreme court noting the increasingly important role of the internet in facilitating communication in democratic society 8 in aclu v. reno 9 one opinion famously described the internet as a vast library which anyone can access and a platform from which anyone can publish continuing that anyone can become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox 10 in the late 1990s however the reality of the internet s regulability began to crush cyberlibertarian idealism discussions no longer centred on the internet as a democratising force and instead were about the forces waiting to clamp down on it with publications by joel reidenberg 11 and lawrence lessig 12 a new constraint was recognised it was not just governments and laws that regulated behaviour but those entities inevitably private that controlled the technology – the code writers and engineers who as a result of their work delineated the environment of our social life 13 the message was that treating cyberspace as a separate place that will flourish if left alone by governments will not ensure the freedoms sought because that ignores the indirect ways that governments can regulate as well as the ways architecture can be harnessed by private parties to constrain behaviour we also witnessed the increased regulation of the internet by states which continues today 14 through the use of filtering and blocking technologies countries such as china and syria have developed tools to prevent their population accessing undesirable content china s filtering system is complex with the famous outer layer known as the great firewall of china blocking access at international gateways and the inner layer comprising internet companies required by the government to monitor and remove objectionable content 15 syria prevents access to the entire israeli.il domain and many other states routinely filter access to websites with pornography and dissident or human rights-oriented content 16 sites such as www.youtube.com are routinely blocked for example from 2007 to 2010 turkey blocked access to youtube sparked by the posting of videos deemed offensive to the memory of its founding father mustafa kemal ataturk 17 in 2014 turkey passed a controversial law allowing its telecommunications regulator to block access to websites without court order as a result in 2014 the authority blocked access to youtube and twitter the latter being overturned quickly by court order 18 saudi arabia now requires a licence to post content to youtube 19 during the protests across africa and the middle east in 2010 and 2011 filtering technologies were readily employed by states to block access to communication technologies that were seen as enabling and mobilising the protesters 20 filtering is not limited to asian or middle eastern countries germany blocks certain nazi/hate websites 21 the european union provides the framework for national-level notice and takedown regimes for unlawful content 22 russia has blocked access to news sites for what the government describes as calling for participation in authorised rallies 23 in 2014 the united kingdom implemented an opt-in filter through agreement with four major isps whereby access to content that is pornographic though legal is blocked unless a broadband user opts in with its provider to access such sites 24 naturally much material lies at the boundary of what would be blocked or material might be blocked accidentally such as sex education sites the government has also stated its intentions to extend the opt-in filter to extremist sites 25 companies such as bt have implemented such filters under the framework of parental controls in which new users now must opt in to a variety of content ranging from obscene content to content featuring nudity drugs and alcohol self-harm and dating sites 26 john palfrey would describe this as comprising the second and third phases of what he frames as four phases in the evolution of internet regulation 27 the first phase paralleling the preceding discussion was the phase of the open internet in which the internet was seen as a separate space outside of governmental and other legal control the second phase from 2000 to 2005 he describes as the access-denied phase in which the internet was seen by states as something to be managed this period was therefore characterised by the use of filtering technologies the third phase – access-controlled from 2005 to 2010 – was characterised by more nuanced and sophisticated forms of control often layered on other forms of regulation filters were still used but they could be targeted to particularly sensitive political events such as the filtering of a controversial photo from the tiananmen square massacre leading up to the twenty-year anniversary additionally it was characterised by the increasing use of private companies to regulate online content through data collection and sharing or blocking licensing schemes to publish online or a combination of filters combined with laws as seen in cases like twentieth century fox film corp ors v. british telecommunications plc 28 where a uk court ordered isps to block access to file-sharing sites we have moved into a new phase aptly described by one scholar as the time of the cyberrealists 29 where discussions of the internet as a democratising force are re-emerging but with more sophistication and less naivety than in the past partly this is due to the speed with which the internet is becoming the very things that the writers of the early 1990s forecast it would be the internet has quickly moved from primarily being used for information access to become a participatory environment more closely mimicking the democratic participation traditional in the physical world although this interactivity was available on the early internet in the form of message boards and the like they were not mainstream and did not offer the same range of tools available now this participative environment coined web 2.0 by tim o reilly 30 is difficult to define comprehensively although it is best captured by stephen fry s definition web 2.0 is an idea in people s heads rather than a reality it s actually an idea that the reciprocity between the user and the provider is what is emphasised in other words genuine interactivity if you like simply because people can upload as well as download 31 it is a notion that describes the maturing internet s combination of aspects of the telephone post office movie theatre television newspaper shopping mall and street corner 32 users are simultaneously creators and consumers of content 33 indeed it is this combination of public awareness increasing private power and the importance of the internet to daily life that defines palfrey s current and fourth phase of internet regulation he calls this the access-contested phase in which the regulation that states have imposed in the earlier phase is giving rise to strong responses from the private sector and from other states unhappy with this regulation … regulation online is increasingly a blend of the public and private 34 the key aspect of this period he posits will be the interplay among these various forms of regulation the internet will potentially become increasingly participatory as it continues to develop thus opening up increasing possibilities for democracy the next generation of the internet is the semantic web 35 in this future it is predicted that computers will be able to meaningfully read and process the data on networks such that if i input a question online the answer is customised to me data will be mashed together and information managed for you pictures you take might be linked to your calendar so that you know where and when you took them planned travel might trigger updates of your medical file and in the booking of flights car rentals and entertainment 36 the world wide web consortium sees the semantic web as a standardisation of two things first of the formats integrating and combining data and second of the languages used to relate data to the real world 37 it is within this interactive environment that we can readily identify opportunities for participation in democratic culture and identify the growing power of private gatekeepers to shape discourse every communication technology from the printing press to the radio has at one time been celebrated as having a democratising force but in this context few ask what is meant by democracy 38 this is compounded by the difficulty in defining the very idea of democracy depending so much as it invariably does on one s discipline or perspective it is an elastic concept that can be approached both as an institutional construct and as an aspiration it has cynically been described as a nonexistent 39 or as a vague endorsement of a popular idea 40 the goal here is neither to join the debate with my view of the proper definition of democracy nor to engage in a discussion of the various forms of government in which democracy is manifest 41 rather it is to articulate the democracy most capable of facilitation by the internet and most capable of facilitation or hindrance by iigs we are living in an information age 42 where access to information and participation in the circulation of information is a distinguishing feature of our world 43 it is an era represented by a shift from the manufacturing jobs typical of an industrial society to a world in which jobs are increasingly devoted to the creation handling or circulation of information in this networked society information flows dominate and shape our ways of life because of the speed and distance that information circulates 44 and our dependence on the production and distribution of information as a key source of wealth 45 in this information society the internet has emerged as a key tool for the creation and circulation of information but more broadly it has developed into an important mechanism for participation in democracy yochai benkler was correct in commenting that the early internet theorists beliefs that the internet is a democratising force was correct but imprecise 46 with the costs of entry low and the architecture decentralised 47 the internet invites mass participation at unprecedented levels in this sense it finds favour with ithiel de sola pool s seminal work technologies of freedom in which the author describes decentralisation of communication networks as the fostering of freedom 48 yet if the internet is to achieve its democratic potential it must tackle difficult problems of the digital divide that the division between the haves and have-nots of the information society concentration of the market fragmentation of discourse and of quality control 49 there are also problems such as the balkanisation of knowledge through the continual viewing of the same small group of websites 50 and the entrenchment of these websites at the top by the self-referencing of these sites in blogs twitter or on search engine results 51 however this does not mean that the internet does not have democratic potential but rather that it is more complex than was previously thought it means that how we think of notions of democracy the public sphere and information must be tweaked to better reflect the complex and swiftly evolving internet 52 under traditional conceptions of democracy there are three types that the internet might facilitate electoral monitorial and deliberative 53 electoral democracy is commonly known in the internet context as e-government the direct political communication between the state and its citizens for example countries are increasingly delivering public services and information to citizens directly through the internet by setting up websites to recruit volunteers and seek financial support for election campaigns 54 states are increasingly embracing the electronic casting of votes 55 in addition countries are exploring ways to facilitate citizen-to-government discourse such as the uk government s e-petition website to facilitate citizen petitions 56 monitorial democracy refers to the bottom-up grassroots activism that can be facilitated by the internet 57 these grassroots groups monitor political actions of governments and nongovernmental organisations ngos by using the internet to organise protests and disseminate information 58 deliberative democracy refers to participation by individuals in open debate in the belief that it will lead to better decisions on matters of common concern 59 it reflects the participative practice of democratic life 60 and was said to have originated in town halls and public squares and in pubs and coffee houses anywhere groups came together to exchange their views on issues of the day 61 most commonly it is framed as participation in the public sphere a term most notably used by jürgen habermas and discussed further later while the internet can certainly contribute to all of these facets of democracy its key contribution to democracy is as a facilitator of participation although participation is present in all three forms of democracy just identified it finds its home most closely in deliberative democracy this is because participation is experienced in cyberspace by communication or the lack thereof through chilling effects such as surveillance and hate crimes and deliberative democracy is at its core a communicative framework 62 however deliberative democracy does not quite capture the significance of participative practices on the internet either being altogether too narrow a concept for what i have been describing here this is an issue that will be explored in more detail shortly an examination of deliberative democracy is necessary however as it has a presence in the democracy promoted here in particular concerning the concept of the public sphere this book however will frame its definition of democracy in none of the three areas we have been discussing up to now but rather in the broader notion of democratic culture which better embodies the participative practices we have been discussing the deliberative democracy concept has two essential features for the purposes of analysis here both of which have different potentialities and drawbacks as embodying the democratic potential of the internet first at its core deliberative democracy is about valuing the rational and open exchange of opinions as the ideal way to reach understanding and agreement concerning common issues of concern one of its key theorists is jürgen habermas who takes a normative approach in which he idealises what he has described as the rational debates that took place within bourgeois society in the coffee houses of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries 63 he argues that legitimate decisions are only made when preceded by a period of rational discourse that satisfies certain rules 64 this is described as the ideal speech situation and requires for example that everyone who wishes to speak must have the opportunity to do so and that all speakers must be free from coercion 65 thus the communication sought in deliberative democracy is more than simple communication it requires that the interchange is reasoned and open and it pushes towards the goal of publicly acceptable decisions 66 as vincent price et al state w hat makes opinion deliberative is not merely that it has been built upon careful contemplation evidence and supportive arguments but also that it has grasped and taken into consideration the opposing view of others 67 there is a mythical tint to deliberative democracy a nostalgic idealisation of citizens meeting to exchange reasoned political thoughts 68 most internet-based discourse would fail to satisfy these rules 69 in a 2006 journal publication habermas made a passing remark on the applicability of his theory to the internet he commented that while the internet provides egalitarian opportunities for communication it fragments discourse and in a way that echoes the arguments of cass sunstein discussed in more detail later in the chapter said this the internet has certainly reactivated the grassroots of an egalitarian public of writers and readers however computer-mediated communication in the web can claim unequivocal democratic merits only for a special context it can undermine the censorship of authoritarian regimes that try to control and repress public opinion in the context of liberal regimes the rise of millions of fragmented chat rooms across the world tend instead to lead to the fragmentation of large but politically focused mass audiences into a huge number of isolated issue publics 70 most of the technologies discussed later in this chapter such as blogs social networking sites and message boards are not decision-making tools but are rather solely tools for discourse 71 and most of the social norms or terms of service that govern behaviour on such sites would fail habermas s rigid rules of discourse 72 deliberation also excludes many forms of communication that the internet is particularly good at facilitating such as poetry humour and satire such communications are meaningful to what i have been calling here democratic culture 73 the second element of deliberative democracy is the institutional arena 74 in which such rational communication takes place this is the concept of the public sphere for which there has been considerable discussion with regard to the internet s democratic potential 75 the internet might not necessarily facilitate the type of discourse deliberative democracy envisions but by offering spaces for such discourse it might be said to play in an institutional sense a democratising role granted rational communication might be a precondition to the public sphere but equally one first needs a space in which deliberative communication might take place 76 in this sense it might be better to describe the internet as creating a new public space as contended by zizi papacharissi one which does not yet constitute a public sphere 77 the public sphere as habermas describes it in the structural transformation of the public sphere 78 is a network for communicating information and points of view 79 it is a metaphorical space where individuals gather to participate in rational discourse on issues of the day through this role it is seen as a vehicle for societal integration 80 in modern society as social organisation took on a larger scale the mass media became viewed as the chief institutions of the public sphere 81 it became their role to express the varying viewpoints of the day and keep the public informed in habermas s view the modern public sphere has collapsed in comparison with this earlier period and he has sought to revive it by placing discourse firmly at its centre the internet might be an answer to habermas s call for a reinvigorated public sphere by as michael froomkin describes it draw ing power back into the public sphere 82 because it uniquely offers a participatory environment unavailable with traditional media it is a shift from the mass-media public sphere where relevance was decided by a select few constrained by space for newspapers and time radio and television and fed to the masses in a one-to-many structure to a many-to-many structure in which groups of individuals can simultaneously be contributors and consumers of their culture at the same time cultural technologies such as the telephone television and cinema have been multiplying and our identities increasingly come to be constructed by and expressed through what we consume 83 by opening up a discourse tool to mass participation it also has the potential to facilitate the creation of communities democracy is partly something experienced which is done through the social organisations that educate citizens on how to engage socially and politically 84 before the internet full democratic participation was hamstrung by the sheer inability of bringing together numerous people in one place for rational discussion 85 with the removal of spatial and temporal bounds and the freedom to participate anonymously or pseudonymously the internet facilitates town-hall-type gatherings and the creation of communities that might not have otherwise formed although internet communities are hard-pressed to compete with the strength of a real-world community this may change as the younger digital generation ages the internet can be a way to create a community despite distance and borders 86 we must be mindful not to stretch habermas s theory of the public sphere too far in a 2010 interview habermas opined that the internet is not in itself a public sphere he describes the internet as a centrifugal force for disparate communications and discussion but one which can not on its own produce any public spheres 87 but the web itself does not produce any public spheres its structure is not suited to focusing the attention of a dispersed public of citizens who form opinions simultaneously on the same topics and contributions which have been scrutinised and filtered by experts 88 however much the internet might reinvigorate the public sphere by activating public participation it is difficult to argue that the internet itself qualifies as a public sphere increased access to information does not automatically translate into a more informed or participatory citizenry the internet it is argued is best viewed not as one public sphere but as multiple spaces some public some private with multiple public spheres akin to peter dahlgren s description of the public sphere as a constellation of communicative spaces 89 the internet s distributive architecture prevents centralised control over communication and in so doing decenters the public sphere 90 in this way it fits with habermas s modified public sphere model which focuses more on thematic spheres and communication networks the public sphere can best be described as a network for communicating information and points of view i.e opinion expressing affirmative or negative attitudes the streams of communications are in the process filtered and synthesized in such a way that they coalesce into bundles of topically specific public domains 91 structurally new types of public spheres are emerging such as e-governments advocacy domains cultural and social domains and the journalism domain 92 rather than compare the public sphere to habermas s utopian model perhaps it should be compared to the media public sphere in such a comparison internet users are not passive consumers of information picked crafted and presented by the mass media but instead have the opportunity to be empowered participants in their democratic life anyone can be a publisher and anyone can access an abundance of information and ideas unavailable in the tailored mass-media environment 93 conceiving of the internet in this way embodies the broader definition of democratic culture promoted here this participative environment also helps transform traditional notions of democracy into a network model where power and participation are decentred and experienced across various sectors such as social political and civil society networks 94 this also mimics the shift seen on a global scale and in other fields such as financial regulation and commerce from more structured forms of regulation to decentred models of governance discussed more in chapter 3 mobile access to the internet for example has linked cyberspace with the physical world in a way that fuses these two worlds and facilitates action-oriented public spheres as seen with the arab spring demonstrations 95 the kernel of deliberative democracy is its emphasis on the participative part of democratic life and most particularly participation in the public sphere jack balkin argues that the internet has changed the social conditions of speech such that its central purpose is the promotion of what he terms democratic culture 96 democratic culture refers to the following it is more than representative institutions of democracy and it is more than deliberation about public issues rather a democratic culture is a culture in which individuals have a fair opportunity to participate in the forms of meaning making that constitute them as individuals democratic culture is about individual liberty as well as collective self-governance it is about each individual s ability to participate in the production and distribution of culture 97 this approach to democracy is framed in terms of democratic participation rather than democratic governance meaning that it is a form of social life that underlies culture and exists beyond the confines of representative democracy it focuses more broadly on culture on the forms of meaning-making in society because it includes within its ambit nonpolitical expression popular culture and individual participation it is democratic because anyone can participate regardless of race age political ties or economic status this participation is of value because it creates meaning for culture promotes a sense of self and encourages active engagement in the world 98 thus in this book when it is said that the internet is a democratising force the substance of what is being asserted is that the internet can help facilitate deliberation and participation in the forms of meaning-making in democratic society balkan s theory finds its roots in semiotic democracy a term coined by john fiske with regard to television to describe active public participation in creating and circulating meaning and pleasure 99 although television is a one-to-many medium its viewers are on equal footing with the producers and are invited to ascribe meaning to what is seen the viewer in effect becomes part of the discursive practice by taking pleasure in making meanings and participating in the creation of social identities 100 using this theory balkin asserts that the internet has changed the social conditions of speech bringing to the forefront previously less important features of speech and necessitating a revisiting of free speech theory 101 the internet he concludes accentuates the cultural and participatory features of freedom of expression 102 freedom of expression like the internet s topology can be described as an interconnected network a system of cultural and political interactions experienced at both individual and collective levels 103 information and communication technologies icts largely owned by private companies allow for participation in such interactions in a way previously unimagined it is also appropriative in the sense that participants can borrow from manipulate build on or simply co-opt existing cultural resources 104 this interaction expands what is meant by democracy beyond the political to the cultural what democratic culture does is broaden our conception of what it means for the internet to have democratic potential and it recognises that democracy is as much something experienced as it is a political structure it is a way of life inextricably tied up with community and culture democratic culture also recognises the importance of freedom of expression to democracy and to human rights democracy has always been embodied in the practices of communication 105 and freedom of expression has consistently been identified by the courts as central to democracy in lingens v. austria the european court of human rights ecthr famously commented that freedom of expression is one of the essential foundations of a democratic society 106 habermas s theories concerning deliberative democracy can not be applied seamlessly to the internet environment however his work tying together democracy and human rights by identifying the link as communication is persuasive 107 human rights he articulates is the enabling condition the language for legitimate and democratic decision making he summarises the internal connection between popular sovereignty and human rights that we are looking for consists in the fact that human rights state precisely the conditions under which the various forms of communication necessary for politically autonomous law-making can be legally institutionalised 108 freedom of expression and access to a wide range of information sources has been described as the lifeblood of democracy 109 in an information society the importance of communication rights as a type of human right is accentuated because of the central role played by information in wealth and development 110 i n the deliberative process information plays a central role along with achieving equality of access to it equality of access to information and an unrestricted means of access are fundamental to a more ambitious practice of discourse 111 this right is more comprehensive than is often understood most human rights instruments explicitly or implicitly include the right to receive information in the right to freedom of expression this can be clearly seen in article 19 of the universal declaration of human rights udhr which states everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interferences and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers 112 similar language is used in the european convention on human rights echr 113 and german basic law 114 many states such as estonia finland france greece and spain have legislatively recognised internet access as a fundamental right 115 in 2003 the committee of ministers of the council of europe adopted a declaration affirming the importance of freedom of expression on the internet 116 since 2010 we have seen a paradigm shift at an international level in the recognition of human rights in cyberspace access to the internet as a fundamental right received the united nations un stamp of approval in a report by frank la rue the special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 117 in this report la rue not only recognised the importance of the internet to the exercise of free speech but acknowledged the critical role of companies as the gatekeepers to exercising it g iven that internet services are run and maintained by private companies the private sector has gained unprecedented influence over individuals right to freedom of expression and access to information 118 he concluded that state use of blocking technologies was often in violation of their obligation to guarantee the right to free speech and that such measures should never be delegated to private parties 119 this was followed up in 2012 by the un human rights council passing a resolution affirming internet freedom as a basic human right in particular the right to freedom of expression 120 recently in ahmet yildirim v. turkey 121 the ecthr held that blocking access to the entire sites.google.com platform breached the right to freedom of expression under article 10 of the echr this case discussed in further detail in chapter 4 concerned the order by the denizli criminal court to block access to a site that insulted the memory of ataturk which breaches turkish law due to purported technical reasons the entire platform was ordered by the court to be blocked rather than just the offending site ahmet yildirim an owner of one of the websites hosted by sites.google.com brought the case to the ecthr the court made several notable points concerning freedom of expression most relevant here the court confirmed that the right to free expression applies to access to the internet which includes a right of unhindered access to it 122 the court found that this right applies not only to the content of information but also to the means of dissemination 123 participation in communication – in discourse – is the core of the deliberative democracy framework but as has we have seen it falls short of being a democracy that the internet can facilitate because of the rigidity of the types of discourse that qualify as deliberation and the expectation that such deliberation will lead to legitimate public decisions instead we should understand the internet as being multiple spaces some of which are less-idealised public spheres in this way the internet s potential as a force within democratic culture reveals itself such spaces although they might not show such extensive deliberation and risk being in form a thin democracy 124 can be seen as tentative forms of self-determination and control from below 125 these are new forms of public spheres because the very act of visiting the spaces and engaging in discussions is a movement towards participation in democratic life which has been waning in this sense they enhance community and culture as well both of which are as we have seen critical to the broader definition of democratic culture embraced here this section examines more closely the ways that the internet facilitates participation in democratic culture the goal is to relate this to the focus of the book on iigs and their power to facilitate or hinder the internet s democratic potential viewed from the perspective of democratic culture two forms of participation emerge as important to democracy information access and political and cultural participation protection and facilitation of these participations is key to moving forward with a democratic vision of the internet as regards information access the reader will note our growing reliance on privately owned information guidance instruments to organise the overwhelming amount of information on the internet with increasing participation online in politics and culture discourse also takes place in spaces and using technologies that are privately owned with such owners setting the terms of use and deciding what information is censored blocking access to information through the use of filtering technologies and control of information guidance mechanisms comprise the case studies in chapters 4 and 5 we are increasingly dependent on the internet in the functioning of our daily lives 126 we use the internet to socialise with friends and family research professional and personal issues pay bills create works of art and purchase consumer goods and services the importance of the internet to the information society is reflected in the rapid increase in internet access and the importance people assign to having this access in 2013 86 per cent of adults and 99 per cent of sixteen- to twenty-four-year-olds in the united kingdom had used the internet whereas 83 per cent of households had internet access 127 this is an increase of 22 per cent since 2007 and an increase of 58 per cent since 2002 128 at the same time use of mobile phones to access the internet doubled between 2010 and 2013 from 24 per cent to 53 per cent and online shopping increased from 53 per cent to 72 per cent of adults between 2008 and 2013 129 in the united states the internet penetration rate is 86 per cent for adults up from 14 per cent in 1995 130 this infiltration of the internet into our daily lives reflects the increased importance of information to the functioning of society which forms the communicative link between habermas and democratic culture set out earlier the internet s importance to political participation and more broadly its importance to the circulation of information as valuable in itself can be seen in numerous examples around the world 131 in the united states sites such as www.moveon.org www.techpresident.com and www.dailykos.com have become increasingly popular resources 132 moveon.org for example claims to have more than 8 million members in president barak obama s first presidential race he launched an aggressive internet campaign using his social networking site http //my.barackobama.com to engage with and inform supporters and volunteers just a few years later the use of social media and new media became a basic component of successful political campaigns in his 2012 re-election campaign president obama launched mybo which integrated with facebook to allow facebook users and communities to interact with the campaign 133 as rob salkowitz comments t hese erstwhile novelties are now the minimum price of admission for a modern campaign 134 the participative practices online also allow stories that may have gone unnoticed by traditional media to go viral and spread globally in the blink of an eye this happened during president obama s run for the democratic nomination in 2008 at a fundraiser in san francisco in april 2008 obama remarked unwisely that small-town pennsylvanian voters are bitter one of the attendees blogged about the comment on the popular huffington post website the story was then picked up by the mainstream media – media it should be emphasised which was not permitted to attend the event 135 where the technology of the internet is particularly facilitative is as a platform for mobilising social and political change popular sites such as change.org have supported campaigns to for example keep a female historical figure on a british banknote 136 this campaign also reveals the dark underbelly of online participation as the campaigner caroline criado-perez was subject to abuse on twitter including threats of violence and rape two of the abusers pleaded guilty in 2014 to sending menacing messages 137 two further events are particularly relevant here the occupy movement in 2011 and 2012 for social and economic change we are the 99 spanned more than 700 locations worldwide 138 social media was the organising tool for protests and other events linking the individuals participating in the demonstrations and providing unified communication on platforms such as twitter the strength of internet communications here arguably was the ability to communicate in real time what some researchers have called serendipitous 139 events such as the pepper spraying of seated student protesters at university of california davis similarly the debates in the united states concerning the controversial stop online privacy act sopa and the protect ip act pipa were mobilised largely through internet communications a post on reddit for example suggesting a boycott of internet registration provider godaddy for its support of sopa/pipa mobilised several users to transfer to a different registrar and even more to threaten to do so godaddy quickly backed down and withdrew its support of the legislation 140 researchers mapped the sopa/pipa debates and found that they drew participants across a variety of sectors from smaller technology companies to ngos to individuals and traditional media where high-traffic sites could act as an attention backbone to give visibility to websites with less traffic 141 their conclusion was optimistic as to the potential of a networked public sphere during this controversy several major technology companies including wikipedia and google staged a blackout of their sites in protest against the proposed legislation this highlights a more subtle difficulty with the role of these companies and their impact on human rights such as free speech because we expect and depend on them to be our advocates more dramatic examples of the power of social media are to be found in the coverage of the arab spring demonstrations everyone remembers the face of the iranian protests of 2009 a young woman named neda agha-soltan whose death was seen as a rallying cry for the protesters 142 grainy shaky cell phone video footage of her being shot and killed by militia men during a protest was taken and distributed online anonymously the video was later awarded a george polk prize for journalism the first time such an award was made for anonymous work 143 such examples show as colin maclay describes it the power of new technologies to support human rights 144 this interactivity and access to information empowers users arguably reinvigorating the public sphere 145 the more recent arab spring however demonstrates both the power of social media as a tool for democracy and the power of the gatekeepers whether state or private 146 to shut down these avenues of discourse protesters across the middle east communicated with each other using a variety of social media platforms such as facebook twitter and youtube to spread information and further mobilise protesters egypt responded by first blocking access to social media sites and then shutting down internet connectivity entirely as well as blocking mobile networks 147 google and twitter then created a speak to tweet tool that enabled twitter users to post tweets by leaving voice messages which the tool then turned into tweets 148 as we can see there are various dimensions to online engagement with democratic culture two types of participation stand out as particularly facilitative of democratic culture social/political and appropriative 149 much of the earlier examples have focused on social networking twitter has been the most surprising tool in facilitating participation in democratic culture what started out as a platform for celebrities and narcissists to voice the most mundane minutiae of their everyday lives has rapidly become an important tool for spreading information twitter consolidates tweets through trending in which the most popular topics at any given moment twitter trends are listed in a sidebar on the right side of the webpage 150 the occupy movement for example used the hashtag occupy following a murder rampage in california prompted by hatred of women internet conversations on the subject were linked with the hashtag yesallwomen in so doing twitter is not only a tool for discourse but it also shapes democratic culture by acting as an information manager guiding us through twitterverse and thereby cyberspace beyond similarly a site such as facebook has 1.23 billion monthly active users 151 and while it might appear to only be of use for gossip and keeping in touch with friends it is increasingly being used for professional networking political activism and educational purposes 152 for example the internet governance forum has a facebook group 153 the european union has a space called eu tube for free speech and open debate 154 many ngos have groups on facebook such as the institute for human rights and business most of the interactions discussed in this chapter fall short of the demands of deliberative democracy however in a democratic culture the focus is less on participation in the idealised town hall and more on valuing the very act of engaging in such a dialectical free-for-all 155 this is written conscious that there are limits to the value of such a discursive free-for-all these spaces and the anonymity and pseudonymity they often allow have fuelled cybermobs and given voice to discriminatory and threatening speech 156 the internet also facilitates what was described earlier as the appropriative aspect of democratic culture because internet users can take part in culture by producing it and modifying it themselves 157 whereas under a deliberative democracy framework such activities would be dismissed as purely entertainment under democratic culture such activities play a more central role for example we all remember the spate of memes parodying a pinnacle scene in the movie der untergang downfall depicting adolf hitler ranting during one of his final days in the berlin bunker voice-over parodies ranged from hitler ranting about hillary clinton losing the democratic party candidacy for president to hitler trying to find wally to hitler commenting on the subprime mortgage crisis 158 there was even a parody of the removal of the parodies from youtube for claims of breach of copyright 159 in addition humanitarian organisations are increasingly using the internet to persuade and educate the public about issues for example mtvu in partnership with the reebok human rights foundation and the international crisis group created an online game called darfur is dying to highlight the atrocities in the sudan and educate users on ways to help 160 the promise of the internet as a tool in furthering a democratic culture is presented here with much fanfare this is done on purpose to tease out for the reader what is at stake there is incredible discursive promise to the spaces and technologies made possible by the internet environment and one commonality threads its way through this discussion the capacity of private companies to gatekeep the flow of information whether as innovators facilitators or censors they own the spaces and technologies of discourse the implications of which are the focus of the case studies in chapters 4 and 5 section 1.3.2 addresses the main concerns put forward by sceptics of the internet s democratic potential highlighting further the power of the internet to be a force for good and bad and the critical role that these private gatekeepers inevitably play the expansion in the range of discourses that further democracy risks pushing the idea of democratic culture too far to a point at which any communication can be dressed up as important to democratic culture and therefore worthy of protection two things must be clarified first while democratic culture is a more inclusive notion than deliberative democracy it is not without limits and what is proposed here is not a form of cyberutopianism criticised by authors such as evgeny morozov 161 these issues can often be politicised unnecessarily distorting the debate and preventing a nuanced discussion of the policy framework legal and otherwise that will best move us forward as rick lambers notes s uch political polarisation may leave little room for legal subtleties 162 second the limits are less about what is said in this space and more about the infrastructure that makes the communication possible about freedom of expression in practice in looking at how private companies can facilitate or hinder participation in democratic culture i am examining the administrative structure of freedom of expression part of the concern in an environment of endless information and communities for participation is that users go online for the reinforcement effect of being political if they are political or disengaged if they are disengaged and most often just to be entertained 163 such a concern can be partly dismissed as simply reflective of the realities of democratic life in the physical world transposed online however the argument becomes more powerful when pushed further to a concern that the internet fragments discourse and attention 164 one of the leading scholars expressing this view regarding the internet is cass sunstein in republic.com sunstein describes this fragmentation as the daily me a term earlier coined by nicholas negroponte 165 in which people choose to filter the information that they read see and hear to their interests thus avoiding ever being exposed to for example international news or sports but having a steady stream of celebrity gossip and fashion news liberals conservatives or neo-nazis seek out websites forums or blogs with like-minded people who reinforce their views of the world in this way discourse and community are fragmented and we suffer a loss online media is therefore distinct from traditional media if one flips on the television news one is forced to view whatever news stories the mass media chooses to run thus exposing oneself to opposing points of view and thereby gaining a fuller perspective in his updated book republic.com 2.0 sunstein emphasises at the outset that freedom of expression is not simply freedom from censorship but that it requires affirmative steps as well it must challenge people by exposing them to opposing points of view 166 this is lost by the daily me of internet fragmentation the fundamental concern of this book is to see how unlimited consumer options might compromise the preconditions of a system of freedom of expression which include unchosen exposures and shared experiences to understand the nature of this concern we will make the most progress if we insist that the free-speech principle should be read in light of the commitment to democratic deliberation in other words a central point of the free-speech principle is to carry out that commitment 167 sunstein s concern regarding fragmentation is not the death knell to the internet s force as part of democratic culture rather it is the narrower concept of deliberative democracy with which he is concerned and which is undermined by this fragmentation of discourse examination of how to guard against fragmentation is an important examination but fragmentation is not as polarising as sunstein fears 168 first sunstein s criticism here is essentially of the choices people make when they go online furthermore fragmentation already occurs in the physical world by the very existence and mushrooming of advocacy groups and other issue-oriented organisations in addition a certain amount of fragmentation is part of being a member of a group where the group might first flesh out its membership views and bonds internally before entering the fray of the public sphere 169 of concern in cyberspace is whether such groups do more than associate internally but cyberspace has also created the ability for many groups to form at all thus bridging previously insurmountable spatial and temporal boundaries and often through anonymity and pseudonymity facilitating membership of the otherwise reclusive and shy the internet has also been criticised on a different basis by authors such as andrew keen 170 for creating a cult of amateurs which has caused the demise of traditional media and ultimately harmed society keen s concern is that traditional media are being replaced by personal media 171 and as a result we increasingly rely on unreliable amateur non-vetted posts on for example wikipedia digg youtube or twitter for our news and education in turn traditional media are floundering with profits plummeting as fewer buy newspapers and classified advertisements are alternatively posted for free online at such websites as craigslist 172 he cautions that traditional media are facing extinction and with them today s experts and cultural gatekeepers – our reporters news anchors editors music companies and hollywood studios 173 the overriding concern arising from this cult of amateurs is who will play the watchdog role 174 the internet is not replacing traditional media but is instead another tool for participation in democratic culture in terms of political participation a study of the 2006 american midterm elections found that television was still the main source of political news at 69 per cent of respondents trailed by newspapers at 34 per cent and the internet at 15 per cent 175 researchers found that use of the internet for political news doubled since the 2002 election whereas use of television and newspapers remained static 176 this indicates that use of one is not replacing the other they are being used in combination there is no doubt however that traditional media are facing a period of challenge and decline 177 this is despite the fact that the media have a strong presence online and are arguably a core part of the internet s public sphere 178 charlie beckett describes it as a shift from a manufacturing industry to a service economy in which i t is a change in practice from providing a product to acting as facilitators and connectors it means an end to duplication and a focus on what value every bit of journalism production adds 179 some therefore argue that traditional media are simply in the midst of a revolution 180 furthermore as the public becomes more mistrustful of traditional media and questions whether the fourth estate is in fact fulfilling its watchdog obligations citizen journalists emerge as both partners with the media such as the blogger about barack obama s comment on pennsylvanian voters and watchdogs of the media while it is true that citizen journalists can not investigate issues as thoroughly as can paid reporters with the backing of a commercial media company on the other hand they are not beholden to corporate interests and therefore are not influenced by corporate advertisers or the risks of litigation 181 what is important in terms of the internet s potential in democratic culture is that citizens can participate in the discussion the news becomes interactive the opportunities for participation in democratic culture opened up by the internet have also reinforced our dependence on private companies for its effective use with the influx of information that the internet has empowered comes the issue of information overload also known as the babel objection 182 a user is confronted with an endless array of information without the vetting of a professional media organisation as to its quality and reliability it becomes the task of modern internet users to sort through large amounts of information and determine what is relevant and reliable and as we move towards a semantic web it has become the task of innovators to create more tools for information management 183 information management technologies have emerged to help guide the user through the clutter for example without a search engine a user must know the url uniform resource locator or webpage address for a piece of information or a website of interest as a result most users rely on search engines such as google or yahoo to organise the information on the internet for them 184 other more subtle information guidance instruments play a similar role google news selects and categories news stories apple controls the apps available on its devices 185 these innovations are critical to users having a meaningful experience of the internet and to facilitating the internet as a force within democratic culture are we doomed to the same websites same information and same self-reinforcing views some might find comfort in the internet s use as such but this is not fatal to the internet s democratic potential rather as benkler states the internet structures a networked public sphere more attractive than the mass-media-dominated public sphere 186 as the internet begins to permeate every aspect of our lives it increasingly begins to reflect the real world it increasingly becomes part of the real world this is not an invasion of cyberspace that nullifies the internet s democratic potential which some have argued 187 instead it ushers in the same complexities and variables of the real world not everyone watches the news nor will everyone seek news online however the internet does offer new tools for participating in such discussions for those interested and an abundance of resources for any individual who might have a specific issue of interest the hope is that digital technologies will eventually increase concern and participation in politics and culture the internet has the potential to facilitate participation in democratic culture by inviting widespread involvement of internet users in creating and defining the things that mean something in our democratic society through the increasingly interactive nature of the online experience and the endless spaces available for the creation of communities users are able to seek out and circulate information and ideas and build on modify and comment on their culture this communicative process enabled by technology is what makes democratic culture the type of democracy for which the internet is most facilitative the thread running through this chapter is the critical role that freedom of expression plays in furthering participation in democratic culture online and the therefore central role that information gatekeepers play in facilitating or hindering this expression if the internet has the potential to be a democratising force the other side of the coin is that it can be used as a tool to limit participation which threatens to draw the internet away from its democratic potential the technology itself is neutral and its use for democratic or undemocratic purposes depends on those who control it since in western democracies privately owned companies for the most part own the technologies that control the pathways of communication they become the focal point for the realisation of the internet s democratic potential this means focusing on the governance structure of the gatekeepers this book will show that the corporate governance frameworks that currently govern many of their activities are insufficient to facilitate this potential and instead hamper the ability of the internet to work as a tool for democracy the next chapter examines what is meant by the term gatekeeper and will define for reader the term internet information gatekeeper discussed here proposing a human rights-driven framework for their identification 1 see l. winner do artifacts have politics in d. mackenzie and j. wajcman eds the social shaping of technology 2 nd edn buckingham open
