losing streak to its in-state rival since the 1920s and many fans will regard the season as a failure after the team couldn t find a way to win one of its final two games necessary to find a way to make the postseason simply put vol nation expects a win over vanderbilt every season regardless of the circumstances around the game and that s just the way it s always going to be for most tennessee fans at the very least pruitt seems to have an understanding of that fact despite this being his first year on the job in knoxville this is probably the first time in a long time for me that early on in the season we weren t participating or playing for playoff implications or a championship in the league pruitt said on monday i said before this game means a whole lot to a whole lot of people and probably since the florida loss or the georgia loss we ve been playing for pride to me you can talk about winning a championship or whatever but pride is about as important as it gets not only do the first-year tennessee coaches understand and appreciate the importance of the vanderbilt game and what it means according to pruitt he also senses his players grasp the gravity of this game i think it s important for our players pruitt continued it s going to be important for our senior class to end with a win against vanderbilt i think it s important for everyone associated with our program to raise our level of play we ve had opportunities to do that a couple of times this year and in my opinion have not necessarily played at our best that s on us as coaches to get everybody in our program to be at their best that s on us as coaches to get everybody in our program to be at their best it s a great opportunity for us it s a chance to possibly have a winning record and anytime you have positive things going on i think it s going to help you in recruiting those sentiments were followed up by his players during their monday media availability it is important that we go to a bowl game this year but we have to focus on this game first and that is where it starts baylen buchanan said on monday i know it means a lot for the people of knoxville vol nation the coaches and our team that we win this game this week like i said i haven t beaten them so it means a lot for us to win this week. his fellow defensive back todd kelly echoed those sentiments early in the week i think it s important in my case it s my last game of the season and we can extend our season a little bit longer if we make a bowl game vanderbilt just won this past game so they re in the same position it s a win or go home mentality for both teams so i think with that being said we re going to go into this game enthusiastic and excited that we have another opportunity to play on a saturday we also have to realize that it s a win or go home mentality you have to win this ball game in order to extend our season. both programs enter the game at 5-6 one game from ending the season with a .500 record the tennessee-vanderbilt game kicks off at 4 p.m et 3 p.m. ct on saturday and will air on the sec network you must be logged in to post a comment please sign in or register come on boys it s time to flush the commodes go vols difference could come down to qb play and right now i would take shurmur vandy can t stop the run so if ut can run the ball effectively then vols will win but ke shawn vaughn is one of the beat in the league and he could have a big game as well ut had an outstanding 20 yards against charlotte .just replicate what mizzou did and bama did and georgia did and not what auburn did troll on leg humper there aren t a lot of 5-6 matchups that excite me but this one does this will be a fun game to watch as the stakes and emotions will be quite high tennessee has never fallen so low before last year when people actually predict vandy to beat us that is more proof and it is humiliating that should be all our players need if they have any fire in their belly go vols
