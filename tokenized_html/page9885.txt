me as i was going through the interview that we as were talking about the culture that i operate in and that i want to have the program emulate they were saying the exact same thing it was really in concert and the more i was there i could see that it was a good fit for me and i was hoping it would be for them. he told his illinois team monday morning it s hard i ve known all these kids since they were freshmen in high school hambly said the kids i committed to be here for that s gutting i love them i truly love them like they were my own daughters it s going to be hard to see them from afar and if we were to play them that would be really difficult i ll always feel like an illini i feel like i grew up here as a coach and as a man really i came in as a 30-year-old and i ve been here 13 years and feel like i ve grown up it s been a really cool place to grow up in with amazing people. hambly had high praise for new illinois athletic director josh whitman and is optimistic for the future for his old program it s a much better job than when i found it and i m really proud of that hambly said i m really proud of what i did while i was here what we accomplished and not just wins and losses you always want to win more — i d take one more win in 2011 — but how we operated and the class that the program exuded the entire time is what i m most proud about it should be a job that

bernard muir said in a news release kevin is not only a great coach and teacher of the game but he possesses the same values that make stanford special with a strong core returning from the national championship team i have no doubt that kevin will keep our women s volleyball team among the nation s elite i believe he will maintain the integrity and sportsmanship this program is built on while ensuring our student-athletes reach their full potential on the court in the classroom and beyond the farm. hambly is a former president of the avca and worked extensively with the usa national team in various capacities stanford s existing staff includes longtime associate head coach denise corlett who has been with the cardinal for 27 years cassidy lichtman a former stanford player joined the staff last season i need time to talk to people and figure out what it s all about hambly said right now i m not sure. interestingly he leaves behind a staff that includes jason mansfield who joined hambly last spring at illinois after 14 years on staff at stanford stanford which finished 27-7 last season 15-5 in the pac-12 where it tied for second with ucla behind washington won its last 10 matches six in the ncaa tournament the cardinal beat texas in the ncaa title match with a roster led by senior middle inky ajanaku the volleyballmag.com player of the year but also four starting freshmen outside kathryn plummer middle audriana fitzmorris setter jenna gray and libero morgan hentz i m very excited to see what the future holds because we ve only heard great things about him so far said hentz who added that the cardinal team was told of hambly s hire monday morning obviously we re going to miss john but we re really excited what s more it s assumed that the 2015 national freshman of the year hayley hodson will return to the cardinal in 2017 after sustaining an injury and leaving school early last season it s a great team to inherit with high expectations and it s a different thing to manage than they had to manage last year hambly said so to navigate that is going to be a fun problem to solve together and see how that works but certainly the talent is there to do some incredible things the next several years and that s exciting but honestly that was exciting but that wasn t the main reason i wanted to take the program i would have taken it if it was a down year it s an amazing place and bernard is a really special athletic director as is beth goode senior women s administrator they re just special people the minute we were there hambly s wife the former mary coleman is from the chicago area and not only played at illinois 1995-98 but was also an assistant coach 2004-06 they met in 2001 and went to illinois together they have two daughters quinn and maura once she saw palo alto and what it and we looked into the schools and all that she was pretty excited to get our family out there hambly said whitman had nothing but praise for his outgoing coach kevin hambly has done an outstanding job leading our volleyball program to a position of national prominence during his eight years at the helm whitman said in an illinois news release he approached every day with passion pride and great integrity his student-athletes performed as champions on the court in the classroom and in their respective lives we will miss kevin mary and their daughters in our program and our community and we wish them the best as they return to kevin s native california here we look forward to identifying the next dynamic leader who will continue the program on its upward trajectory we are excited to usher in a new championship era of illinois volleyball. save my name email and website in this browser for the next time i comment read the articles
