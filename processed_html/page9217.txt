Native Javascript get browser width after resize, then run a function - Stack Overflow                     By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our  Cookie Policy ,  Privacy Policy , and our  Terms of Service .                 This question already has an answer here: I have this program I am building, where the content loads based on the window width. On page load, it functions normally with the correct HTML and CSS attached. But when i resize the page, my ajax makes too many calls to load the appropriate sheets, causing the content to flicker annoyingly. There seems to be ten thousand answers for JQuery, but none for native Javascript. I have deducted, from many of these questions and answers on SO, that a timeout is needed to get one value on the COMPLETION of the resize function. but.. to no avail. even with the timeout, it still makes rapid calls to AJAX. This is what i have worked out so far. This works fine on page load. The correct scripts fall into place. But when i resize the browser, in console.log, it makes an abundance of calls, making the page flicker drastically. As per the JQuery solutions, i tried several ways to get ONE value from  window.onresize . STILL i could not get a single value, but persistent calls. What i have tried, from what i read, was to comment out   window.onresize = layoutHandler;  and move  layoutHandler();  to the bottom of the BODY. Then tried this... Even with the timeout, it still reacts to every pixel increase with a call to the function. Except for the page flickering with all the calls, this works perfect. If i could get a SINGLE value, AFTER the resize event, my issue would be solved. Looking for a Native Javascript solution / suggestion.  TY in advance.
