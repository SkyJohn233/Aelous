and associated chronic inflammation the aim of this study was to investigate peripheral blood levels of soluble il1 receptor accessory protein sil1rap a potent natural inhibitor of il1 in women with and without endometriosis peripheral blood samples were collected from women with endometriosis n 47 consulting for infertility pelvic pain or tubal ligation in whom the disease was diagnosed at laparoscopy control healthy women n 27 were requesting tubal ligation or reanastomosis and had no visible evidence of endometriosis at laparoscopy sil1rap levels were determined by elisa whereas estradiol e2 and progesterone p4 levels were determined by competitive immunoassays sil1rap levels were significantly decreased in women with early endometriosis stages compared to controls p x0003c 0.05 and markedly during the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle p x0003c 0.001 actually while sil1rap were significantly increased in the proliferative compared to the secretory phase in normal women p x0003c 0.0001 and peaked at the end of this phase sil1rap remained consistently low and showed non-significant variations throughout the menstrual cycle in women with endometriosis lower circulating levels of sil1rap points to a significant impairment in the counter-regulatory mechanisms of il1 which in view of the cytokine x02019 s potent inflammatory and growth-promoting properties may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of endometriosis endometriosis is one of the most frequent gynaecological diseases in reproductive age women a one in ten woman suffers from endometriosis in north america defined as an ectopic growth of endometrial tissue endometriosis is frequently associated pelvic pain and infertility 30-40 1 and a chronic pelvic inflammation 2 cumulative evidence clearly points to a significant role for immune factors in endometriosis development inflammation is a major hallmark of endometriosis but the underlying mechanisms are not clearly elucidated local immune surveillance appears to be deficient in women with endometriosis and immune cells seem to paradoxically favor ectopic endometrial cell growth via different mechanisms that include secretion of inflammatory angiogenic and growth mediators such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 mcp1 macrophage migration inhibitory factor mif interleukin 1 il1 il8 and vascular endothelial cell growth factor vegf 3 these contribute to endometriosis-associated chronic peritoneal inflammation but also to endometrial cell survival attachment to the peritoneal tissue invasion proliferation and activation of the host angiogenic responses 3 endometriotic implants are likely to stimulate leukocyte recruitment and activation and endometrial dysfunctions may contribute to the activation of peritoneal immune cells and exacerbate the inflammatory reaction via cyclical reflux of menstrual debris into the peritoneal cavity 3 7 nevertheless alterations in immune functions observed in patients having endometriosis are not restricted to the peritoneal cavity where the disease is frequently found systemic alterations including increased levels of cytokines 8 reduced cytotoxic effects of lymphocytes on autologous endometrial cells and increased activation of peripheral blood monocytes 9 10 were reported these cells also appeared to stimulate endometrial cell growth in vitro 9 11 our and other previous studies found reduced concentrations of sil1r2 in the peripheral blood of women with endometriosis 12 13 this decoy receptor is a potent natural inhibitor of il1 14 which suggests an impairment in il1 surveillance and counter-regulatory mechanisms in women with endometriosis at the systemic level il1 activates cells via its receptor type 1 il1r1 and the involvement of membrane-bound receptor accessory protein mil1rap 15 however a soluble form of il1rap sil1rap which results from alternative splicing rather than form proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound receptor extracellular domain has been described sil1rap was detected in human serum and appeared to play an important role in the counter-regulation of il1 effects by increasing the affinity of il1 binding to sil1r2 16 our subsequent studies showed that sil1rap levels were significantly decreased in the endometrium and peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis 17 18 the aim of this study was then to evaluate sil1rap concentrations in sera of endometriosis patients and investigate the influence of endometriosis stage and main symptoms pain and infertility and the menstrual cycle phase

ng/ml and showing a sensitivity limit of approximately 0.4 x000a0 ng/ml measurements were performed in duplicate all samples were assessed at the same time to prevent any possible changes due to freezing and thawing the inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation for the sil1rap assay were 5.8 and 8.0 respectively serum e 2 and p4 were measured by competitive immunoassays based on antibody-coated tubes commercial kits coat-a-count diagnostic products corp. los angeles ca the intra-assay coefficients of variation measured at low medium and high levels of the standard curves were between 1.8 and 8.0 for all the immunoassays the inter-assay coefficients of variation were less than 8.0 for e 2 and 10 for p4 sil1rap concentrations followed a gaussian distribution and were statistically analysed using one-way analysis of variance anova and the bonferroni x02019 s test for post hoc for multiple comparisons comparison of 2 groups was performed using the unpaired t test

patients in the present study we found that sil1rap levels were not significantly altered in the peripheral blood of women with endometriosis only a slight diminution was observed compared to normal women our data did not point to any noticeable relationship with endometriosis-related infertility or pelvic pain as sil1rap levels were comparable in fertile and infertile women with endometriosis and in those who have or not pelvic pain however data analysis according to endometriosis stage revealed a statistically significant decrease in the earliest stages of the disease the number of eiii/iv patients included in this study was too small to draw a definite conclusion on sil1rap relationship with advanced endometriosis stages nevertheless our findings are consistent with the available literature showing that endometriosis is biochemically more active in the early stages actually it is quite believed that endometriotic lesion types represent distinctive steps in the evolutionary process of the disease and that initial and highly active vascularized and inflammatory red lesions display an increased expression of pro-inflammatory angiogenic and tissue remodelling factors such as nuclear factor nf -kb il1r1 mif vascular endothelial cell growth factor vegf and prostaglandins pgs 21 25 analysis of sil1rap concentrations according to the menstrual cycle further revealed a significant decrease during the proliferative phase in women with endometriosis compared to controls and precisely at the end of this phase a phenomenon that was not observed during the secretory phase actually sil1rap levels were significantly lower in the proliferative than in the secretory phase in normal healthy controls whereas in women with endometriosis they showed no significant cycle-dependent variations and remained low throughout the menstrual cycle analysis of e 2 and p4 levels in the peripheral blood sera of the same women did not reveal any significant endometriosis-related changes nor did it identify a significant correlation with sil1rap levels which rules out their involvement in the regulation of sil1rap levels in the peripheral blood the decrease in circulating sil1rap levels remains unexplained and so are the source s of sil1rap secretion sil1rap was detected in human serum 16 but it is unknown whether immune blood cells the predominant cell population in the peripheral blood could be responsible for sil1rap production furthermore immune cell dysfunctions have been described in sera of patients with endometriosis and could explain this phenomenon 3 7 9 26 27 however we can not completely rule out an eventual endometrial origin since our previous study showed that human endometrium is capable of producing sil1rap 18 considering that the endometrium is a highly vascularized tissue a decrease in the secretion of endometrial sil1r3 could at least partly explain our current results it would however be interesting to evaluate the production of sil1r3 in immune blood cells of women with and without endometriosis our findings may have a significant relevance for endometriosis pathophysiology actually sil1rap is a major specific inhibitor of il1 unlike the constitutive membrane-bound form of il1rap which is necessary for il1-mediatd cell activation via the functional activating il1r1 sil1rap potentiates il1 affinity for the decoy inhibitory il1r2 and plays thereby a significant role in the down-regulation of the cytokine x02019 s pro-inflammatory effects 14 16 28 il1 a and b forms were detected in the peripheral blood but their increased concentrations in women with endometriosis reported by some studies were not corroborated by other studies 12 13 29 however the significant decline in serum sil1rap levels in endometriosis stages i-ii shown in the current study together with the reduced concentration of sil1r2 shown by our and other previous studies particularly in stages i-ii as well 12 13 clearly point to a significant deficiency in the specific regulatory mechanisms of il1 at the systemic level in the earliest stages of the disease endometriosis-associated immune and inflammatory changes were mainly located within the peritoneal cavity of endometriosis patients where the disease frequently develops and especially within endometriotic lesions where immune cell infiltration and endometriotic cell activation and expression of inflammatory tissue remodelling and growth factors were reported 2 8 30 32 however although relatively less obvious intrauterine and even systemic immune-inflammatory changes such as increased activation of monocytes and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines have also been observed in women with endometriosis 3 7 9 26 27 sil1rap was found to be down-regulated in eutopic endometrial tissue of women with endometriosis and a significant decline in the concentration of this molecule was found in the peritoneal fluid as well 33 this considering the pro-inflammatory angiogenic and growth promoting properties of il1 14 34 36 and its increased production in endometriotic tissue 33 suggests that a combination of local and systemic deficiency in sil1rap may lead to an increased endometriotic cell activation by il1 and contribute to the promotion of the ectopic growth and development of these cells it is noteworthy that because of its potent anti-inflammatory properties il1racp has been shown to ameliorate collagen-induced arthritis in vivo using a collagen-induced-arthritis mouse model 28 37 in fact its ability to interact with il1 seems to play a substantial role in the regulation of inflammation since it has been approved for therapeutic use as an il1 trap fusion protein 38 therefore it would be of interest to evaluate sil1racp efficacy as a potential treatment of endometriosis using mouse models our study showed for the first time a cycle phase dependency for sil1rap levels in the peripheral blood of normal healthy women which peak in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle but instead showed non-significant variations throughout the menstrual of women with endometriosis lower circulating levels of sil1rap may in combination a deficiency in sil1rap expression in eutopic endometrium and a reduction in its peritoneal fluid concentrations be relevant to endometriosis pathophysiology as it points to a significant lack in the counter-regulatory mechanisms of il1-mediated inflammation tissue remodelling and cell growth the source s of sil1rap deficiency in the peripheral blood and the involved regulatory pathways need to be investigated the authors declare that they have no competing interests nm performed the experiments and wrote the first version of the manuscript ma contributed
