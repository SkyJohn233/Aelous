Jan 16, 2015 7:05 PM Jan 16, 2015 7:05 PM Hi all, I bought a used microcell tower, but I can't use it because the last user didn't disconnect it. There is no way to contact them. What am I to do?

Customer Support has, in times, deactivated a MicroCell if the account is no longer active ( not a standard procedure though)  but if the account is still active, they are very hesitant to do that for obvious reasons.

In order to add the device to your account, we will indeed need to disconnect it from the previous linked account first. In order to do so, we will require additional information. Please send us a private message ( https://forums.att.com/t5/notes/privatenotespage ) including the following so we can get you up and running as quickly as possible! Thanks!
