OpenStack Docs: Availability zones An availability zone groups network nodes that run services like DHCP, L3, FW,and others. It is defined as an agent s attribute on the network node. Thisallows users to associate an availability zone with their resources so that theresources get high availability. An availability zone is used to make network resources highly available. Theoperators group the nodes that are attached to different power sources underseparate availability zones and configure scheduling for resources with highavailability so that they are scheduled on different availability zones. The core plug-in must support the  availability_zone  extension. The coreplug-in also must support the  network_availability_zone  extension toschedule a network according to availability zones. The  Ml2Plugin  supportsit. The router service plug-in must support the  router_availability_zone extension to schedule a router according to the availability zones. The L3RouterPlugin  supports it. The  availability_zone  attribute can be defined in  dhcp-agent  and l3-agent . To define an availability zone for each agent, set thevalue into  [AGENT]  section of  /etc/neutron/dhcp_agent.ini  or /etc/neutron/l3_agent.ini : To confirm the agent s availability zone: The following attributes are added into network and router: Use  availability_zone_hints  to specify the zone in which the resource ishosted: Availability zone is selected from  default_availability_zones  in /etc/neutron/neutron.conf  if a resource is created without availability_zone_hints : To confirm the availability zone defined by the system: Look at the  availability_zones  attribute of each resource to confirm inwhich zone the resource is hosted: Â  Note The  availability_zones  attribute does not have a value until theresource is scheduled. Once the Networking service schedules the resourceto zones according to  availability_zone_hints ,  availability_zones shows in which zone the resource is hosted practically. The availability_zones  may not match  availability_zone_hints . Forexample, even if you specify a zone with  availability_zone_hints , allagents of the zone may be dead before the resource is scheduled. Ingeneral, they should match, unless there are failures or there is nocapacity left in the zone requested. Set  AZAwareWeightScheduler  to  network_scheduler_driver  in /etc/neutron/neutron.conf  so that the Networking service schedules anetwork according to the availability zone: The Networking service schedules a network to one of the agents within theselected zone as with  WeightScheduler . In this case, scheduler refers to dhcp_load_type  as well. Set  AZLeastRoutersScheduler  to  router_scheduler_driver  in file /etc/neutron/neutron.conf  so that the Networking service schedules a routeraccording to the availability zone: The Networking service schedules a router to one of the agents within theselected zone as with  LeastRouterScheduler . Although, the Networking service provides high availability for routers andhigh availability and fault tolerance for networks  DHCP services, availabilityzones provide an extra layer of protection by segmenting a Networking servicedeployment in isolated failure domains. By deploying HA nodes across differentavailability zones, it is guaranteed that network services remain available inface of zone-wide failures that affect the deployment. This section explains how to get high availability with the availability zonefor L3 and DHCP. You should naturally set above configuration options for theavailability zone. Set the following configuration options in file  /etc/neutron/neutron.conf so that you get L3 high availability. HA routers are created on availability zones you selected when creating therouter. Set the following configuration options in file  /etc/neutron/neutron.conf so that you get DHCP high availability. DHCP services are created on availability zones you selected when creating thenetwork.  Except where otherwise noted, this document is licensed under  Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License .
