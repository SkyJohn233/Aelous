testimonials amy haggerty for all your home buying and selling needs last year i contacted a work colleague whose opinion i trust without question while looking for an ottawa realtor my wife and i were looking for a new home in ottawa during a very stressful period in our lives we were on a strict budget and we had several prerequisites for any potential home/ neighbourhood we were several months looking and reviewed several neighbourhoods all of which amy patiently provided her expertise on i was always impressed with her knowledge of the market and the neighbourhoods when we finally found the pot of gold new home we had to move fast and manage a number of very challenging hurdles quite frankly i do n't know how we could have pulled off our home purchase if amy was n't representing us she is meticulous punctual and well versed in the latest communication technology but most importantly she is very personable i have yet to meet someone from the east coast who was n't an all round nice person and amy is no exception during our purchase she had a list of home buying support professionals lawyers inspectors etc to call on in short notice who were just as capable as she is she managed all the documentation for us and her follow up was second to none i have been transferred through my work many times and i have moved all over the province a number of times the majority of my homes i have sold and purchased privately over the years i have had several experiences with realtors none of whom would i ever write a reference for amy changed my opinion of realtors and proved to me there are legitimate realtors out there who actually do care about their clients and do provide a valuable service in a nutshell i am suspicious pessimistic and i always expect the worst in situations and people but this lady i trust implicitly this realtor is worth 5 not 2.5 keller williams has a winner in this agent and we will definitely come back we 're so happy to have met

first-time home buyers we were very nervous when we started to search for a house that could become our long-term home buying a house is the biggest investment we have ever made so we wanted to do it right the first time round we hoped and prayed to find an agent who has the knowledge experience and patience to guide us through this daunting process luckily we found amy from the time of our first meeting we had a good feeling about enlisting amy 's services because she was extremely knowledgeable and professional yet personable knowing that we lacked any experience on how to navigate the world of real estate amy took the extra time to familiarize us with the entire house-purchase process then patiently guided us along each step she offered many useful suggestions and tips when we went to look at houses together pointing out the good and not-so-good aspects of each house and bringing to our attention many important details that we would otherwise miss during this entire journey she was never pushy or rushed but gave us the time and freedom to make our own informed decisions she was also extremely resourceful when it came to negotiating the terms of our final offer we feel that amy always went above and beyond what a typical real-estate agent would do for their clients at each step of the way we are extremely happy with the house we ended up buying and with amy 's help the process felt much more smooth and enjoyable than we expected we would highly and unreservedly recommend amy to anyone who is looking to buy or sell a house whether a first-time buyer or otherwise when we contacted amy we were looking for a very specific style of house in a very specific area of stittsville that narrowed down our possibilities quite a bit amy was very patient with us and was determined to keep scouring the market until she found exactly what we were looking for amy made us feel like we had a good friend helping us through the task of finding our home we trusted her judgment all the way and never felt pressured or that she was leading us 'astray thanks to amy we have found our 'forever home thanks amy we met amy during a casual visit to an open house and we were impressed by her friendly demeanour when we made the decision to get the help of a professional agent she was the one we called throughout the entire searching and buying process she was a great help
