Mix a handful of sand, very fine grit or bulb compost from a nursery into the bottom of the planting hole to help improve drainage. Most bulbs need to be planted three times their own depth, but Madonna lilies should be buried only 2.5-5cm below the surface   and some gardeners advise leaving its tip above the surface.
