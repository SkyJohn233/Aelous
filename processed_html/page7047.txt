NordicTrack Sleep Plush? : Mattress Any feedback on the NordicTrack Sleep mattress/bed?  We were trying beds out today at Mattress Firm and my wife liked the NordicTrack really well.  Not as much for all the features but just for the comfort of the bed.  I &# x27;ve not been able to find any review from credible and unbias sources.  I haven &# x27;t been able to find anything on durability and I hate shopping without strong reviews. We &# x27;ve also been considering a Sleep Science bed from Costco. Reviews are useless for determining durability, since it is impossible to find a review of the exact same mattress from someone who has had it for 5 years or longer. To find a mattress that should last 5- to 10-years or longer, you need to make sure that there are no low-quality materials. Many mattress sellers will not be able to provide you with the necessary information to make this determination, in which case skip them. For those that can provide detailed material information, you need to check the foam types and densities for every foam layer in the mattress (you can also ask for thickness of every layer to check if it adds up correctly). For anyone over 200-pounds, there should be no memory-foam with density less than 5-pcf (pounds per cubic foot) and no polyurethane-foam (polyfoam) with density less than 2.0-pcf. Heavier people should also avoid softer latex-foam with firmness less than about 25-ILD. For anyone under 200-pounds, no memory-foam less than 4-pcf and no polyfoam less than 1.8-pcf, and any firmness of natural or blended latex-foam should be fine.
