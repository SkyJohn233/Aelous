The base- 10 ,       or  " common " , log is popular for  historical       reasons , and is       usually written as  " log ( x ) " .       For instance, pH (the measure of a substance's acidity or alkalinity),       decibels (the measure of sound intensity), and the Richter scale (the       measure of earthquake intensity) all involve base- 10        logs. If a log has no base written, you should generally (in algebra       classes) assume that the base is  10 . The other important log       is the  " natural " , or base- e ,       log, denoted as  " ln ( x ) "        and usually pronounced as  " ell-enn-of- x " .       (Note: That's  " ell-enn " , not  " one-enn "  or  " eye-enn " !)       Just as the number  e        arises naturally in math and the sciences, so also does the natural log,       which is why you need to be familiar with it. Warning: If you eventually       progress to much-more advanced mathematics, you may find that sometimes        " log ( x ) "        means the base- e        log or even base- 2        log, rather than the common log. Because the common and       natural logs are pretty much the only logs that are used  " in real       life " , these are the only two for which you have calculator keys.       Make sure you know where these keys are, and how to use them. Aside: Why would the  " natural       log "  be denoted by  " ln " ,       rather than by  " nl " ?       One popular idea relates to Euler ( " OY-lur " ), the guy who discovered       (invented?) the  natural       exponential . Euler       was Swiss and spoke French, so he might have called the function  " le       Logarithme Naturel " , rather than  " the natural log " , in       which case,  " ln "        makes sense. However, history shows that Euler actually used just  " l ( x ) "        for the logarithm using  " his "  number  e        as its base. Advertisement The first published use of the  " ln "        notation for the base- e        logarithm was Stringham's, in his 1893 text  " Uniplanar Algebra " .       Prof. Stringham was an American, so I have no idea why he would have used       the notation  " ln " ,       other than perhaps to reflect a common, though mistaken, idea that Napier's       log was a base- e        log. That is,  " ln "        might have meant to stand for  " Log of Napier " . It is even possible that the  " ln "        notation is a mistake: A European mathematician once proposed abbreviating        " log "        as  " lg "        and then using a script  " l "        for the function, with, effectively, a little squiggle afterwards which       was meant to indicate a subscripted italic  " g " .       But in the graphic I've seen, the  " g "        looks much more like an  " n " .       Some of the other proposed notations for the natural logarithm were even       more odd. Mercator (not the map guy) used a Latin       form of the term,  " log naturalis "  in his 1668 book on logarithms,       and, as of the late 1800s, various English-speakers were using the notation        " log.nat. "        for the natural logarithm. In short, the origin of this notation seems       somewhat obscure, perhaps even unknown, which is unusual for such a recent        " invention " . Since  100         = 10 2 ,         then  log (100)         =  log (10 2 ) = 2 ,         because  " log (100)         =  y "          means  " 10 y          = 100 = 10 2 " ,         so  y          = 2 . log (100)           = 2 Plug  " log (100) "        into your calculator, and you'll get the same answer. Since  98          is not a nice neat power of  10          (the way that  100          was), I cannot be clever with exponents to arrive at an exact answer.         On this exercise, I am stuck with using my calculator to get an approximate         value. So I'll plug this into my calculator, remembering to use the          " LOG "  key (not the  " LN "  key), and I get  log (98)         = 1.99122607569...,          or: log (98)           = 1.99 , rounded to two decimal           places Remember that  " ln (         ) "  means the         base- e          log, so  " ln ( e 4.5 ) "          might be thought of as  " log e ( e 4.5 ) " .         The Relationship says that  " ln ( e 4.5 )         =  y "          means  " e          y          =  e 4.5 " ,         so  y          = 4.5 , and: ln ( e 4.5 )           = 4.5 Plug  " ln ( e 4.5 ) "        into your calculator, and you'll get the same answer. (Make sure you put       parentheses around the  " e 4.5 " ,       so the calculator knows that the exponent is inside the log.) Since  2          is a nice neat whole number and since  e          isn't, then it is unlikely that  2          is a nice neat power of  e .         So I can't simplify this expression by being clever with exponents.         Instead, I'll have to evaluate this in my calculator, getting an approximate         answer of  ln (2)         = 0.69314718056...,          or: ln (2)           = 0.69,  rounded to two decimal           places. The graph of a logarithm       looks similar to that of a square root: However, the square-root       graph stops at the point  (0,       0) , while the logarithm       graph does not pass through the origin, but instead passes through  (1,       0)  and then continues       down along the right-hand (positive) side of the  y -axis.       Since the log function is the  inverse        of the  exponential        function, the graph of the log is the flip of the graph of the exponential: The exponential rides along       the top of the  x -axis,       crosses the  y -axis       at the point  (0,       1) , and then shoots       up. The logarithm rides up the right side of the  y -axis,       crosses the  x -axis       at the point  (1,       0) , and then shoots       right.
