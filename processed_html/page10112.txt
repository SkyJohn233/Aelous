This chapter describes two techniques for simple determination of virus titer in the baculovirus expression system using GFP co-expression and rapid monitoring of Sf-9 insect cell infection using a combination of GFP and the early-to-late (ETL) promoter of the virus vector. Because of its early appearance, GFP, when placed under the control of ETL promoter, will facilitate vector construction, virus isolation, and titer determination. Springer Nature is developing a new tool to find and evaluate Protocols. Learn more It is important to know the titer of a recombinant baculovirus stock, expressed in plaque-forming units (pfu/mL), when preparing new virus stocks or when carrying out infections for protein production. The productivity of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is sensitive to cell density, viability, nutrient levels, and the multiplicity of infection (MOI), which is the ratio of added infectious virus particles to viable cells at the time of infection. Thus, it is important to know both the viable cell concentration in the bioreactor and the infectious virus particle concentration in the virus stock. With the virus titer and the viable cell number, one can optimize production of the desired protein. The viable cell number can be determined by hemacytometer counting using Trypan Blue staining [ 1 ]. The titer of a recombinant baculovirus stock is commonly determined either by plaque assay [ 2 ] (also  see  Chapter    4 ) or by end-point dilution [ 1 ] (also  see  Chapter    10 ). Other methods of titering a baculovirus stock are given in Chapters    5  and    11 . While the plaque assay has the potential to accurately determine the virus titer, it is difficult to perform and requires a long processing time (up to ~1 week). Furthermore, visualizing plaques can be difficult. While the end-point dilution method is easier to set up, the results are often more difficult to interpret than plaque assays, particularly when titrating recombinant virus stocks. Wild-type virus is easily detected because of the accumulation of its occlusion bodies, but recombinant virus infection can sometimes be difficult to detect because of the lack of occlusion bodies. To distinguish between infected and uninfected cells, a decrease in cell density and an increase in cell size [ 3 ] are monitored (with difficulty) by regular light microscopy. To enhance the existing titration methods, alternative techniques for baculovirus titration have continued to emerge [ 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ]. One strategy incorporates heterologous reporter proteins for the detection and purification of proteins upon infection by baculovirus [ 10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ]. For example, Sussman [ 12 ] introduced the bacterial  E. coli  β-galactosidase (β-gal) gene ( lacZ ) into transfer vectors for enhancing assay efficacy and simplicity. Thereafter, many commercially available transfer vectors contained this marker gene. However, the use of this marker requires an additional expensive substrate (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside [X-gal]), which must be added in an additional step near the end of the assay. On the other hand, fluorescent reporter proteins, which can be easily observed upon chromophore excitation [ 16 ,  17 ], are equally promising and simpler. By incorporating the gene for a fluorescent protein (e.g., green fluorescent protein, GFP) instead of  lacZ  into the baculovirus, a marker can be created for visualizing gene expression with no need for a substrate or other cofactors. GFP, one of the most popular fluorescence-based reporters used in biological and medical research [ 18 ], was originally isolated from the jellyfish,  Aequorea victoria , and was first described in 1962 [ 19 ]. GFP emits bright green light when simply exposed to ultraviolet (UV) or blue light, unlike other bioluminescent reporters. The emission of green light is due to the transfer of energy from the photoprotein, aequorin, to GFP [ 20 ]. The cDNA of GFP was cloned from  Aequorea victoria  in 1992 [ 21 ]. GFP is a 238-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 27 kDa [ 18 ]. GFP has a major absorption peak at 395 nm and a minor peak at 470 nm with a single emission peak at 509 nm [ 18 ]. GFP has several advantages, such as species-independent fluorescence and, unlike  lacZ , it requires no substrate, cofactor or additional proteins for detection. Unlike other reporters, e.g., luciferase or fluorescence-tagged antibodies, GFP does not necessarily require pretreatment prior to detection, such as fixation techniques that are toxic to the cells under investigation [ 22 ]. As such, GFP has been widely used. Multiple reviews of GFP and its variants have appeared [ 16 ,  23 ,  24 ,  25 ] ( see Note 1 ). The BEVS has been increasingly utilized for a variety of purposes, ranging from gene therapy [ 26 ] to vaccine development [ 27 ,  28 ], and also importantly as one of the primary platforms for recombinant protein production [ 29 ]. That is, the BEVS is both effective and convenient for the overproduction of recombinant proteins in eukaryotic cells [ 30 ,  31 ,  32 ,  33 ,  34 ]. The strong polyhedrin (polh) promoter [ 35 ,  36 ] and the 10 kDa fibrous polypeptide (p10) promoter [ 33 ,  37 ], are both active in the very late phase of virus infection and when used to drive heterologous protein production can result in the accumulation of over 50 % of the total protein [ 38 ]. Also, relatively recent metabolic engineering approaches to increase yield further have appeared, such as those using RNAi [ 39 ,  40 ,  41 ]. Although high protein productivity can be achieved with the use of late promoters (polh or p10), these might not be ideal for probing the infection process due to the lag time between infection and polh-mediated protein synthesis (48 h post-infection). Early on, Crawford and Miller [ 42 ] characterized the role of several early baculovirus genes on the expression of late viral genes and noted that the early-to-late (ETL) promoter might advantageous for aiding the identification of occlusion-body negative recombinants via expression of β-galactosidase. Similarly, Richardson et al. [ 13 ] demonstrated the use of early and late promoters, including the ETL promoter, to facilitate the plaque assay. Hence, an optimal system might utilize the ETL promoter for monitoring infection [ 43 ,  44 ] and the p10 or polh promoters for protein production.

Excise the  gfp uv  gene from the pGFPuv plasmid using  Pst I and  Eco RI digestion. Insert the  gfp uv  gene (from  step 1 ) under the polyhedron (polh) promoter of the pVL1392 baculovirus transfer vector to obtain the pVLGFPuv transfer vector [ 45 ], which is subsequently amplified in  E. coli  ( see Note 3 ).

Propagate recombinant virus stocks in Sf-9 cells using Hink’s TNM-FH insect medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum in 25 cm 2  tissue-culture flasks at 27 °C. Grow Sf-9 cells in SF900-II SFM medium and subculture routinely every 3–4 days [ 1 ]. Count cell number using a hemacytometer. Determine cell viability by trypan blue exclusion using a 0.4 % (w/v) solution. Dilute the virus stock samples serially 10 −4 , 10 −5 , 10 −6 , 10 −7  and 10 −8  by transferring 100 μL from the previous diluted sample into a new tube that has 900 μL fresh medium, e.g., 100 μL of the 10 −4  sample into 900 μL fresh medium to obtain the 10 −5  sample. Each sample has an equal final volume of 900 μL, except the 10 −8  dilution, which has a final volume of 1000 μL. Harvest 3 × 10 6  Sf-9 cells from the exponential growth phase and add fresh medium to obtain a total volume of 30 mL. This will result in a cell density of 10 5  cells/mL. Mix 0.5 mL of each virus dilution ( step 1 ) with 4.5 mL of the Sf-9 cell suspension ( step 2 ) to obtain a total volume of 5.0 mL. Gently mix. Pipet 100 μL of the virus/cell samples obtained in  step 3  into 12 replicate wells of a 96-well plate for each virus dilution. Prepare a total of four plates for time course observation ( see Note 6 ). Incubate the plates obtained in  step 4  at 27 °C for 4–7 days. Check each well for virus infection on a UV table. Green light, which is due to GFP expression, indicates virus infection and thus a positive well ( see Note 7 ). Calculate the titer (pfu/mL) of the recombinant baculovirus  v GFPuv using the standard method described in Chapter    10  ( see Note 8 ). Infect Sf-9 cells during exponential growth (~10 6  cells/mL) with a predetermined volume of the  v P ETL -GFPuv and  v PH-GFPuv/CAT recombinant baculoviruses to yield a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 ( see Notes 9  and  10  and Chapter    1 ). Collect culture samples initially every 6 h for the first 60 h post-infection (p.i.) and then every 12 h thereafter. Prepare whole cells (from  step 2 ) without medium by centrifugation and resuspend in PBS buffer. Quantify GFP using whole cell fractions in PBS buffer (from  step 3 ) by fluorescence spectrometry at an excitation wavelength of 395 nm and an emission wavelength of 509 nm. Examine GFP production (from whole cell fractions) via Western blot as a function of time post-infection using samples collected in  step 2 . Prepare a 1.5-mm thick, 10 % gel by mixing 7.5 mL of 4× separating buffer, with 10 mL acrylamide/bis solution, 12.5 mL water, 100 μL ammonium persulfate solution, and 20 μL TEMED. Pour the gel, leaving space for a stacking gel, and overlay with water-saturated isobutanol. The gel should polymerize in about 30 min. Pour off the isobutanol and rinse the top of the gel twice with water. Prepare the stacking gel by mixing 2.5 mL of 4× stacking buffer with 1.3 mL acrylamide/bis solution, 6.1 mL water, 50 μL ammonium persulfate solution, and 10 μL TEMED. Use about 0.5 mL of this to quickly rinse the top of the gel and then pour the stack and insert the comb. The stacking gel should polymerize within 30 min. Prepare the running buffer by diluting 100 mL of the 4× running buffer with 400 mL water in a measuring cylinder. Cover with Para-Film and invert to mix. Once the stacking gel has set, carefully remove the comb and use a 3-mL syringe fitted with a 22-gauge needle to wash the wells with running buffer. Add the running buffer to the upper and lower chambers of the gel unit and load 50 μL of each sample in a well. Include one well for prestained molecular weight markers. Complete the assembly of the gel unit and connect to a power supply. The gel can be run either overnight at 50 V or, if cooling is available for the gel unit, then during the day (about 5 h) at 20 mA through the stacking gel and 30–40 mA through the separating gel. Electrophoretically transfer the samples that have been separated by SDS-PAGE onto supported nitrocellulose membranes ( see Note 11 ). Incubate the nitrocellulose in 50 mL blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature on a rocking platform. Discard the blocking buffer and rinse the membrane quickly prior to addition of a 1:1000 dilution of the anti-GFP antibody in TTBS/2 % BSA for 1 h at room temperature on a rocking platform. Remove the primary antibody and wash the membrane three times for 5 min each with 50 mL TTBS. Prepare fresh secondary antibody for each experiment as 1:5000-fold dilution in blocking buffer and add to the membrane for 30 min at room temperature on a rocking platform. Discard the secondary antibody and wash the membrane six times for 10 min each with TTBS. During the final wash, warm 2 mL aliquots of each portion of the BCIP/NBT reagent separately to room temperature. After removing final wash from the blot, add the BCIP/NBT reagent to the blot. Western blot analyses of GFP expression under ETL ( filled triangle ) and polh ( open square ) promoters. ( a ) Developed Western blots. ( b ) Quantified results that were normalized to the first non-zero intensities from scanned images (12 h p.i., ETL signal) GFP fluorescence intensity for control ( filled circle ) and cultures infected with  v P ETL -GFPuv ( filled triangle ) and  v PH-GFPuv/CAT ( open square ). ( a ) Fluorescence intensity over entire culture time. ( b ) Fluorescence intensity for first 48 h p.i. In this research, a GFP variant, GFPuv, which is optimized for UV excitation [ 22 ], can be used. GFPuv is 18 times brighter than wild-type GFP and can be easily detected by the naked eye when excited with standard, long-wave UV light (e.g., source for many DNA transilluminator light tables). Note that this variant is ideally suited for this work because there is a large difference between the optimal excitation and emission wavelengths and because its intrinsic brightness is so high. Also, other GFP variants and fluorescent proteins, e.g., EGFP, BFP, YFP, and CFP [ 16 ,  23 ,  24 ,  25 ], could be used depending on the specific purposes or situations (e.g.,  see  Luo et al. [ 46 ] and Yi et al. [ 47 ]). This is a neurotoxin when unpolymerized and so care should be taken to avoid exposure. This strategy leaves the p10 promoter (another strong baculovirus promoter) available for the expression of genes of interest from the same virus. Successful co-transfection can be observed through green fluorescence using a fluorescence microscope. This method has several advantages. First, this modified method is substantially faster than the normal end-point method. This is an important advantage because we currently wait longer (about 5–7 days for end-point dilution and 6–7 days for plaque assays) for detecting infection. Second, this method makes unambiguous the determination of positive (infected) wells. That is, the titer of recombinant baculovirus is obtained by simply placing the 96-well plate on the UV box and counting the green light emitting wells. Note that the GFPuv marker can also be applied to plaque assays for more easily visualizing plaques. Four plates are used so that results can be checked daily from day 4 to day 7, in the event that UV lights are to damage the cells and a given plate can only be read once. Although we have hypothesized that UV light may have a damaging effect on the cells, we have not experienced such difficulty, particularly because exposure time is routinely kept brief. Furthermore, we can check the plates for infection each day during the 7-day incubation to test whether the results are dependent on incubation time. We can check the infected wells by eye and count green light-emitting wells. The orders of magnitude of calculated titer are the same (10 7 ) in all end-point dilution plates for each day. Furthermore, the values are similar among all samples and within the standard error of the calculated average titer, 5 × 10 7  pfu/mL. Finally, there is no significant difference observed in plates read once and plates read three times (on consecutive days) after illumination on the UV table. The intent of this experiment is to compare the infection of these two recombinant baculoviruses, i.e., to compare the use of the ETL promoter to that of the polyhedrin promoter. Effectiveness of baculovirus infection depends on cell culture conditions such as virus titer, initial cell number, initial cell viability, and medium composition. The colored molecular weight markers should be clearly visible on the membrane. Western blots indicate a clear shift of ~18 h for ETL-driven expression in comparison to that expressed via the polh promoter. The ETL-driven GFP reaches a maximum at 50 h p.i., after which the accumulation level declines steadily. The decrease is possibly due to proteolysis [ 48 ] and/or cell lysis following virus infection, although the latter is less likely given the previously observed persistence of GFP from the very late polh vectors. Under the polh promoter, GFP is detected at approximately 42 h p.i. with a maximum at 96 h p.i. followed by a sharp decrease. These results correspond well to the expected profile, where immediate-early and delayed-early genes are expressed between 0 and 10 h p.i., the transition to the late phase occurring between 10 and 15 h p.i., and the very late genes express after 18 h p.i. [ 49 ]. Consistent with Western blots, the GFP fluorescence intensity under the polh promoter increases rapidly after 42 h p.i. until reaching a maximum at ~96 h p.i., but without a marked decline. Under the early ETL promoter, GFP fluorescence remains low and fairly constant after 48 h p.i., but increases initially near 18 h p.i. ( see  inset in Fig.  2a ) resulting in a similar 18 h time shift observed by Western analysis.
