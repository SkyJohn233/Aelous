optica prints vue optique realetti prospettive guckkastenbild by kees kaldenbach more info about the author see some samples of optica prints for sale little has heen published particularly in english on the type of print known as the perspective view intended for use in an optical diagonal machine nevertheless these prints were highly popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and still appear regularly on the art market lt therefore seems worth collecting what information is known and adding what i have heen able to discover 1 this article opens with a discussion of the various types of optical diagonal machine andhow they function this is followed by a brief sketch based on material taken from eighteenth- and nineteenth century catalogues and household inventories of the social classes who owned thern the final section is devoted to an examination of the different characteristics of the perspective views produced in the four main centres london paris augsburg and bassano particular attedtion is paid here to two draughtsmen who worked for publishers in augsburg the optical diagonal machine zograscope the optical diagonal machine is a viewing apparatus whose main components are a large double convex lens and a mirror fixeddirectly behind it at an angle these are attached either on top of a pyramid shaped box or on top of a stand when the spectator looks at perspective views through the lens of the viewing machine an illusion of recession is produced in principe a similar illusion of distance can he achieved simply by using a single detachedconvex lens which is larger than the distance between two human eyes at least ten centimetres when this lens is held just in front of the eyes the spectator is looking at the perspective view through its two edges which function like two prisms light rays bouncing off the print are refracted in such a way that they enterthe eyes in a parallel direction the brain interprets the incoming parallel images as a single image seen from a great distance the important function of the lens in the optical machine is not its magnification but its creation of an illusion of depth in binocular vision so that the greatest illusion of recession can be achieved theperspective view should be designed according to strict principles of linear perspective with a distant object placed in the centre of the print for example a view looking down a receding street works well because all horizontal lines in the buildings appear as lines converging at the same vanishing point the interior of a large building such as a cathedral is also suitable for creating a successful illusion of depth fig 37 the least effective pointof view is perpendicular to a facade such as a row of houses or to the front of a palace because from that viewpoint there is no effect of perspective in any case the angle of vision for anyperspective view should be wider than the angle of forty-sixdegrees which corresponds to the human eye 's normal range ofvision this explains why perspective views have an appearancesimilar to a photograph taken with a wide-angle lens of courseperspective views are not the only images which can be used withthe optical machine any two-dimensional image such as a paintingor a mural would be suitable however the illusion of recessionthe latter would give to the spectator would depend on theemphasis on linear perspective their images had the most basic and at thesame time effective model of a viewing machine is the table modelon a stand whose lens is at eye level when the viewer is seated infigure 36 the woman louise-sebastiennegély later to marry danton is showing a perspective viewto a boy probably antoine danton'seldest son so as to avoid any distortion which might be causedthrough the print curling if it were held manually this model ofthe optical machine incorporates a mirror fitted at an angledirectly behind the lens which thus permits the prints to be viewedlying on a flat surface the function of the mirror is simply toget round the problem of curling it plays no part in creating theillusion of depth nevertheless it has the consequence that theimage is seen upside down and reversed for this reason many viewshave the text not only at the bottom of the print in the normaldirection but also at the top in reverse and often in largecapitals so that it can be read when viewed through the opticalmachine some views but not all were also executed in mirrorimage so that they would be seen in the right direction through theviewing apparatus see fig- 38 for example this of course issimple for the engraver who does not have to worry about problemsof reversal when engraving the plate perspective prints optical prints perspective views were produced from the early eighteenthcentury to the beginning of the nineteenth the greatest number ofthem probably between c. 1740-1790 3 lt is difficult to give them a precise definition because oftheir many variations but there are a number of commoncharacteristics firstly they are usually etched and invariably designed to be seenthrough a viewing machine with consequent reversals of text andimage the size of the image is about 23 by 40 centimetres and theentire plate with text about 30 by 45 centimetres sizes vary by5 to 10 centimetres at the most perspective views are alwayshorizontal in format since the subject-matter is usuallytopographical they often show monumental buildings palaces churches or town halls or characteristic parts of towns gates squares streets or harbours for example more rarely they showportraits depict moralistic or biblical themes or historicalevents such as the demolition of the bastille or the ascent ofhot-air balloons to name two of the more popular the etcher would usually work after existing prints less oftenafter specially-prepared drawings and more rarely still afterpaintings the plates were probably etched in the workshops of thepublisher lt is likely that the publisher controlled the wholeoperation although there is no evidenee that the printing andhand-colouring were done in the same workshop all theseperspective views have a strong common factor in the nature oftheir execution the etcher paid special attention to the straightlines in architecture and accentuated horizontal lines inbuildings to enhance the perspective at the same time he paidlittle attention to surface detail or texture or to the contrastbetween light and shade lt is often impossible in these prints todetermine the material of which a building has been constructed -brick stone or stucco for example although to some extent thisdifficulty is overcome by the use of hand-colouring the care takenin this however was only noticeable in views produced in london.in general one can say that the quality of colouring in perspectiveviews is superior to that found on popular woodcuts of the time although nowhere near the standard reached in prints designed asworks of art perspective views served a different purpose fromartistic prints the viewer could make a voyage imaginaire for his own instructionand pleasure by selecting a certain series of views he could makea 'journey possibly together with others through cities eitherknown or unknown to him the prime concern was whether the imagewas recognizable its artistic quality was less relevant thestylistic changes of the period do not appear to have held anyinfluence over the etchers the contemporary authors speak of theimportance of obtaining an illusion of reality for exampie johanbischoff states in 1764 that names for the viewing machines and perspectiveprints names for the viewing machines and perspectiveprints vary more in britain than on the continent cataloguesproduced by british print publishers of the eighteenth andnineteenth centuries give a number of alternative tities in hiscatalogue of 1717 henry overton i calls them 'prospects a termalso used in the 1731 john bowies catalogue 'prospects neatlygraved each on one large sheet of paper if the henry overton iicatalogue of 1754 merely mentions 'views each on one sheet oflarge paper a much fuller description appears in the caringtonbowles catalogue of 1784 'sets of fine prints perspective views the following setsconsists of a large variety of perspective views containingremarkabie views of shipping eminent cities towns royal palaces noblemen and gentiemans seats and gardens in great britain franceand holland views of venice florence ancient and modern rome and the most striking public buildings in and about london meanwhile the laurie and whittie catalogue of 1795 speaksof similarly robert laurie 's 1824 catalogue lists perspective views coloured for the show glass or diagonalmirror it was probably the scientifieinstrument-maker george adams who coined the term zograscope to replace all these cumbrousexpressions but the name did not catch on on the continent namesfor the viewing machines and perspective prints were less diverse.in france where the viewing machine was believed to haveoriginated the prints were called vued'optique or vueperspective and the apparatus itself simply optique or boîte d'optique in germany the viewswere known as guckkastenbild 'or guckkastenblatt literally'looking-box-sheet while the optical machine wascalled guckkasten meanwhilein ltaly realetti prospettive 'were viewed in camereottiche whilst in holland an opticaprent was looked at in an optica various models of the viewing machine various models of theviewing machine are known the rijksmuseum for example boaststwo the first model consists of a lens with a mirror placed at anangle directly behind it and is held in a simple wooden frame supported by a wooden pillar similar models are shown in figs 36and 43 the science museum in london has a comparable model madeby the scientifie instrument-maker edward nairne of the firm nairne blunt whose premises were at 'no 20 opposite the royalexchange cornhill london this is a more sophisticated machine with a balancing system for both the lens and the mirror while thetop section can be raised and lowered into the pillar lt is 66centimetres in height has a lens of 11 centimetres in diameter and also an ornamental frame 5 the second viewing machine in the rijkmuseum donated in 1980 bylady c.j six together with a collection of perspective views isa wooden four- sided pyramid-shaped model about 70 centimetreshigh see fig 39 lt has three closed sides and one open side the latter bearing a row of candle holders which permit the printsto be viewed by candlelight as well as daylight this model can beingeniously folded up into the book shaped box which constitutesits base on the spine the book title reads perspective views inenglish cut out or illuminating optica a horizontal variation of this standing pyramid-shaped model is the 'illuminating optica which has a lensbut no mirror fig 40 views for this type of apparatus had to bespecially prepared the print was first glued on to stiff card andholes were cut out of those sections where the building hadwindows whilst punchmarks served to indicate where chineselanterns and festoons might hang on the back of these windows andholes coloured paper was glued often bright red and oiled infront of and behind the view candles were lit giving to the wholea magical and otherworldly quality the theatre museum in amsterdamdisplays such an 'illuminating optica lt has an unusual lens ground out of a square piece of glass which gives a lesserillusion of depth than the two models in the rijkmuseum 6 around 1850 thestereoscope and the accompanying double 'stereo photographs appeared on the market this instrument produced an illusion ofdepth greatly superior to that of the standard viewing machine inthe period of transition hetween the viewing machine and thestereoscope another simple apparatus had been invented which wassuitabie for viewing both perspective views and stereoscopicphotographs this consisted of a vertical panel about 35centimetres high fig- 41 on the upper part of which was fittedone large lens and on the lower part two smaller ones behindwhich the stereoscopic photograps could be placed in a smallframe the panel was hinged at the bottom to a box which wassomewhat larger than the panel itself 7 in addition to these apparatus other optical gadgets were available on the market which appear to have been equally popular with collectors as canbe seen hy examining dutch auction catalogues of the period take for example the catalogue of the auctioneers j. gaillard and b. scheurleer of the hague dated 16 september 1782 which describes the estate of the physician j. westerhoff 11 towards the end of this catalogue which mainly lists books there is a section headed 'curiosities which includes a number of scientific instruments some of these such as prisms and magnifying lenses would be considered serious instruments by the standards of the twentieth century whilst others such asmagic lanterns and shadow games would be judged more like toys others still would belong to a different category that of anamorphosis anamorphoses are images which appear unintelligible to normal perception only by the use of mirrors and glasses to correct the distortion do the images appear as recognizable shapes.the various optical instruments listed in this catalogue are specified as follows item 53 mentions a very nice englishedge-pillar mirror of metal very finely ground and polished in a tin tube to which belongs an artful painting in oils wide 27 high 21 thumbs this edge-pillar or in dutch kantzuil may bedefined as a cylinder having one or more flat surfaces item 55goes on to describe a very fine english cone mirror as finelyground as the preceding in a tin tube which is listed togetherwith two accompanying paintings here the spectator would view thecone with one eye immediately above its point and see thereflection of the painting on which the cone itself was positioned.meanwhile item .59 describes a cylindrical mirror with a paintingwhich was to be looked at at an angle from above in a very similarfashion to item 55 it is listed as a very nice english pyramidmirror as admirable as the preceding also in a tin tube item 64was 'an anamorphosis on a mahogany frame together with twofacet-glasses with which were also listed four drawings placed ona base then item 65 mentions a viewing machine a very nicemahogany illuminating box high 24 and wide 18 thumbs to which aneyeglass and twelve punctured illuminating views finally a fewother items of interest can he mentioned number 43 describing 'atin magic lantern with 36 movabie and fixed images painted onglass to which a mirror and a tube to use with rays of the sun and also numbers 46 to 50 which list a convex and a number ofconcave mirrors perhaps the earliestdescription of a viewing apparatus is that given by j. c.kohlhans in 1677 when he writes about a camera obscura used as aviewing machine and stresses the necessity of binocular vision inorder to achieve an illusion of depth in 1753 the englishman s.parrat described a box-shaped viewing apparatus with a lens but nomirror see fig 42 10 in order to standupright in this machine a perspective view had first to be gluedonto stiff card the rijksmuseum has a number of these prints.meanwhile the concave mirror is described in carlyeighteenth-century books as an instrument used to create anillusion of depth when looking at images for example ozanam récréations mathématiques et physiques paris 1735 describes the way a concave mirror works when placed in a'cham- breoptique the spectator looked through a hole in a box and saw inthe concave mirror on the opposite wall the reflection of a viewplaced below the viewing hole one can oneself put this to the testby using an ordinary shaving mirror which is concave and thusmagnifies if one holds an architectural view at chest height andthen stands with the mirror at arm 's length in front of one theresultant image has a noticeable illusion of depth even if themirror has a relatively small diameter another early descriptionand illustration of a viewing apparatus appears in the famous encyclopédie of 1767 by diderot and d'alembert figure 43 taken from the encyclopédie shows the simple model of theviewing machine on a pillar with a lens and a diagonally-placedmirror since there are no side walls on this model the amount oflight entering the machine is unlimited three years later guyot in a sequel to ozanam 's book 11 alsopublished a description of the viewing machine together with anillustration he wrote 'the looking-box with a diagonal mirror this type oflooking box is very well known because they are in manyhands little has been written about the question as to what type ofhousehold owned the viewing machine the most useful source ofinformation is the study by marie van dijk on dutch household inventories during the first halfof the nineteenth eentury 12 altogether van dijk researched 3,507 inventories probates and personalestates in 105 municipalities in holland and analysed them interms of the ownership of toys and games she differentiated five social groups a farmers b labourersand workers paid by the day c those without a trade d tradesmenand shop- keepers e notables and the well-to-do only the lattertwo groups were found to own optical machines in five cases fortradesmen and shopkeepers and in fourteen for notables and thewell-to-do the numbers of items recorded were as follows viewingmachines 12 magic lanterns 5 concave mirrors 5 conemirrors 2 peep-shows 2 a cylindrical mirror 1 and anilluminating optica 1 all of these apparatus being listed withaccompanying views either in the form of prints or views painted onglass one individual an 'entrepreneur owned several of theseoptical instruments the conclusion from van dijk 's study then was that theseoptical apparatus were owned only by the well-to-do in order tomeet the demands of the tax authorities these inventories suppliedestimated values the dutch guilder hfl or dfl was worth roughlyis 8d at that time van dijk found that the value of viewingmachines ranged considerably from dfl 3 or dfl 5 to as much asdfl 8 in an example where the apparatus included 100 views of thehighest quality or even dfl 10 citing two cases one in whichthe apparatus was estimated together with 60 views of the highestquality and the other referring to the viewing machine alone amagic lantern was estimated at dfl 7 while a cylindrical mirrorwas esti- mated together with a cone mirror at dfl 12 finally a peep-show was estimated at dfl 6 a price which included itsviews lamps and base prices for optical pritns and viewingmachines prices in london forperspective views and viewing machines can be found out moreeasily for example most auction catalogues give the price for aperspective view 1s for an uncoloured print and 2s for coloured.only the larger and more elaborate views of roman antiquities seefig 44 were considerably more expensive costing 10s 6duncoloured and £ 1 5s coloured a viewing machine meanwhile could be bought in some publisher 's shops as is apparent from thelaurie and whittle catalogue for 1795 diagonal mirrors forthe shewing of these views neatly fitted up in mahogany withlooking- glass one guinea each lt was also sold by scientific instrument-makers such as georgeadams for prices varying in the year 1769 from 18 shillings to £ 2.12 6d. although in subsequent years for example 1789 and 1797 the prices listed in his catalogues are more constant in augsburg perspectiveviews ranged in price from 1 to 2 augsburg florins or about is.8d to 3s- 4d at the rate of exchange in that period 13 however prices in paris were much lower an indication of wholesale prices in paris hasrecently been estimated by pierre casselle investigating theprobate inventory of the print publisher laurent pierre lachaussée which was drawn up by his colleague louis mondhare in may1782 14 casselle gives the followingprices 328 livres tournois for a group of 138 plates whichis 6 livres or 5 shillings each 112 livres tournois fora stack of 2,800 perspective views in black and white of'demi'-fine quality which is less than a sou or about one pennyeach and 6 livres tournois for 14 viewing machines anestimate which should probably he understood as 6 livres for themall the publisher remondini from bassano lists in his 1772 catalogue fourperspective views for 1 lira or five pennies if uncolouredand for 2 lire when coloured by 1784 however his priceswere about 20 lower with a wholsesale price of 20 lire for 100uncoloured views or 35 lire for 100 if coloured later still in1817 these prices dropped even further to 12,50 and 20,50 lirerespectively 15 remondini 's prices are thusclearly lower than those in london and augsburg but still higherthan the average price for a perspective view in holland which cost about two pennies eachaccording to the rate of exchange already cited 16 the latter information is derived from a collectionof late eighteenth-century dutch sale catalogues of books andcuriosities 17 some thirty of these havehad the prices of the books and curiosities jotted down in themargin evidently by the customer or the auc- tioneer these pricesare as follows from dfl 1 to dfl 10 for a viewing machine fromdfl 4 to dfl 36 for an illuminating optica dfl 5 foranamorphoses from dfl 7 to dfl 32 for magic lanterns with theexception of one which was priced at dfl 112 and finally dfl.0,10 or 2 pennies for perspective views sold in bundles of 10 or20 and a little more dfl 0,12 for illuminating views also soldin bundles of 10 or 20 the evidence indicaties then that only the well-to-do couldafford perspective views and the viewing machine 18 on an average wage of no more than one to twoshillings a day the german british or dutch labourer would havehardly been likely to afford such luxuries however the lesswell-off were able to become acquainted with perspective views atfairs and markets where travelling showmen displayed their views often with an accompanying story for a small fee as late as 1932the german author elsner von gronow could state that 'the optica is only known to our contemporaries from the annualfair perspective views produced in london perspective views produced in london are generally of high quality publisherswere apparently prepared to invest in competent draughtsmen engravers printers and colourers they can also be distinguishedfrom these made in the other centres by their colouring thus skiesare sometimes coloured in atmospheric perspective with dark blue atthe top shading towards a lighter blue on the horizon in general prints produced in londen are easy to identify in that inaccordance with the copyright act of 1734 they carry on them thename of the publisher and the date of publication this however may not invariably have heen done and many impressions have beentrimmed as part of the mounting operation there are thereforecases where certainty is not easily reached most of the views produced in london are of what may be termedthe'european standard size'- about 12 by 18 inches 300 by 450 mm this consistency of size would have followed the construction ofthe optical machines and doubtless promoted internationaldistribution of the views and also made copying and piracy aneasy matter the numbers of different prints produced in londen cannow be readily reassessed by examination of these catalogues putout by publishers of the period of these six have been examinedwhich offer information of importance to this study 19 they are as follows a henry overton i at the whitehorse without newgate 1717 this contains 24 pages listing in arather disorganized way maps 'prospects and 'views which maybe understood as perspective views of these i counted a total of164 overton 's stock descended to his cousins henry ii or to robertsayer or to both see below b john bowles at mercer 's hall cheapside 1731 of the 63 pages these on pages 28-30 list 56perspective views under the title 'prospects c robert sayer of the golden buckopposite fetter lane fleet street offered 202 views in 1753 although the title-page boasts 206 a further 14 can be found inhis 1755 supplementary sheet sayer 's stock was taken over by laurie whittle d henry overton ii also at thewhite horse without newgate listed 493 different views on pp.23-36 of his 1754 catalogue typographically it falls into twoparts a clearly laid-out text en pp 23-29 and a closely set texton pp 30-36 e carington bowles at 69 st paul'schurch yard had 267 views on pp 70-83 of his catalogue of 1784 f finally laurie whittle of 53fleet street had 231 views in 1795 listed on pp 49-57- note see all the way below for an addition tothis chart kk 2004 apart from these publishers known through their catalogues i have seen the names of other publishers on views in the rijksmuseum print room these are john tinney john boydell and f. mayor other prints were jointly published combinations of names that appear are sayer ardell overton sayer sayer boydell and sayer boydell overton some perspective views remained popular for many decades others did not sell as well and were discontinued and the printing plates sold in order to get an idea of the total number ofexisting perspective views and the continuity in popularity of certain groups of views i made a table of concordance of the titles found in these six catalogues from this table i compiled a 'flow chart fig 45 above in the flow chart a closed box indicaties one catalogue cach an arrow indicaties a descriptionwhich is the same in the two catalogues and the number on the arrow indicaties the number of identical titles it should be notedthat identical titles might mean that the plate was the same or it might point to a different plate whether a copy or completely unrelated as can be seen in the chart there is surprisingly little similarity between the titles of perspective views in these catalogues similarities exist in a few places only the 1753 sayer catalogue is almost entirely the same as the first part of the 1754 overton catalogue wording subdivisions and typography are very similar the c. bowles 1784 catalogue is quite different from theoverton 1754 catalogue except for a few scattered views only two groups of prints the gardens al stow and monamy 's sea pieces have identical tities greater similarity exists between the laurie and whittie 1795 catalogue and the combination sayer 1753 overton ii 1754 there are 100 views with identical titles which means that more than half of sayer 's stock has been omitted similarities exist in the sections london scotland ireland holland paris and monamy 's sea pieces the main problem that remains to he resolved is the significance of what appear to be identical prints being offered simultaneously by different publishers did they own the plate jointly or did they as suggested by antony griffiths in his article on britishprint publishers referred to in note 19 exchange stocks of prints from their own plates against stocks of prints from other publishers in order to spread the risk and balance their inventory further questions are raised by an examination of the collection of over 110 perspective views published in london which is now in the rijksmuseum many of them were given by lady c. j six who alsodonated the unique copy of the 1753/1755 sayer catalogue fig 46 since no fewer than 83 of the 202 prints listed in the 1753 catalogue and 13 of the 14 included in the 1755 supplement are to be found in the rijksmuseum the conclusion seems highly plausible that the catalogue was actually used by the six ancestors when placing their orders in the 1750 's no less than three versions of the lord mayor 's mansion in london are to he found in the amsterdamcollection figs- 47-50 they show the bewildering numbers ofcopies made of popular subjects and reveal the difficulties indeciding where any copy may have been made the first is animmaculate carefully coloured print fig 47 with blue skies white clouds and a pale horizon the buildings and street a reddishbrown sand colour and light brown and many bright colours in theclothing of the pcople and the carriages the caption reads this print first appears in sayers 's 1755 catalogue 20 the second is a mirror-image copy after the first very closecomparison shows that it is not a counterproof hut amazingly copied to the smallest detail figure 47a shows the right-hand bottom corner of the sayer print with next to it the almost identical part of the second print fig 48a 21 the latter has been glued onto stiff card and punched with tiny holes but it doesnot succeed as an iliumination view the paper on the back is white neither coloured nor transparant the overall impression shows a somewhat lesser quality of engraving the hatching in thebuilding does not contributie to the perspective as successfully as in the first view the text has been partially omitted and misunderstood by the engraver lt is likely that the french or ltalian engraver did not know english 'publiskdaccording to aclof paliament aag 20 1751 fig 48 another copy of the secondprint of which figure 49 shows a detail has successfully been turned into an illumination view with various holes cut into the cardboard the colouring is done in a sloppy way 22 the third print fig 50 is a copy by daumont from paris with a latin and french caption also a mirror image of the first 23 the sky is a solid blue on top and pink towards the roofs only certain parts of the carriages are coloured red and yellow perspective views produced in paris the fundamental study on perspective views from paris is the article by de keyser published in 1962 from which most of the following information is derived 24 perspective views made in paris are in general of a lower quality than those made in london the colouring is generally of a lesser quality than was customary inlondon and applied with a brush never through a stencil parisian publishers of perspective views were clustered in the rue saint jacques and the ateliers almost exclusively employed the technique of etching the names of the publisher and the city they lived in were usually printed but those of the engraver and designer seldomoccur de keyser has supplied a list of those names that are given he observes that they are not to be found in the standard reference works on the history of printmaking and draws the evident inference that the artists must all have been on a humble artisanal level in some cases it is clear that the publisher and theengraver are one and the same for example with chéreau and la chaussée according to elsner von gronow 25 the publishers issued the following numbers of different prints:174 by chéreau 86 by daumont 160 by mondhare 77 by huquier and 47 by maillet he does not state how many were issued by la chaussée and beauvais the total production which must haveheen considerable in paris declined after 1790 and was muchreduced by 1820 only basset keptpublishing until 1840 but hawkers were still showing such prints in the early twentieth century 26 the beginnings of the genre are more difficult to trace but dekeyser places it in the 1740s the subjects of the prints as in other countries were predominantly topographical showing towns and monuments from all over the world the implication is that views from outside france were plagiarized from other prints possibly many french views were as well other subjects that werepopular were great events and public festivals religious or moral themes are rarely found in france despite their great popularity in augsburg de keyser remarks on the gross inaccuracy of many prints and the fantasy that frequently inspired them which brings them more into the realm of the popular print than the fine print lt is however clear that even french vues doptique never descended to the level of the popular woodcut the market for themwas rather with the professional and middie classes and they seem to have enjoyed a wide circulation around the country the true popular print almost invariably a woodcut on the other hand was restricted in circulation and usually remained confined to the country or even locality in which it was produced a good exampleof the fantasy employed by french publishers is given by the crude copy of a print or a painting by claude lorrain which duly acknowledges him as the inventor but yet boldly states that the scene shows the harbour at rotterdam figs 51 and 52 perspective views produced in italy thanks to the large company run by the remondini family the ltalian town of bassano grew into an important centre of printed images perspective views were only one of the many kinds of prints made in their workshops giuseppe remondini employed an extensivenetwork of sales representatives in many european countries in order to compete successfully with the established european houses he had numerous perspective views copied from existing augsburg paris and london ones and issued these himself giving no indication of his own name and city but instead copied intact the original captions and the original publisher 's name such underhand practices led to a lawsuit in augsburg and a stock of remondini views was subsequentiy confiscated this may well have taken placeat the shop of fietta who represented remondini in augsburg this verdict did not restrain remondini who persisted in issuing copied views 27 a number of catalogues was issued between 1772 and 1817 in which different kinds of prints were advertised religious prints maps and popular prints amongst which were perspective views the number of different views was about 100 in 1772 about 200 in 1784 and almost 300 in 1817 ofwhich 200 were views of ltalian towns remondini 's views can be recognized by a code of numbers and three letters in the lower left-hand corner there is also often a bilingual text other ltalian publishers issued small numbers of perspective views giuseppe zocchi put out views offlorenee and tuscany and marieschi views of venice perspective views produced in augsburg augsburg was another importantcentre of books and prints the augsburg publishers succeeded in cornering an important part of the perspective view market from their london and paris competitors around 1770 the period of considerable production lasted until c. 1790 after which the production in all centres declined.28 the augsburg views were usually copied from existing prints often from foreign perspective views but errors were sometimes made in the captions possibly outof ignorance or carelessness thus a view by g.b probst with the title view of the kettel gate in delft depicts another town entirely the quality of the colouring in augsburg ranges from mediocre to sloppy patches of strong colour are applied by a pad or brush red for the roofs and clothing green in the trees andbrown in the water the number of colours is limited to four or five there are no changing hues of colour nor are the outlines of the objects coloured in carefully as in the london views this bold way of colouring was customary in catchpenny prints mr. wolfgang seitz the authority on augsburg views states thatabout 90 of the views he has seen were coloured for many years he has collected information on the different types of augsburg views not only perspective views in an index card system whichpresently contains over 10.000 cards in his typescript publication he mentions the most important publishers of perspective views georg balthasar probst 1732-1801 wasan engraver and publisher of at least 340 different views with captions in four languages figs 53 56 his prints almostinvariably carry an imperial privilege and give the size for example 'med folo median folio and group number with another number in the top right-hand corner which gives the serial number of the print the words 'excud a. v. mean published in augusta vindelicorum that is augsburg the kaiserliche franziskische akademie was active between 1775 and 1779 despite its grand name this institution was no more than a publisher 's firm at least 520 different views wereissued with captions in two languages and the line josef carmine 1770- c.1830 both etched and published about 150 different views with captions in three languages other augsburg publishers started a lawsuit against this 'miserable charlatan who produced mediocre work and also spied on other publishers dominikusfietta active 1788-1807 both etched and published about 40 different views with captions in three languages he was one of remondini 's many agents the muitilingual captions of the augsburgpublishers promoted the international sale probably more successfully than those from paris london or bassano whereas they usually give the name of the publisher it is unusual to find the name of the designer or engraver a number of exampies are known of draughtsmen who had a long-termrelationship with augsburg publishers the first is the german f. b. werner 1690-1776 who travelled throughout europe between 1727 and 1736 and drew profiles of townsand buildings for augsburg publishers the fact that he worked for several publisbers at the same time cut down the cost 29 according to ms. angelika marsch who studied werner extensively he made sketches during the daytime and reworked these into drawings the size of the final print he did this either at night at the inn he stayed in or in his workshop during the winter when he was not travelling a second draughtsman mentionedon views issued by probst is isaac van haastert 1753-1834 from delft three drawings in therijksmuseum print room for which the artist and the purpose werenot previousiy known can be recognized as preparatory drawings forperspective views the first drawing fig 54 shows the southend of delft on the right the rotterdam gate and in the middlethe schiedam gate.30 the second drawing fig 55 shows the weaponwarehouse magazijn de geer on the geer canal thisbuilding is also visible on the first drawing to the left of thebridge the third drawing not reproduced here shows the 'haguegate on the road to the hague these three drawings clearlyconstitute a series each sheet roughly the same size 300 x 400mm has been folded in the same manner and bears the samewatermark the titles form a characteristic feature because theyare repeated at the bottom centre and at the top centre wordedslightly differently on the bottom right- hand side are themonograms jchi and achi whose meaning has not yet been determined.a perspective view publisbed by probst fig 56 is clearly basedon the second drawing the lettering on the print identifies thedraughtsman as isaac van haastert a local delft artist accordingto the documents of the st luke 's guild he was one of the fewprofessional artists at the time and was chief hooftman of theguild for a period around 1790 the manuals state that he painted etched and engraved townscapes and village views and laterlandscapes as well his work can be seen in the municipal archiveand in the municipal museum 'het prinsenhof in delft the drawingswere clearly not meant as finished works of art in the first fig.54 the artist has redrawn the horses and the skies have been leftblank they give a sterile traced impression van haastert didindeed trace over his black crayon outlines with pen and ink buteven these crayon lines have little of the character of a sketch.the architecture has been executed schematically withouthesitation or shakiness of line all three drawings have been givena somewhat exaggerated perspective by stressing the orthogonals.because the first drawing shows buildings frontally van haasterthad to perform some tricks by choosing a wide angle and addingperspective elements to the quay ships and position of the masts he succeeded in obtaining an illusion of depth lt is notable thatsimilar distortions were also added by the engraver comparison offigures 55 and 56 shows how he emphasized elements at both sides ofthe composition so as to stress the perspective furthermore so asto simplify the appearance of the building van haastert left outone entire floor of the warehouse the connection between vanhaastert and probst was of some significance many other views ofdelft and other nearby towns such as the hague and schiedampublished by probst bear his name as draughtsman they alsocollaborated in a series of smaller sized topographical prints of amore artistic nature in this series the buildings outlines areless important and textures have been depicted perspective views produced in thenetherlands outside augsburg in the hague an isolated series ofperspective views was produced by hendrik scheurleer 1734-1768 .he etched and issued a series of 30 views of the hague and nearbytowns in the regular size of a perspective view his technique istopographically reliable hut artistically somewhat awkward one ofscheurleer 's copper plates a view of the royal house in thewoods in the hague found its way to the publisher robert sayerin london sayer then erased scheurleer 's name and replaced it withhis own as was the normal procedure at the time impressions ofboth versions can be found in the rijksmuseum print room thedecline in popularity of the perspective view between 1790 and 1850is difficult to explain but stereoscopic photographs whichappeared on the market after circa 1850 entirely supersededperspective views because of their
