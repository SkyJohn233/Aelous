Rubbish bags with cat litter are 'too heavy' | Gazette Colchester 7Â°c heavy bin bag   REFUSE collectors have refused to pick up black bags...because they are too heavy.   Danny Francis said for the second time his black bin bags have not been collected.   A note left on two out of three bags from the council says the reason was because the bags were too heavy.   Mr Francis, of Gilberd Road, Colchester, said the bags were weighty because they contained cat litter.   He added:  We recycle as much as we can and what can t be recycled goes in the black bags for normal bin collection. The council website does not state any maximum weight.   His weighed his bags after coming home from work to find two of them still in the garden, which were between 11kg and 17kg each.   He added:  I wondered how they were too heavy as my wife was able to lift them. Three bags have now been left to fester and create a health hazard, subsequently I have had to dispose of these bags myself. Despite contacting the council on two occasions, still nothing has been done. The extra weight is due to the amount of cat litter we have to use for one of our cats who is seriously ill and uses the litter more frequently. The council website states it is fine to dispose of cat litter in black bags, yet they refuse to take them. We try to spread the weight between the bags. If my wife can t lift the bags then we reduce the weight.   A  Colchester Council  spokesman said there was not a weight limit but added it is more of a health and safety issue.   He said:  Whilst cat litter is not recyclable and should go in black bags, our advice remains to pet owners to please remember our collection crews  backs and try not to make each bag too heavy. Given the sheer volume of waste material they encounter, with crews on a black bag route lifting around 100,000kg each day, our operatives are instructed, as a matter of safety, not to handle items which they consider too heavy to throw into the back of a refuse lorry. We will be happy to return to collect the waste if the resident can reduce the weight of each bag.
