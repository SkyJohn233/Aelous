" You have no right "  Part 2 (San Joaquin Valley Transparency) : AmIFreeToGo " You &# x27;re being live streamed, so don &# x27;t act up. "  I kinda like that line. The 30 seconds of pissing sounds really motivated me to keep watching! Great addition! Getting rid of that awful sound effect in the beginning of the video and not suddenly repeating the entire encounter halfway through with another angle would do wonders in making this a great video. I don &# x27;t think that &# x27;s an effect. I think that &# x27;s an actual recording of him pissing. Which is gross and trashy. Part 1  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFlvOxQ1GxQ hopefully this guy follows through with public information requests for the call to the PD reporting this and any radio traffic regarding this encounter. also any dashcam/bodycam video and audio, those could very well pick something up before or after the encounter to shed more light on the officers intentions. after thats all said and done, file a complaint for an unlawful detention and try to get a lawyer to take the case. I &# x27;ll file the request, it &# x27;s my local town.  What &# x27;s the best way to go about it? Deleted.
