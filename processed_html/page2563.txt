Cemetery library - Libraries for Scenery - X-Plane.Org Forum Forgot your password? By gplv3 A small collection of objects representing 'grave furniture' and memorials packaged as a library. Typical of older European/British Commonwealth style cemeteries.  Objects can also be used and distributed separately.     I made these so I could include small rural cemeteries in my own personal scenery.  Doubt many will find a use for these but here they are anyway.     Mesh and texture source included.   Donated to the public domain.         You may only provide a review once you have downloaded the file.
