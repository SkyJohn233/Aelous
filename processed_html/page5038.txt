LBRY Credits (LBC) price, charts, market cap, and other metrics | CoinMarketCap Chart context menu LBRY describes itself as an open source, decentralized, and community-driven digital content marketplace (think BitTorrent + Bitcoin) that enables the discovery, distribution, and payment of digital content. LBRY was launched in June 2016 with a working protocol and end-user product, the LBRY app, which is used to watch videos, publish content, earn rewards, and manage one &# x27;s wallet. As of March 2019, the LBRY network reportedly has over 800K pieces of content published such as movies, videos, images, games, documents.  This reportedly includes content from YouTubers ( https://lbry.com/youtubers ) a movie studio publishing films like Howl ( https://open.lbry.com/howl ), starring James Franco, and  &# x27;It &# x27;s a Disaster &# x27; (  https://open.lbry.com/itsadisaster ), starring David Cross. LBRY utilizes a rewards program to incentivize app users and publishers by allowing them to earn LBC for completing tasks within the apps, both as new users and on a recurring basis (i.e. watching weekly featured content).  The LBRY blockchain aims to provide a global namespace and database of content available on the network including searchable content metadata, signed publisher identities, rights, and access rules. Included in the metadata is a pointer to a decentralized data network like BitTorrent. It also provides publisher identities, human-friendly URLs (e.g. lbry://@MinutePhysics/magnetic-levitation), and a payment mechanism.
