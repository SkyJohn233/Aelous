I'm using blueprintjs's table to populate data and want some method to be called on double-clicking the table row. Is there any way to achieve it? Thanks I achieved this by setting  interactive={true}  on the  Cell  and then wrapping the cell contents in a div with the double click event: you can additionally bind double click event on row.in javascript: use syntax in jquery: there is indeed a browser "dblclick" event the Table does not currently support this. follow along at  https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/issues/1087                                 Click here to upload your image                                 (max 2 MiB) Cancel and add another image You can also provide a  link from the web .
