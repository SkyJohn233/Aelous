Transformative: ESS AMT-1 | silverfacestereo Just in   a pair of ESS AMT-1s. These look to be very early specimens, likel early 1970s. These are ported, unlike later versions with passive radiators. They are in great condition and everything works. I just started demoing them and am not finding a lot of bass. But the tweeter is really sweet. More to come.
