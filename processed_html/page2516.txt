She has gone from being one of the most reviled and demonised women in rock history to an iconic elder stateswoman of the peace and love generation.  Once she was demonised for breaking up the Beatles, then sentimentally admired as the widowed keeper of  John Lennon’s  flame. She has been portrayed as a cacophonic wailer hanging on the coat tails of her famous husband and a daring and original avant garde artist bravely carving out her own space in the face of racist and misogynistic abuse. At the age of 85, the public seems to have come around to a slightly reluctant affection for her enduring eccentricity without quite warming to her actual artistry. She is still widely viewed as half of a couple, even though she was a celebrated artist before she ever met the late, lamented  Beatle  and has continued to create new work in the four decades since his untimely death. And she has always been a less equal half. It is always John and Yoko, never the other way around. There are reasons for this, though, which are not necessarily as sinister as Ono’s admirers might have us believe. An audacious, original artist in her own right, Ono was awkwardly thrust from the experimental margins into the mainstream spotlight by her romance with a rock star. She essentially became world famous not for her own work but for its influence on another artist. O n Saturday, Channel 4 will broadcast a new documentary John and Yoko: Above Us Only Sky. Based around the creation of Lennon’s classic 1971 album Imagine, it features footage of the couple on at work and play at their palatial 72 acre Ascot home, Tittenhurst Park. If you haven’t seen this footage before, it is sweet and intimate and, in many respects astonishing: a close-up portrait of two iconic figures at work and play. W e see Lennon making music with Ono sitting by his side, whispering opinions. We follow them into bedroom and bathroom. They are shown at a David Bailey photo session, where Lennon gropes his wife’s breasts, and around a breakfast table with George Harrison, slurping tea and discussing the day’s recording plans. While most of the footage has been previously seen in documentaries and promotional movies, it nevertheless combines to create a fascinating snap-shot of a moment when Lennon really emerged from the shadow of the Beatles to shape a new solo identity. What is clear from the documentary, if anyone was still in any doubt, was what a profound influence Ono’s optimistic, provocative, mischievous approach to art actually had on Lennon. It helped shape a simpler, more direct form of lyrical expression, fuelled him with greater political commitment and pushed him into edgier musical and artistic positions. T heirs was a genuine collaboration. The language of the song Imagine, is all drawn from Ono’s art, particularly her 1964 book of conceptual poetry Grapefruit. “I wasn’t man enough to let her have credit for it,” Lennon later confessed. “The song expresses what I learned through being with Yoko. It should have really said Lennon/Ono.” T hat the public have struggled to accept John and Yoko as equal creative partners, though, perhaps has less to do with racism and misogyny (pernicious though those forces have been) than the fact that they occupied entirely different strata of the creative world. It is certainly true that Ono was collaborating with jazz virtuoso Ornette Coleman back in 1961, when The Beatles were still a Hamburg covers band. She didn’t actually sing, though, just set paintings on fire and cut up her clothes. Lennon brought Ono into his music world by recording and producing her music, whilst she drafted him into conceptual art collaborating on their public bed-ins and bag-ins. But while Ono was an interesting artist in her field, Lennon was a leading artist in his, and they were actually completely different fields. In a reverse scenario, it would be a bit like Picasso falling in love with an obscure songwriter and announcing that all future exhibitions would feature them both painting and singing. More people will always be interested in pop music (a form whose core impulse is commercial) than will ever be devoted to experimental art (a form that inherently challenges mainstream assumptions). Ono has made some interesting music over the years, her art-meets-dance sonic adventures finding occasional favour with leftfield and club audiences (although it is usually unrecognisable remixes that rise to the surface). I t shows a certain kind of boldness that Ono’s inability to hold a tune or play an instrument was deemed no hindrance to her doing both on recordings with one of the most talented and popular musicians the world had ever seen. I t is little wonder, really, that the general public has always struggled to make sense of Ono. She was foisted upon the world, in a medium not her own. Lennon fans may well have come to recognise and admire Ono’s profound influence on his work. But I doubt there has ever been any greater desire to hear her caterwauling on his records than to see him scribbling silly little cartoons at her art exhibitions. Let’s be honest here. Nobody bought their joint 1980 album for the Yoko Ono songs. The John and Yoko documentary, though, is another reminder that they really didn’t care what the rest of the world thought. They were each others' biggest fans, lost in their own world of creativity. And it is that dogged pursuit of a shared vision, in the long run, that seems to have earned Ono the respect and admiration that really is her due.
