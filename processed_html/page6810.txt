Independent candidate Andy Flynn, from Great Barr, is one of four men battling to become the region’s police commissioner in the May 5 elections. But his rivals say they have been stunned by his posts on Israel and Muslims, and his view that the police force is riddled with corruption and packed with “self-serving freemasons”. On his Facebook page, he has also shared images from others of German chancellor Angela Merkel dressed in a Nazi-style uniform. In one post, he claims Islamic terror attacks, such those in Paris and Brussels, are organised by Israel. He states: “Israel is the sworn enemy of Islam, yet there are no ISIS attacks on Israel, and Israel has a history of staging terrorist attacks to incite hatred between Christians and Muslims.” He also asks: “Was Marxism invented by a Jew to destroy Western society?” On his official website, he also attacks rivals for failing to deal with corruption and asks: “Is it any wonder our police service is awash with criminals?” Another post he shared stated: “Boycott Moslem take aways. You don’t know what they are doing to your food.” Many of the controversial posts were deleted after being highlighted by rivals, but have been seen by the Birmingham Mail. Labour candidate  David Jamieson , a former Government minister, said: “Flynn’s views are revolting. In more than 45 years of public life I can’t recall ever seeing such hateful things written by a candidate standing for election. “There doesn’t appear to be a group of people he has left out from his hate. The people of the West Midlands have far too much sense and will see through him for what he is.” Conservative  Les Jones , a Dudley councillor, said he has met with a cross-section of West Midlands communities on the campaign trail. “If we suggest we want to represent them, some of the views expressed by Mr Flynn make him unfit for public office,” he said. “I’m sure that during the course of the election people will see that.” Mr Flynn has paid the £5,000 deposit to secure the nomination. In a field of just four candidates, he could secure the five per cent vote needed to get his money back. Mr Flynn told the Birmingham Mail: “My views on Israel and its failure to cooperate with a UN investigation on war crimes and the genocide of Israel’s native people have nothing to do with my candidacy for West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner. “Any posts on my Facebook page are for my friends and family, and are therefore personal and not part of my election campaign. “I have not expressed any views about the German chancellor. However, my Facebook page is satirical as much as it is factual. “I do not belong to the political establishment, the very same establishment which has resided over Westminster corruption and Rochdale while challenging opponents on politically correct views. I have quoted Government figures that an estimated 2.5 per cent of serving police officers are involved in organised crime. “I also believe that serving police officers should not be members of secret clubs where the public cannot be assured that officers are not associating with criminals. Freemasonary is one of these such clubs. Several home secretaries have taken steps to identify freemasons who hold positions In the judiciary and police service for this very reason. “I have not made any comments about Muslim food, In fact, I often enjoy Asian food. My views on Marxism are not relevant to my standing for election. However, I do believe that Marxism and what it represents are a danger to our freedoms.”
