Angellist, SeedInvest and other angel investing â€¦ - Entrepreneur - Reddit If anyone has invested on those platforms, is there a material difference between startups who allow only accredited investors to invest in them vs those that allow both accredited and unaccredited investors? My personal worry is that startups that list themselves for unaccredited investors suffer from adverse selection problem: i.e. they are unable to raise funds with accredited investors and therefore have to offer themselves to  " the rest " . Can anyone with experience elaborate? Will be grateful for any useful insights. Startups that allow for unaccredited investors should suffer from an adverse selection problem because accepting unaccredited investors, without the proper disclosures in place, could unravel an entire deal. I &# x27;m not familiar with any platform that lets unaccredited investors in the USA take part in the offering. Do you mind telling me which ones are dumb enough to do that?
