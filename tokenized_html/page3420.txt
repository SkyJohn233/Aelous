dirt launches seasonal summer menu inspired by light fresh flavors and locally-sourced ingredients stay fit 305 select page posted by stay fit 305 may 27 2016 miami beach s fine food fast casual eatery and wellness bar dirt debuts a new menu with the warmer weather of the summer months in mind the menu is rooted in seasonality using many local ingredients to create light yet satisfying dishes filled with crisp refreshing flavors and vibrant colors one of the things i feel makes us different is that although we are a healthy restaurant we are all about flavor first when i create the dishes for the menu i think first about what ingredients are in season and use as many vegetables as possible then i think about what those ingredients pair well with and finally i choose the highest quality sustainable products i can source says executive chef nicole votano creator of the new summer menu at dirt i am very excited about our new seasonal options on this menu at dirt we love to showcase ingredients from local farms vendors and artisans i am particularly looking forward to shining a bright light on both jojo tea and harpke farms it was designed with efficiency in mind with the idea of staying true to our fine food fast roots says votano featured breakfast items on the new menu include the seasonal breakfast x harpke farms a collaboration between dirt and the local harpke family farms inspired by spring s bounty of green vegetables and mushrooms pasture-raised eggs are cooked over easy and served over your choice of quinoa or farro along with fresh peas asparagus local mushrooms and aged parmigiano reggiano guests who order the cult favorite avocado toast may gravitate to the new goat cheese english pea toast a thick slice of multigrain bread from zak the baker is grilled to perfection and topped with whipped goat cheese and lemon-scented peas then sprinkled with toasted pumpkin sunflower and hemp seeds the hazelnut chia seed parfait is a comforting and decadent option for breakfast or any time of day espresso- and hazelnut-scented greek yogurt is layered with a maple-chia seed pudding and topped with dried sicilian oranges toasted hazelnuts and cacao nibs to create a bite filled with familiar flavor and lots of texture the chimayo chili bowl is chef votano s all-vegetarian chili dish it s a hearty combination of onions peppers zucchini sweet potato and heirloom beans stewed with a blend of smoky spices thoughtfully sourced from la boite a custom spice blender based in new york the chili is served over a bed of bright green gluten-free bamboo rice topped with greek yogurt sharp cheddar jalapeno jack cheese and spring onions the seasonal plate is always a favorite at dirt and the spring plate does not disappoint crisp broccolini is grilled and tossed with a touch of lemon and chili flakes then served on the side of roasted red and yukon gold potatoes which are smashed with greek yogurt olive oil and fresh herbs the dish is offered with your choice of protein and garnished with more vegetables in the form of shaved carrots and radishes i m really enjoying the spring plate maybe even more than the autumn and winter plates it s hearty yet refreshing and it s the type of high-quality well-executed dish that you d expect at a sit-down restaurant in keeping with our goal to elevate the type of food that a counter-service restaurant can serve says co-founder and general manager jeff latulippe the berkeley beets sandwich or collard wrap is inspired by northern california with each bite you ll find another layer of complexity the bread is slathered with smashed avocado french feta and golden raisins then braised beets are layered with shaved fennel sliced cucumber and wild arugula finally all of the veggies are
