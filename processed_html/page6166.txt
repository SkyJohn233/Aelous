First Review by  JJones315 Points +1058                                                 I am a fan of the chain, but my experience here was disappointing. We waited 40 minutes for our order to be taken and get our food. My companion’s omelet arrived cold. The staff were overwhelmed though it was not even half full.                                              Pros:  Good vegan options, Great location  By submitting this post you agree to  HappyCow Terms Link to this page  from your site.
