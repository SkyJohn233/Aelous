Theresa May pulls out of This Morning last minute with no explanation | Metro News 135.6 m  shares Sorry, this video isn't available any more. Theresa May pulled out a scheduled appearance on  This Morning  just hours before the show today because, let’s face it, a sit down with Phillip Schofield and Rochelle Humes is right at the very bottom of her priorities right now. Phil told viewers he was ‘sorry to disappoint’, but the Prime Minister was otherwise engaged, which is fair enough as her own party are rallying against her in their droves and she’s expected to make an official announcement on the state of Brexit this afternoon. ‘We’ve been telling you to expect the Prime Minister on our sofa and we’re going to have to disappoint you,’ Phillip began, opening the show. Boris Johnson takes private jet to avoid 84 mile drive from Doncaster to Teesside ‘We were told this morning that all would become clear, it hasn’t yet. But obviously the reason she isn’t here today is to do with Brexit, and so she’s not able to be here but she has promised that the first sit down interview she’s going to do will be here.’ He continued: ‘She’s sent her apologies but she’s said hopefully next week she’ll be able to do the chat. So I assume during the course of today it will unfold as to why she’s not here.’ And viewers reacted accordingly: Oh I'm sure  @Theresa_May  will have PLENTY of time next week. But she won't be sat on your sofa as Prime Minister. You'll have to ask whoever's got the job….  #ThisMorning — Jeremy Skyrme (@DrSkyrme)  November 22, 2018 Eesh! That is bad that Theresa May backed out of appearing on  #ThisMorning  Blaming Brexit is a poor excuse. — Kim Carberry (@NorthumMam)  November 22, 2018 When you were waiting for Theresa May to explain herself on  #ThisMorning  then she doesn’t turn up  pic.twitter.com/EWxXQCGl5t — Estella Joyce ?
