advertisement baculovirus and insect cell expression protocols pp 447-459 cite as by use of a strategy incorporating the green fluorescent protein gfp facile and rapid monitoring and visualization of baculovirus infection in insect cells is possible in vivo this chapter describes two techniques for simple determination of virus titer in the baculovirus expression system using gfp co-expression and rapid monitoring of sf-9 insect cell infection using a combination of gfp and the early-to-late etl promoter of the virus vector because of its early appearance gfp when placed under the control of etl promoter will facilitate vector construction virus isolation and titer determination springer nature is developing a new tool to find and evaluate protocols learn more it is important to know the titer of a recombinant baculovirus stock expressed in plaque-forming units pfu/ml when preparing new virus stocks or when carrying out infections for protein production the productivity of the baculovirus expression vector system bevs is sensitive to cell density viability nutrient levels and the multiplicity of infection moi which is the ratio of added infectious virus particles to viable cells at the time of infection thus it is important to know both the viable cell concentration in the bioreactor and the infectious virus particle concentration in the virus stock with the virus titer and the viable cell number one can optimize production of the desired protein the viable cell number can be determined by hemacytometer counting using trypan blue staining 1 the titer of a recombinant baculovirus stock is commonly determined either by plaque assay 2 also see chapter 4 or by end-point dilution 1 also see chapter 10 other methods of titering a baculovirus stock are given in chapters 5 and 11 while the plaque assay has the potential to accurately determine the virus titer it is difficult to perform and requires a long processing time up to ~1 week furthermore visualizing plaques can be difficult while the end-point dilution method is easier to set up the results are often more difficult to interpret than plaque assays particularly when titrating recombinant virus stocks wild-type virus is easily detected because of the accumulation of its occlusion bodies but recombinant virus infection can sometimes be difficult to detect because of the lack of occlusion bodies to distinguish between infected and uninfected cells a decrease in cell density and an increase in cell size 3 are monitored with difficulty by regular light microscopy to enhance the existing titration methods alternative techniques for baculovirus titration have continued to emerge 4 5 6 7 8 9 one strategy incorporates heterologous reporter proteins for the detection and purification of proteins upon infection by baculovirus 10 11 12 13 14 15 for example sussman 12 introduced the bacterial e. coli β-galactosidase β-gal gene lacz into transfer vectors for enhancing assay efficacy and simplicity thereafter many commercially available transfer vectors contained this marker gene however the use of this marker requires an additional expensive substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside x-gal which must be added in an additional step near the end of the assay on the other hand fluorescent reporter proteins which can be easily observed upon chromophore excitation 16 17 are equally promising and simpler by incorporating the gene for a fluorescent protein e.g. green fluorescent protein gfp instead of lacz into the baculovirus a marker can be created for visualizing gene expression with no need for a substrate or other cofactors gfp one of the most popular fluorescence-based reporters used in biological and medical research 18 was originally isolated from the jellyfish aequorea victoria and was first described in 1962 19 gfp emits bright green light when simply exposed to ultraviolet uv or blue light unlike other bioluminescent reporters the emission of green light is due to the transfer of energy from the photoprotein aequorin to gfp 20 the cdna of gfp was cloned from aequorea victoria in 1992 21 gfp is a 238-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 27 kda 18 gfp has a major absorption peak at 395 nm and a minor peak at 470 nm with a single emission peak at 509 nm 18 gfp has several advantages such as species-independent fluorescence and unlike lacz it requires no substrate cofactor or additional proteins for detection unlike other reporters e.g. luciferase or fluorescence-tagged antibodies gfp does not necessarily require pretreatment prior to detection such as fixation techniques that are toxic to the cells under investigation 22 as such gfp has been widely used multiple reviews of gfp and its variants have appeared 16 23 24 25 see note 1 the bevs has been increasingly utilized for a variety of purposes ranging from gene therapy 26 to vaccine development 27 28 and also importantly as one of the primary platforms for recombinant protein production 29 that is the bevs is both effective and convenient for the overproduction of recombinant proteins in eukaryotic cells 30 31 32 33 34 the strong polyhedrin polh promoter 35 36 and the 10 kda fibrous polypeptide p10 promoter 33 37 are both active in the very late phase of virus infection and when used to drive heterologous protein production can result in the accumulation of over 50 of the total protein 38 also relatively recent metabolic engineering approaches to increase yield further have appeared such as those using rnai 39 40 41 although high protein productivity can be achieved with the use of late promoters polh or p10 these might not be ideal for probing the infection process due to the lag time between infection and polh-mediated protein synthesis 48 h post-infection early on crawford and miller 42 characterized the role of several early baculovirus genes on the expression of late viral genes and noted that the early-to-late etl promoter might advantageous for aiding the identification of occlusion-body negative recombinants via expression of β-galactosidase similarly richardson et al 13 demonstrated the use of early and late promoters including the etl promoter to facilitate the plaque assay hence an optimal system might utilize the etl promoter for monitoring infection 43 44 and the p10 or polh

recombinant virus stocks in sf-9 cells using hink s tnm-fh insect medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum in 25 cm 2 tissue-culture flasks at 27 °c grow sf-9 cells in sf900-ii sfm medium and subculture routinely every 3–4 days 1 count cell number using a hemacytometer determine cell viability by trypan blue exclusion using a 0.4 w/v solution dilute the virus stock samples serially 10 −4 10 −5 10 −6 10 −7 and 10 −8 by transferring 100 μl from the previous diluted sample into a new tube that has 900 μl fresh medium e.g. 100 μl of the 10 −4 sample into 900 μl fresh medium to obtain the 10 −5 sample each sample has an equal final volume of 900 μl except the 10 −8 dilution which has a final volume of 1000 μl harvest 3 × 10 6 sf-9 cells from the exponential growth phase and add fresh medium to obtain a total volume of 30 ml this will result in a cell density of 10 5 cells/ml mix 0.5 ml of each virus dilution step 1 with 4.5 ml of the sf-9 cell suspension step 2 to obtain a total volume of 5.0 ml gently mix pipet 100 μl of the virus/cell samples obtained in step 3 into 12 replicate wells of a 96-well plate for each virus dilution prepare a total of four plates for time course observation see note 6 incubate the plates obtained in step 4 at 27 °c for 4–7 days check each well for virus infection on a uv table green light which is due to gfp expression indicates virus infection and thus a positive well see note 7 calculate the titer pfu/ml of the recombinant baculovirus v gfpuv using the standard method described in chapter 10 see note 8 infect sf-9 cells during exponential growth ~10 6 cells/ml with a predetermined volume of the v p etl -gfpuv and v ph-gfpuv/cat recombinant baculoviruses to yield a multiplicity of infection moi of 5 see notes 9 and 10 and chapter 1 collect culture samples initially every 6 h for the first 60 h post-infection p.i and then every 12 h thereafter prepare whole cells from step 2 without medium by centrifugation and resuspend in pbs buffer quantify gfp using whole cell fractions in pbs buffer from step 3 by fluorescence spectrometry at an excitation wavelength of 395 nm and an emission wavelength of 509 nm examine gfp production from whole cell fractions via western blot as a function of time post-infection using samples collected in step 2 prepare a 1.5-mm thick 10 gel by mixing 7.5 ml of 4× separating buffer with 10 ml acrylamide/bis solution 12.5 ml water 100 μl ammonium persulfate solution and 20 μl temed pour the gel leaving space for a stacking gel and overlay with water-saturated isobutanol the gel should polymerize in about 30 min pour off the isobutanol and rinse the top of the gel twice with water prepare the stacking gel by mixing 2.5 ml of 4× stacking buffer with 1.3 ml acrylamide/bis solution 6.1 ml water 50 μl ammonium persulfate solution and 10 μl temed use about 0.5 ml of this to quickly rinse the top of the gel and then pour the stack and insert the comb the stacking gel should polymerize within 30 min prepare the running buffer by diluting 100 ml of the 4× running buffer with 400 ml water in a measuring cylinder cover with para-film and invert to mix once the stacking gel has set carefully remove the comb and use a 3-ml syringe fitted with a 22-gauge needle to wash the wells with running buffer add the running buffer to the upper and lower chambers of the gel unit and load 50 μl of each sample in a well include one well for prestained molecular weight markers complete the assembly of the gel unit and connect to a power supply the gel can be run either overnight at 50 v or if cooling is available for the gel unit then during the day about 5 h at 20 ma through the stacking gel and 30–40 ma through the separating gel electrophoretically transfer the samples that have been separated by sds-page onto supported nitrocellulose membranes see note 11 incubate the nitrocellulose in 50 ml blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature on a rocking platform discard the blocking buffer and rinse the membrane quickly prior to addition of a 1:1000 dilution of the anti-gfp antibody in ttbs/2 bsa for 1 h at room temperature on a rocking platform remove the primary antibody and wash the membrane three times for 5 min each with 50 ml ttbs prepare fresh secondary antibody for each experiment as 1:5000-fold dilution in blocking buffer and add to the membrane for 30 min at room temperature on a rocking platform discard the secondary antibody and wash the membrane six times for 10 min each with ttbs during the final wash warm 2 ml aliquots of each portion of the bcip/nbt reagent separately to room temperature after removing final wash from the blot add the bcip/nbt reagent to the blot western blot analyses of gfp expression under etl filled triangle and polh open square promoters a developed western blots b quantified results that were normalized to the first non-zero intensities from scanned images 12 h p.i. etl signal gfp fluorescence intensity for control filled circle and cultures infected with v p etl -gfpuv filled triangle and v ph-gfpuv/cat open square a fluorescence intensity over entire culture time b fluorescence intensity for first 48 h p.i in this research a gfp variant gfpuv which is optimized for uv excitation 22 can be used gfpuv is 18 times brighter than wild-type gfp and can be easily detected by the naked eye when excited with standard long-wave uv light e.g. source for many dna transilluminator light tables note that this variant is ideally suited for this work because there is a large difference between the optimal excitation and emission wavelengths and because its intrinsic brightness is so high also other gfp variants and fluorescent proteins e.g. egfp bfp yfp and cfp 16 23 24 25 could be used depending on the specific purposes or situations e.g. see luo et al 46 and yi et al 47 this is a neurotoxin when unpolymerized and so care should be taken to avoid exposure this strategy leaves the p10 promoter another strong baculovirus promoter available for the expression of genes of interest from the same virus successful co-transfection can be observed through green fluorescence using a fluorescence microscope this method has several advantages first this modified method is substantially faster than the normal end-point method this is an important advantage because we currently wait longer about 5–7 days for end-point dilution and 6–7 days for plaque assays for detecting infection second this method makes unambiguous the determination of positive infected wells that is the titer of recombinant baculovirus is obtained by simply placing the 96-well plate on the uv box and counting the green light emitting wells note that the gfpuv marker can also be applied to plaque assays for more easily visualizing plaques four plates are used so that results can be checked daily from day 4 to day 7 in the event that uv lights are to damage the cells and a given plate can only be read once although we have hypothesized that uv light may have a damaging effect on the cells we have not experienced such difficulty particularly because exposure time is routinely kept brief furthermore we can check the plates for infection each day during the 7-day incubation to test whether the results are dependent on incubation time we can check the infected wells by eye and count green light-emitting wells the orders of magnitude of calculated titer are the same 10 7 in all end-point dilution plates for each day furthermore the values are similar among all samples and within the standard error of the calculated average titer 5 × 10 7 pfu/ml finally there is no significant difference observed in plates read once and plates read three times on consecutive days after illumination on the uv table the intent of this experiment is to compare the infection of these two recombinant baculoviruses i.e. to compare the use of the etl promoter to that of the polyhedrin promoter effectiveness of baculovirus infection depends on cell culture conditions such as virus titer initial cell number initial cell viability and medium composition the colored molecular weight markers should be clearly visible on the membrane western blots indicate a clear shift of ~18 h for etl-driven expression in comparison to that expressed via the polh promoter the etl-driven gfp reaches a maximum at 50 h p.i. after which the accumulation level declines steadily the decrease is possibly due to proteolysis 48 and/or cell lysis following virus infection although the latter is less likely given the previously observed persistence of gfp from the very late polh vectors under the polh promoter gfp is detected at approximately 42 h p.i with a maximum at 96 h p.i followed by a sharp decrease these results correspond well to the expected profile where immediate-early and delayed-early genes are expressed between 0 and 10 h p.i. the transition to the late phase occurring between 10 and 15 h p.i. and the very late genes express after 18 h p.i 49 consistent with western blots the gfp fluorescence intensity under the polh promoter increases rapidly after 42 h p.i until reaching a maximum at ~96 h p.i. but without a marked decline under the early etl promoter gfp fluorescence remains low and fairly constant after 48 h p.i. but increases initially near 18 h p.i see inset in fig 2a resulting in a similar 18 h time shift observed by western analysis advertisement over 10 million scientific documents at your fingertips 2019
