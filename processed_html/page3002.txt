Europe Biopesticides Market By Origin , By Type , By Application, By Crop Type, By Formulation  &  Geography â€“ Forecast to 2020 | MicroMarketMonitor The biopesticides market in Europe is expected to grow from USD 833.5 million in 2015 to USD 2,117.6 million by 2020, at a CAGR of 20.5% from 2015 to 2020. Rise in the demand for organic products, easier residue management, and innovation in product line have fueled the growth of the market in the recent years. Consumers are have become more vigilant about the usage of harmful chemicals in food production. Agricultural produce with minimal or no chemical application is considered safer for environment and healthier for human consumption. Governments in various European countries, such as Denmark, Sweden, and The Netherlands have mandated for a 50% reduction in the usage of chemical pesticides. Biopesticides help farmers to maintain lower residue limits, as they decompose quickly and leave fewer residues on food and in the environment. Thus, substituting biopesticides with traditional chemical pesticides improves food safety. The excessive use of chemical pesticides disturbs the texture and physicochemical properties of soil, affects human health, and causes environment hazards. On the other hand, biopesticides are ecofriendly and easy-to-use biochemical pesticides that are made of naturally occurring substances that control pests through non-toxic mechanisms. Biopesticides are the key components of integrated pest management (IPM) programs and are receiving a lot of attention as a means to reduce the consumption of synthetic chemical products that are used to control plant diseases. In agriculture, biopesticides have many benefits in terms of quality and yield. Research and development is needed to develop effective application technologies so that productive biopesticides can be used by farmers.

Monsanto Company: Revenue Mix, 2015 (%) Figure 65 Dow Chemical Company: Revenue Mix, 2015 (%) Figure 66 BASF Se: Revenue Mix, 2015 (%) The increasing global population has led to rise in the demand for agriculture produce in the recent years. Thus has consequently resulted increased need to avoid crop yield losses due to pests and crop diseases. This can be achieved with the use of pesticides. However, the use of chemical pesticides has various health and environment related hazards. Therefore, there is a high demand for biopesticides in the market, with the rising awareness about these hazards among masses. Biopesticides are safer substitute for chemical pesticides, since they are less toxic, chemical-free, and easily decomposable. They are eco-friendly and easy-to-use biochemicals that are made of naturally occurring substances that control pests through non-toxic mechanisms. They are also the key components of integrated pest management (IPM) programs and are receiving a lot of attention as a means to reduce the consumption of synthetic chemical products. The biopesticides market in Europe was valued at USD 833.5 million in 2015 and is projected to reach USD 2,117.6 million by 2020, at a CAGR of 20.5% from 2015 to 2020. The market has grown exponentially in the last few years, and the trend is expected to continue in the coming years. Factors such environment friendliness, innovative production practices, new product offerings, and modernization of various agricultural practices are some of the factors that are expected to drive the growth of the market. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), biopesticides are classified into three major classes: microbial biopesticides, biochemical biopesticides, and plant incorporated protectants. Out of these, the microbial biopesticides are the most commonly used biopesticides. They are becoming more popular among growers, owing to their high efficiency at low cost. EUROPE BIOPESTICIDES MARKET: BY APPLICATION  The European biopesticides market is projected to witness significant growth in the coming years, due to factors, such as adverse effects on human health due excessive use of conventional chemical pesticides, governmental regulatory bodies actively participating in educating farmers about various eco-friendly techniques, and increasing concerns of consumers and pressure groups regarding safety of pesticide residue on food. The increasing concern for food safety has compelled producers to explore new and environmentally friendly methods to replace. The use of biopesticides has thus emerged as a promising alternative to chemical pesticides. Need for improved and more effective formulations, higher manufacturing costs compared to conventional agrochemicals, issues related to the registration for commercialization are some of the factors that may act as a challenge for the growth of the market.
