Novel plasmon-assisted absorption engineering based on layered metallic nanostructures: Materials Research Innovations: Vol 19, No sup4 Optical properties of the compound multilayer metallic nanostructures are investigated both numerically and theoretically. With the introduction of the trenches, the author reports the enhanced optical transmission (EOT) peak observed in the smooth multilayer metallic grating is completely suppressed and extraordinary optical absorption (EOA) is obtained, which is accompanied with a vortex-like resonance. To reveal the underlying physics of the switching from EOT to EOA, a semianalytical model is proposed based on the lateral and vertical plasmon coupling, which shows good agreement with the simulation results. Our study may provide an alternative way for steering the transmission and/or absorption properties of light, which might be of potential applications for thermal emitters, infrared imaging and detectors.
