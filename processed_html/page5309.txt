Lyrics i'll find you music song by michelle gayle Release date :  22/01/2010 Duration :  0:05:32 Style :  R /Soul I feel screaming, bleeding I see the ending Don't you worry You won't be alone I will be in eden with you When it all comes crashing down And it's winter all year around And the sky is firing And the world is Just a shelter underground When there's nothing left to lose And the lost cannot be found I'll find you I will bathe you Lay you in warm sheets Sing you to sleep And as the earth quakes And poison rivers run I will kiss all your tears away When it all comes crashing down And it's winter all year around And the sky is firing And the world is Just a shelter underground When there's nothing left to lose And the lost cannot be found I'll find you I'll find you When it all comes crashing down And it's winter all year around And the sky is firing And the world is Just a shelter underground When there's nothing left to lose And the lost cannot be found I'll find you I'll find you Michelle Gayle Michelle Gayle Mary Poppins Mary Poppins P-dro P-dro Mary Poppins Mary Poppins Zamdane B-nØm Alonzo 100blaze Mary Poppins Keen'v Major Lazer Jain Grégoire P-dro Benab Imany Kaaris Soprano Lyrics of the track  i'll find you  by michelle gayle.
