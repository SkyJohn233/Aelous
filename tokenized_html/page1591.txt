as he murderously glared at the other wizard his clothes were rumpled—his white shirt untucked and his tie hanging loosely by his neck—but he took no notice of them which seemed really odd for a man like him before he could open his mouth to inquire about the man 's state of delirium he was help up by the collar of the very furious slytherin your sperm is evil draco snarled pushing him to the nearest wall ginny heard the commotion from the kitchen and immediately joined her husband and draco in the foyer draco what are you doing her hand is on her hip while she looked at the situation with disinterest she had too much to accomplish besides stopping any fight between the two honestly it 's like they never grew out of their teenage years. draco hermione granger-malfoy ran inside the

visit they always got the best room i 've missed you you saw each other yesterday draco grumbled rolling his eyes then he looked at harry—to which the latter shrugged and mouthed women care to explain harry grumbled nervously he has been close friends with the slytherin to know never to mess up with the man hermione groaned crossing her arms across her chest she was still wearing her day clothes which consisted of a long flowy floral dress topped with her favorite red coat her bushy hair is in disarray meaning that she did n't have enough time to style it before following her husband to prevent any family tragedy on a wonderful day he knows the golden couple let out simultaneous ah 's since they seemed to understand the situation then realizing that draco still had him in the air harry gulped loudly i—it 's nice is n't it nice hermione has to lie if she says draco is n't turning her on at the very moment you call your hormonal spawn deflowering my daughter nice a nervous laugh erupted from the boy who lived d—did they do it though like is there any proof oh trust me i do n't need proof draco muttered darkly he has been a fifth year student in hogwarts once it was actually the time that the female population of hogwarts started calling him the 'slytherin sex god should n't you be glad that anya 's first boyfriend is james —my son that i raised quite magnificently might i add ginny placed her case you 've known the boy his whole life sweetheart is n't there a better boy for anya hermione jumped in the conversation hoping her voice would be enough for draco to be sane once more b—but they hate each other despite hanging three feet above the ground—curse his darn height—harry could sympathize with his best mate the boy who lived understood what draco was going through and would just dread to experience the same with lillian—his four-year-old daughter remember last christmas when james 'accidentally knocked over his drink spilling it all over anya 's white dress and the latter retaliating by throwing a bowl full of egg salad on his head ginny and hermione sighed he is analyzing this way too seriously yes but when they cleaned up whose shirt was your daughter wearing ginny raised an eyebrow she has been definitely spending too much time with narcissa malfoy fuck so they liked each other back then babe you threw paper planes all around our dormitory when you were trying to catch my attention at 7th grade when we were head boy and head girl a smile met his lips when his wife reminded him of the good old days well until he remembered that her revenge was enchanting his shampoo to turn his white locks into black any boy who spends as much time trying to catch a girl 's attention by driving her insane is a boy who is quite taken any girl who retaliates as soon as the boy does instead of ignoring him is…well there 's a very thin line between love and hate you of all people should know that uncle won awe uncle dwaco and daddy in love

mansion without any of the parents noticing a suspicious grin overtakes ron 's face obviously finding amusement with his three friends and sister what are you saying sweetheart he asked looking at harry 's daughter weirdly the girl has far to many questions for her own good this morning he almost tore his hair out because of her endless questions on why he and henry 's mother pansy do not live in the same house he ca n't just answer well my clueless niece there is a famous muggle phrase called a one night stand ginny would probably hex him into oblivion or worse tell mum and dad the little red-head swayed her skirts slightly before answering mommy 's always weading me stowies about how the pwince saves the pwincess and the pwince takes the pwincess in his awns and lifts her hiiiiiigh in

moment but how will they make a baby draco malfoy what have you been teaching our son hermione scandalized by her son 's too knowing tone in questioning glared at her husband in an attempt to save his own skin draco dropped harry on the floor leaving the latter to be bombarded with hugs and kisses by his daughter and nephew little henry follows on his chubby legs as he attempted to make a seesaw out of his uncle 's legs darling i educated him a bit early about the birds and the bees an eyebrow is raised by the muggle and without my consent mum dad you 're early they all turned their heads above the stairwell finding draco and hermione 's eldest daughter anya holding hands with a sheepish james she is the spitting image of her mother her brown curls are neatly piled on her head by a spelled hairgel her mother specifically brewed for her even her fashion sense came from hermione a perky pink blouse with a flowing floral skirt finished with her beloved brown clogs her brown doe eyes can easily bewitch someone with their innocence and superiority perhaps the only aspect that draco can proudly say he passed on her is her knack for pranks she was a nightmare to deal with after the summer she came back from the weasley 's manor uncle george is said to be her new idol james however takes after his father—excluding his bright brown eyes he is scorpius—hermione and draco 's eldest—best friend and has spent more time in the malfoy mansion instead of his actual home despite knowing that he is a nice fellow all draco could think about his how his son would write him letters about the school girls practically falling on their feet—one time someone even 'accidentally fell on james lap during dinner at the great hall what if anya comes home one day because she is heartbroken from watching the other girls flock around her boyfriend the boy shivered in fright when he caught sight of draco 's unwanted glare. hello potter jr. he tightened his hold on anya 's hand unknowingly good morning mr malfoy harry and ron rolled their eyes at draco 's triumphant expression sweetheart you 've always called him draco ginny met them at the bottom of the staircase giving each a big hug mr. malfoy is perfect actually draco interjects smirking when the boy 's stance wavered the smack delivered to his head said otherwise will you quit being such a sourpuss yes dear he mockingly agreed with his wife before she can even mention his name and the word 'couch in the same sentence what are you doing on the ground dad james finally let go of anya 's hand to help harry off the ground the small children were pouting in disappointment before bribed by their uncle ron for a piggyback ride harry adjusted his glasses and massaged his backside i have you to thank for that why do you— when he realized that draco was smirking he let out a long 'oh draco—mr malfoy can i please speak with you privately for a moment draco narrowed his eyes surprised by the request even more by the serious tone of the kid 's voice he placed a short kiss on anya 's forehead before nodding his head try not to hex him dad he only smirked at his daughter 's request they made their way inside harry 's study after the latter has given his permission what 's happened he heard ron ask. he knows his wife answered. aaaah weasley mused your son is a dead man walking harry the door locked with a click after them making all the welcoming noises coming from the foyer disappear after years of perfecting his poker face draco can intimidate anyone who negotiates with him james as it seems so was an exception after all who could take a man who helped him prank his parents and relatives seriously draco— mr. malfoy mr. malfoy i perfectly understand why you 're reacting in such a way he started we did keep the relationship a secret for six months six months he raised his hands in surrender after noticing draco advancing towards him it was anya 's idea i was all for shouting that she 's mine in front of everyone during family holidays—oops horrible thing to say anyway your daughter has always been a part of my life and i like to keep it that way— romantically speaking honestly i 've always harbored a bit of a crush on her when we were younger i know that you 're worried about the girls that scorpius keeps on writing about—please do n't be your daughter is twice the woman that they are i 'm very lucky to have her sir when they came out of the study unharmed everyone breathed a sigh of relief his daughter all but launched herself in his arms thanking him over and over again everyone congratulated the new couple—despite their knowledge of it hermione took it upon herself to get everyone ready before the guests started arriving and ginny rushed off to make some last minute preparations on the food ron volunteered to cast a heating spell on the outdoor pool so that the children would be occupied while the adults mingled scorpius lily and albus arrived a few minutes after draco and james talked and kept complaining how they missed all the much needed family drama after months without it in hogwarts a few hours later everyone is dressed to impress and the potter mansion is filled with the magical atmosphere of a family holiday blaze zabini and theodore nott draco 's best mates aside from harry and ron were with their wives luna lovegood and amanda fox who would have thought the another pureblood would also end up marrying a muggle with no knowledge of magic until their engagement night neville longbottom is with parvati and he has grown into quite the handsome bloke narcissa and molly are the duo that surprised them all their love for housekeeping and doting on their grandchildren is a forced to be reckoned with draco 's mother is often seen with molly weasley having tea in a posh wizard restaurant in london the night went off without a hitch—except for the part where george decided to honor his former twin by spiking the punch with a laughing potion they almost had to pry molly and narcissa off each other as they discussed on how they could have made the party better with more decorations ginny fumed and casted a spell to put them in sleep—not before casting an immobulus charm on george herself poor bloke he will wake up with no memory on why he 's floating in the middle of the pool using lillian 's large inflatable ducky the two women were in bed before the clock even struck midnight no one ever thought that they would be having a barbeque tradition with draco and narcissa malfoy or that hermione and ron did not end up together anyway they 're all glad of the outcome of the events after their final year at hogwarts they can almost feel the ghosts of the past smiling at the joyous future resulted from their sacrifice
