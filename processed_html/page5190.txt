Sober Times - Home | Facebook 4.9 out of 5 stars. Poppy seeds....yeah that ' s it.  # SoberBro  What ' s the best excuse you ' ve ever heard? Comment below. ðŸ˜” 13 days ago this box was a 23 year old person that couldnâ€™t breathe on his own, that couldnâ€™t think, that couldnâ€™t move. 9 days before that this box was a broke ... n human being. A person that couldnâ€™t get away from himself, a person that couldnâ€™t stop getting high no matter the cost. This kid was a son, a brother, an uncle, a father, a friend. 22 days ago he had the potential to become something better. He could have made it if he didnâ€™t use just that one last time. This box is my little brother. Whoever that is reading this, if youâ€™re still out there in pain and using, know that there is a way out. Donâ€™t let your mom be by your hospital bed crying wondering why her son is dead, donâ€™t let your children grow up without a parent, donâ€™t let your friends or family wonder what more they could have done to help you.
