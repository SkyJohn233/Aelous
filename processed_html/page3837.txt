The strengths that made Tiger I a formidable tank   were its outstanding armor protection and powerful tank killing capability.   Mounted with a superb 88mm gun, the Tiger I was capable to destroy enemy tanks   up to 2000 meters accurately. With its 100mm extra thick armor at the front   hull, the Tiger I was allowed to engage enemy tanks even on closer ranges without   taking too much damage itself. In fear of the superior power of the Tiger I,   no allied tanks dared to engage it in open combat, which was otherwise known   as  " Tigerphobia " .
