Princess Safari / Birthday "Safari Princess Birthday Party" | Catch My Party Selected as Party of the Day on September 25th!         By  A Dazzle Day in  Birthday A dream like birthday party for my dearest first year old Mia. This is the second birthday party I have planned this year and I just love it! Sponsored by Tania ( https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/taniasdesignstudio ), Tania designed the Mod Safari Girl Collection printable birthday party package for Mia and they are just adorable! I spiced them up with color streamer, crepe paper, lace, ribbon, etc. I designed and handmade her felt birthday cone hat, highchair decoration, favorite bags, photo frames, little felt animals, tutus, necklaces, headband, finger print canvas, cake topper, etc. I also made the elephant and giraffe cookies, macarons, and cake pops. Cupcakes and cake were baked by Todd and decorated by me. I still can't believe the party is over! I am so glad every little detail was captured and preserved. Love it, love it, just love it!
