ham and pickle roll ups the sisters kitchen ~amanda~ a few years ago a good family friend brought these pickle cream cheese and ham rolls ups to our christmas party as an appetizer we were all so skeptical about them at first because they just seemed like such a weird combination of flavors but after one bite and then two and three and ten we quickly realized they were one of the best appetizers we d ever had and we were hooked i now make these all the time whenever we go to parties where we re supposed to bring an appetizer check out our appetizers page for other awesome appetizer ideas too i most recently made these over thanksgiving for an appetizer at conor s mom s house and they were gone within 5 minutes literally everybody just loves them and the great flavors the sweet and vinegar-y dill pickles are perfectly complemented by the cool and creamy cream cheese and the savory ham all three ingredients are unique and have totally different flavor profiles but go together so wonderfully you ll wonder why you ve never combined them before today i am making them for a holiday party we are going to this evening another reason these little roll ups are such a great thing to bring to parties there are only 3 ingredients and they are so easy to make first you place a piece of ham down and smother it with cream cheese the more the better in my opinion and it must be room temperature or it will not spread easily and tear the ham then you place the pickle on one end of the ham and roll it all up finally slice into ½ inch rounds and that s it so simple and so delicious and i guarantee everyone will eat them up enjoy your email address will not be published required fields are marked check us out on instagram •love each other love food •sisters •co natives •foodies •travel lovers thesisterskitch
