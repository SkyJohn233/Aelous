This surveillance HDD is ideal if you are looking to upgrade your existing hard drive or add an additional hard drive to your system. It can reliably save days, weeks, even months of HD security footage. Designed for use with either DVR or NVR security systems. SPECIFICATIONS Maximum storage capacity Designed for constant operation Records up to 32HD individual cameras Works with both analog and digital systems You need reliability and performance in your security system. This means you need a hard drive that can handle the high workload demands of 24/7 security monitoring. That's why Lorex offers WD Purple surveillance hard drives. These drives are built specifically for continuous security recording and can even continue to record as you stream live or previously recorded video.  Traditional desktop hard drives are not designed to run continuously. Your WD Purple surveillance hard drive, on the other hand, can run optimally 24/7. In fact, the average desktop or laptop hard drive has a workload rate of about 55TB/year. WD Purple Surveillance drives, conversely, have a workload rate of 180TB/year. This higher workload rate greatly increases the reliability of the hard drive, so that there is a much lower risk of hard drive failure or data loss. These drives also have a MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) of up to 1.5 million hours, which is much longer that the average desktop's hard drive. Western Digital's Purple drives feature AllFrame 4K  Technology. This technology is designed to minimize frame loss to ensure you don't miss a moment. It also improves ATA streaming, helps reduce errors, pixelation, and other video interruptions that can occur with a video recording system.    One of the common issues with recorders is noise caused by vibrations. WD Purple drives, however, use IntelliSeek  technology, which calculates the optimum seek speeds to keep ambient noise and vibrations at a minimum.  This not only prolongs the life span of the hard drive but also helps minimize the power consumption of your NVR or DVR.   Most hard drive's within Lorex recorders can be upgraded after purchase. Some recorders even have two separate hard drive bays for additional storage. Please see the chart below to see the maximum available storage space for each NVR and DVR models.

Only thing that was easy about the system. 3 out of 29 on Location: Oregon Installation was simple, the entire system came back up when power was reestablished. I formatted the drive and everything functions as expected. 4 out of 29 on Location: Exton, PA Hard Disk of my original DVR that I purchased in 2014 went bad a month ago. I was exploring options to replace the DVR itself but calling customer service i was advised to get both hard drive and DVR to check it out. I decided to replace the hard drive first and it turned out pretty easy to replace, there were just 4 screws to unscrew and two cables to take out. It was that easy, the only slight challenge I had was to figure out where the screws were and after looking around the DVR box, I figured out they are at the bottom. Lorex has generous return policy as they were accepting returns in 60 days and included return return shipping.  ><br >It has been couple weeks and hard disk seems to be working just fine. Hope it lasts longer than my original one. By the way, the disks are available at other retailers too so if you want to go for price comparison make sure that you are buying a conpatible surveillance hard disk and not the ones that go in computers.  5 out of 29 on Location: Illinois Installation was easy. A high quality properly sized Phillips screwdriver makes taking the cover off the NVR easy. > After I opened the HDD package I noticed there were no mounting screws and no SATA cable. Since I was adding a hard drive this became an issue. I swapped out the old drive with the new,formatted it and away we went. Works just fine and I am pleased. <br >A ticket submission via email landed me a case number. I followed up with a phone call and found out that it was errant for me to think SCREWS  &  SATA Cable come with the hard drive. IN FACT THEY DO NOT. I was informed these accessories are available for purchase at Costco, Home Depot and Best Buy. A note on the website product description would be nice. 6 out of 29 on Location: Kansas Very easy to install. had some issues, but Tech Support was great and all issues have been resolved. If you are looking to upgrade an existing DVR for more storage this is definitely the way to go.  7 out of 29 on Location: Arizona The assistance process of diagnosing that the hard drive was bad was excellent. I got a rapid response to my question on what was the largest (went from 1 terabyte to 4 terabyte) capacity hard drive I could install in the recording system. The only issue I had was the written directions I received for resetting the hard drive as a troubleshooting procedure differed from the directions in the unit ' s manual for replacing the hard drive. I opted to follow the replacement procedure found in the manual and the recording unit started normally, formatted hard drive per instructions and the parameters for recording were inputted with no issues. Tested that each camera activated the recorder when motion occurred for the area that each covers. As a non-technical senior citizen I can honestly say that if an individual can use a screw driver and follow written instruction the process is quick and easy.        8 out of 29 on Location: ks easy to install 9 out of 29 on Location: Wisconsin My experience with Lorex products and support has been top notch.   I ' ve had a Lorex 8 channel system about 6 years and have been very pleased with the performance.   The system has already proven to be a smart investment.   A neighbor ' s car was stolen and my system captured the thief on video.   Detectives have used a copy of the video for further investigating.  This convince a family member to purchased their own Lorex system.  Each time that I ' ve contacted tech support with any questions or troubleshooting they have been professional.    My DVR recently failed and Lorex was quick to offer a replacement at a very reasonable reduced price since my unit was out of warranty.   I ' ve decided to upgrade my 2 terabyte hard drive with a 4 terabyte drive for additional recorded time.   Documentation from the DVR manual assisted with the easy installation of the upgraded 4 terabyte hard drive.   Now I can take longer vacations and feel comfortable the Lorex system has enough recording time for capturing any odd activities around the house. 10 out of 29 on Location: San Jose Ca I had to replaced my 2TB with HDD4TB Installation was the easiest thing I have ever replaced , works real well so far had it about about 2 months, Tech support was very helpful detecting my problem had to replace my power pack as well.

Used the Live Chat Widget to get the installation instructions. Installing the drive was easy following instructions. FLIR Cloud on my smart phones did not work. Had to call support to get issue resolved. Support was excellent. Also began using a laptop cooling pad to keep unit cooler. No problems so far after one month. 14 out of 29 on Location: Austin Ordered this along with the included 2TB drive in a bundle system.  Arrived separately packaged, so prepare to install yourself.  I am familiar with doing so and so it wasn ' t a big deal, they included the hardware and cabling needed to install an additional drive.  It was recognized at boot and added to the system without any configuration, so that was nice.  Would have nice to have it already installed when the system shipped, but as long as you are comfortable opening up the system and installing the drive and connecting the two cables yourself, it isn ' t a big deal. 15 out of 29 on Location: VA Very easy to install an additional hard drive. Thanks 16 out of 29 on Location: Indiana Easy to install, great product, great price, lorex does eveything to help you if you have problems 17 out of 29 on Location:   California I received the 4 terabyte hard drive and it was easy to install and it is working great. I did not have any problems with the unit so far. 18 out of 29 on Location: Montreal Easy to install and configure 19 out of 29 on Location: California I installed my 4 TB as per the video and it didn ' t boot up.  Hard Drive is DOA.  I called support and they will send me out another one.  Can ' t seem to get any kind of acknowledgement on when the new one will ship.  Very unsatisfied. Morning John, ><br >We can see that an SAP number was created only a few days ago for your replacement drive. The drive should be shipped soon now that the holidays have passed.  ><br >Take care, 20 out of 29 on Location: New York Purchased this HD to augment the storage capability of the rather short capacity 3 TB hard drive that came with the NVR.  Installation was quite easy in spite of no install instructions being supplied with the drive.  Performance from the get go was very good and it did what it was supposed to do.  When the NVR was replaced under warranty, the transfer to the replacement NVR was easy.   However the new NVR only has room for two hard drives.  Next replacement HD will be the 6 TB size. ><br >Would recommend this drive! 21 out of 29 on Location: Western, MA Unfortunately I am unable to rate the performance of this hard drive as I cannot install it due to the missing items but I can tell you that they have the worse customer service I have ever experienced!  I was shocked when I received this hard drive as the packing job was pretty bad.  It was placed in a large box with very little packing material allowing it to bounce around inside this box.   ><br >In both cases I received two products missing very small items and they failed miserably!  I get it that from time to time items will be missing and have experienced this several times in my life but the difference is when you call other companies and tell them your issue they send out the needed items, no problem!  These folks just seem to create far more work for themselves by running you around in circles getting no where.  So by doing this and not sending me these items that may totaled less than five dollars in parts they have turned my $2,000.00 purchase into something that could have been an excellent experience into a nightmare!!!  Sad part is I read numerous complaints about how bad their customer service is and thought no way could it be that bad and yes way it is... Hi Chloe, ><br >I apologize about the experience you ' ve faced. When something like this occurs, our customer service department usually replaces it once proof is provided. Once again, I do apologize if this was not the case when you had contacted us. There has been a request to have someone from customer support contact you directly to resolve this immediately. 22 out of 29 on Location: Mesa It was worth the long wait for the 4TB replacement part. It was easy to install and format after reading the DVR manual instructions. It gives me the piece of mind to know that the video history will still be available from long vacations away from home. 23 out of 29 on Location: Toledo Ohio I ordered this additional hard drive to expand the capacity of my NVR. The installation was relatively self-explanatory, and did not require much time. The online instruction manual I downloaded was from an older model NVR, but gave me enough info figure it out. Start to finish, the installation process was approximately 15 minutes. 24 out of 29 on Location: CA  Definitely happy I bought this product. Only had 1TB before purchase. Fast shipping, easy to replace,  love the warranty. Price was reasonable to. Would definitely recommend. Lorex has also been great with any issues I ' ve had since I ' ve had the surveillance system. 25 out of 29 on Location: Toledo Ohio  I ordered an additional hard drive to expand the capacity of our NVR. The installation instructions are easy to follow and this was much more efficient solution vs. having an additional external hard drive. Lorex support was helpful in the decision making process. 26 out of 29 on Location: KS I ordered an additional hard drive to add to our NVR.  It was easy to add and now allows us to have about 11 days of continuous recordings instead of just 3. 27 out of 29 on Location: Findley Lake, NY This hard drive is VERY EASY to install.  I had no problems at all. I like recording continuous footage from my cameras so I needed a bigger hard drive. 28 out of 29 on Location: Washington, CT This hard drive literally was completely installed in 15 minutes.  I found a YouTube video of a guy installing the same drive in his Lorex system.  The screws and blue jumper are provided with the unit so all I had to do was unwrap everything, take the screws out of the back of the cabinet pop in the new hard drive and it was done.  >I bought this additional Hard Drive because the website said my NVR only came with 1TB.  I was happy to find I had a 2TB hard drive when I opened the unit up.  Would have been nice to know this upfront.....  < p>                  29 out of 29 on Location: Los Angeles, CA    USA I received this 2TB hard drive and it would not initialize when I installed it in my DVR and that made me an unhappy customer.  The inability to reach either customer or technical service via phone and slow inconclusive responses via the ticketing system, with no resolution in sight after six weeks has been very frustrating to say the least and now I am a completely dissatisfied customer.   ><br >I cannot understand how an “International” company cannot provide service and satisfaction to resolve such a simple issue as issuing a Return Authorization and subsequent refund for a $100 item against $600 merchandise I purchased.  I understand hardware equipment can fail but really, how does the human element of customer service fail in such a spectacular way? ? ? ><br >I give this hard drive a single star rating because that is the minimum score required to post a review. Our apologies for any difficulty you experienced. We have provided you with a return authorization.  LNR100 Compatibility Was wondering if this 4TB hard drive will fit in my LNR1141TC23B camera system with a LNR100 hard drive Yes, LNR1141TC23B supports up to  1 x 4TB hard drive.  4TB Hard Drive Manufacturer Was wondering if the 4TB hard drive you offer is the Western Digital WD40PURX, was looking for additional info on it This drive is made by Western Digital Size of hard drive How and why is the size of the drive limited? Anyway to improve the size?  Most of the models support a Max of 4TB Hard drive, it ' s a firmware limitation.  HDD4TB-D compatible with Lorex ECO4 960H? Is our Lorex ECO4 960H compatible with this HDD4TB-D?  No, the  ECO4 Series DVR  support a maximum of  2TB Hard drives.  I am purchasing the NR9163 system with 16 cameras total to be installed. Can you connect 2 4TB hard drives (total 11 TB with the NR 3TB hard drive included)? The NR9163 has only two hard drive bays, meaning that you can connect only 2 hard drives.
