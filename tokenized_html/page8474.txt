description of field test mode data apple community looks like no one s replied in a while to start the conversation again simply ask a new question hello does anyone know where i can find the complete description of all the individual data presented in field test mode on an iphone via dialing *3001 12345 yup i know what the basic decible strength means but looking to interpret all of the other details my goal is to find the ideal configuration for a cellular frequency booster/repeater directional antenna and am getting some odd readings so far the fact that i am in a mountain rural area and have scarce access to two competing cellular towers miles away complicates the task the field test mode data would help refine the direction of the consitantly strongest signal peace dr. z

notoriously flaky why not go the easy route and see if your carrier offers a femtocell at t offers one they call it a microcell for 150 works great no hassles just hook it up to your broadband internet and away you go apr 25 2013 11:32 am apr 25 2013 1:05 pm in response to kiltedtim in response to kiltedtim kiltedtim thanks for the suggestion i am indeed familiar with that technology but it wo n't work for my needs because of a variety of reasons the biggest detail is that i want to secure a backup internet connection for the unfortunately frequent times that my primary connection goes down i can access a verizon 4g tower but i have to climb ontop of a hill several yards from my home the repeater/booster route is the way to go and works out of the box but i just need to refine the connection a little better peace dr. z. apr 25 2013 1:05 pm jun 13 2013 6:28 pm in response to dr. z in response to dr. z this is partially why i really dislike forums one comes to ask a specific question hoping for specific answers only to have the discussion go in a completely different direction the original question unanswered i have the same question regarding field test mode does anyone have an explanation for the data and metrics jun 13 2013 6:28 pm jun 14 2013 8:13 am in response to shummm18 in response to shummm18 i started this post so i appreciate your question and sentiments it can be frustrating trying to get a valid answer out of any forum then again it can also be frustrating trying to solve an issue through apple or any other big company other times you actually learn more from forums unfortunately i have not discovered the answer to our question after several weeks i called apple and the person i spoke with stated that the field test mode was n't intended to be used by the general public so they had no documentation to support it with they had no suggestion for finding an answer to my question i called verizon but of course they just told me to call apple in a knee-jerk response i have posted queries to this question on a few other places online but still no response other than very basic information like what the decibel reading means as for why i am seeking this information in trying to fine tune a cellular repeater antenna well i am forced to just slowly do it via trial and error ha the only problem is that the antenna is on top of my two story home and i have been climbing a ladder allot as a retired firefighter this is no big deal for me but it would be nice to have the issue corrected more logically and accurately what works one day is less efficient the next and i can see in field test mode that i am bouncing between three cellular towers this is confusing as i am on the edge of civilization so only one tower should show up as the priority most likely i am not deciphering the data correctly which is the whole reason for our question more microchips than sense dr. z. jun 14 2013 8:13 am aug 18 2013 9:37 am in response to dr. z in response to dr. z. i have the same issue we live in a valley poorly covered by verizon or any other cell carrier we have no direct line-of-sight path to any cell tower and the nearest one is almost 5 miles away i 'm installing a yagi antenna on our roof and am in the process of trying to align it for optimal signal amplification using a uniden u4 booster here are some things i 've found out in the field test app the base id identifies the tower with which your device is communicating we talked to a helpful verizon tech support person who confirmed this cell phone rf like light is best served line-of-sight in the absence of line-of-sight access one has to work with reflections and refractions from the surrounding topography and trial and error is probably the best way to go getting to the mount of the yagi antenna here involves climbing a ladder to the roof and then a ladder on the roof to the mounting on a bough of a large oak tree not a huge task but proper alignment will involve a lot of up and down trips i 'm 72 years old and my wife gets very nervous when i 'm working up in a tree cellreception.com is your friend as far as locating towers i believe their data is crowdsourced since the major cell carriers do n't make the locations of their towers available to the public a useful technique is to identify likely towers on cellreception.com pin them on google earth where you can actually see them and draw a line between your location and the tower go to a location along this line closer to the tower where you can actually see it and check the base id if it matches what you see at your home location then you 've identified the tower which serves you carriers pass off signal between towers based on a number of criteria including traffic volume signal quality and even legal reasons related to coverage areas so it 's logical that your base id will change even when standing in the same place or be different depending on the time of day the tower that handles your traffic at any given time may not be the closest one a database correlating base ids with tower locations would be extremely useful but the carriers apparently keep this information very close to their chests the verizon tech support person to whom we talked was willing to look up individual base ids for us although the one we gave her was a 4-digit number which i would guess belonged to a verizon network extender in the neighborhood she could n't identify it aug 18 2013 9:37 am aug 18 2013 1:07 pm in response to lindsayfromleander in response to lindsayfromleander i 'm installing a yagi antenna on our roof make sure you get permission from your homeowners association first aug 18 2013 1:07 pm aug 18 2013 2:16 pm in response to ziatron in response to ziatron we do n't have a home owners association here that 's one of the reasons i live here ðŸ™‚ aug 18 2013 2:16 pm aug 18 2013 9:54 pm in response to lindsayfromleander in response to lindsayfromleander we do n't have a home owners association here so you can put an antenna on your roof without written permission from all neighbors that can see it approval from the architectural control committee environmental impact statement budget report schedule with work milestones and a final inspection from the hoa wow it must be great to live free ðŸ˜‰ aug 18 2013 9:54 pm aug 19 2013 7:35 am in response to ziatron in response to ziatron lol in the first place a yagi antenna for cell phone frequencies is rather small not more than 18 in long or so and encased in white plastic second our house ca n't be seen by any of our neighbors and even if you 're in our yard the antenna is n't really noticable since it 's in a tree trees interfere with cell reception but our house is in the middle of a grove of pretty big trees so we have to deal with that we live in a semi-rural area in central texas in the us without a single iota of archetectural control in our subdivision the only deed restriction on our property is that we ca n't raise pigs i 've been having some difficulty aligning the antenna we get very marginal cell signals from a lot of directions here and i have yet to find the proper direction to home in on the signal which gives us 1 bar on the phone when standing on our roof with the phone and no amplifier it 's not as simple as find the nearest cell tower and point the antenna toward it i wish i had a hand-held directional antenna which would interact directly with the phone so that i could stand on the roof and move it about to find the best signal direction in which to point the mounted yagi antenna any suggestions anyone aug 19 2013 7:35 am sep 23 2013 11:51 am in response to lindsayfromleander in response to lindsayfromleander update with another oddity i finally found the best installation configuration for my wilson dp pro cellular yagi antenna and amplifier combination honing in on the reflection of an antenna signal around a mountainside like others have mentioned it was completely via trial and error with numerous trips up/down a ladder there is some equipment on the market that would have made it easier but i did n't want to waste the money on a one-time use for the expensive tools regardless here are two of those options http //www.wilsonelectronics.com/store/display/228/79/rf-signal-detector http //www.zboost.com/yx-699.html as for another issue along this topic that has popped up the field test mode is showing odd readings after the upgrade to ios7 the main dbm strength reading rx agc0 often bounces back and forth between being much higher or lower than the numbered signal strength listed where the signal strength dots usually are i have a screenshot of as much as a -26 dbm difference it is almost as if the display in the upper left corner takes 30-60 seconds to catch up letting the phone sit still for a minute or more seems to sync the numbers to within +/- 5 dbm peace dr. z. sep 23 2013 11:51 am question q description of field test mode
