I really like it so far but one thing annoyed me a bit. When executing  sudo -s  which is one of my usual workflows, my shell reports: module: command not found The reason is simple: sudo dumps most of the users environment with some exceptions, due to  env_reset  in  /etc/sudoers , when spawning the new non-login shell. Specifically the last fact causes the trouble since Lmod is activated by sourcing the proper file on (login-)shell startup. In my case (following the Lmod docs) there is a soft link in /etc/profile.d pointing to /usr/share/lmod/lmod/init/profile. My first attempts to modify the  env_keep  list in  /etc/sudoers  didn t work, because the module command itself is set as a shell function which AFAIK cannot be handled by that list of kept variables. from the shell environment: BASH_FUNC_module%%=() { eval $($LMOD_CMD bash  $@ ); [ $? = 0 ]  & &  eval $(${LMOD_SETTARG_CMD:-:} -s sh) $ type module module is a function module () { eval $($LMOD_CMD bash  $@ ); [ $? = 0 ]  & &  eval $(${LMOD_SETTARG_CMD:-:} -s sh) } So I saw no other solution but adding the following code snippet to my  /etc/bash.bashrc This will test if there is a  LMOD_CMD  environment variable set. If not, it will source the proper file to activate Lmod. Feel free to post if there are better solution! Cheerio! Recently, I switched from Environment Modules to Lmod because of   reasons.

There are several drawbacks, but the most annoying one for me are the missing coloumn headlines. Therefore, I made this little alias and put it into my global  bash.bashrc  file: alias psgrep= ps u | head -n 1; ps aux | grep -v grep | grep This enables a  psgrep  command which can be used like grep (since that is exactly what it is). Maybe some of you know an even better way? Cheerio! When I want to find out specific process information, I usually use ps aux | grep PATTERN.
