april 2018 interstellar experiences of nasa interns interstellar experiences of nasa interns my name is esmarline de león peralta a future physician-scientist flight surgeon and astronaut i am determined to be part of a group of experts and professionals that will develop key technologies for travel to and living on mars furthermore i would like to assist in developing the systems necessary to support astronauts and communities adaptability and survival in the environment on mars as an aspiring physician i believe the advancements created as we continue to research what life could be like on mars could also impact global health by providing healthcare accessibility and point-of-care technologies for both developing countries and under-developed areas i began to appreciate the importance of engagement perseverance and empathy at a young age largely due to the lack of resources and opportunities in my home country the dominican republic i grew up in a house made of tin and wood where water and electricity were not always accessible and even my home was not accessible during hurricane season we moved to puerto rico when i was ten years old looking for better educational opportunities and a better life my mother was denied career opportunities in the field of systems and computer engineering because her degree was obtained in a foreign country learning about challenges and inequalities was hard at a young age but these experiences made me stronger and shaped me into an overachiever and passionate dreamer my journey to nasa has been one of the most inspiring challenges of my life my immigration status affected my nasa goals but gave me the courage and inspiration to prepare and become not only a u.s. permanent resident but an official citizen i am a 2014 nasa minority university research and education program murep scholar for which i give thanks to ms. elizabeth cartier at arc for her encouragement and constant support throughout these years my nasa interests along with my desire to address problems in health and understand how chemicals impact the biomedical engineering field made me choose a career in chemical engineering at the university of puerto rico-mayagüez since 2012 i have had experiences researching in biologically-inspired engineering labs at universities and hospitals such as harvard university massachusetts general hospital georgia institute of technology and ohio state university my interest in biomedical sciences and engineering encourages me to get a m.d.-ph.d. as a physician-scientist in bioastronautics my passion for biomedical devices using 3-d printing was amplified after researching at massachusetts general hospital when accepted at nasa i felt that my dreams had come true and i was home where i belonged i am currently a spring intern at nasa s ames research center in silicon valley i am working in the entry systems and vehicle development branch with dr. jing li developing ultra-light weight batteries using 3-d printing technology and nanotechnology this cutting-edge technology will enable new power and tools for space exploration and building human habitats in space during the summer of 2018 i will be interning at nasa s marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama i will be working with a 3-d printer identical to one currently in space the n-scrypt 3-d printer supporting 3-d multi-materials and process parameters for 3-d printing and helping in the fabrication of conductive inks to print small circuits under the mentorship and guidance of mr. curtis hill thank you nasa for being my dream my present and my future here is where i belong i can not be more grateful i have no words to express the happiness of my heart to represent minorities hispanics women in stem and the next generation of mars and beyond planets explorers god s faithfulness last forever psalm 100:5 ten years ago i never imagined where i would be at nasa s goddard space flight center graduating from high school in the far south suburbs of chicago i received my bachelor s degree in history taking film production classes along the way after spending a summer at an archaeology field school deciding what to pursue for graduate school i became aware and frustrated with the lack of educational factual engaging media in regards to history that led me to pursue a master of fine arts in science natural history filmmaking at montana state university in bozeman montana the science natural history filmmaking program at montana state university is the first program to offer a master s of fine arts in the area of science and natural history film students and alums work on various projects from blue chip films with bbc programming for national geographic independent films about environmental issues and videos for the national parks service nasa and more the mfa was founded to teach scientists how to make films in a response to watered down science and pseudo-science programming that became prevalent while attending montana state university i worked on a multitude of projects from a feature film to smaller documentaries on the wildlife of the greater-yellowstone ecosystem geology and more it was while working on a full-dome planetarium film about gravitational waves when i became interested in interning at nasa while working on the shoot i had the opportunity to visit goddard to film 360 video for the film einstein s gravity playlist where i met and learned about the projects that video producers at nasa work on working in videography at nasa has been a great experience with its own challenges that are rewarding when they are conquered it is hard to compare to other internships but doing videography is always interesting one day i might be interviewing an astronaut the next day i might be helping to broadcast interviews with scientists across the country and later that day working on the latest edit of a video we might be working on it s always exciting to see what each day brings one thing i would say to remember or point out with film as part of science communication is how important it is most people tend to only think of science communication as strictly journalism but there are so many more mediums to communicate through which is why i am drawn toward 360 video and virtual reality to explore how it can be used to communicate in a more immersive way while at nasa i had the opportunity to help with live shots in goddard s broadcast studio and recently finished a video piece for the hubble space telescope to celebrate some of the women who are connected to spacecraft while working on the film i met many inspiring women who carry the same message of perseverance paying off with only a month left i will be concentrating on 360 video content for goddard
