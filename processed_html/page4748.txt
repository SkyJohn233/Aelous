March 11, 2009 Toronto                                                                             Aerospace,                                                                         Press Release                                 Low Resolution (62 KB) High Resolution (183 KB) Bombardier announces new model names for game-changing aircraft Bombardier Aerospace announced today that Deutsche Lufthansa AG, the launch customer for the  CSeries  aircraft program, has signed a firm purchase agreement for 30  CSeries  model  CS100  (formerly  C110 ) single-aisle aircraft. These aircraft will be operated by Lufthansa s subsidiary Swiss International Air Lines Ltd. The agreement also includes options on an additional 30  CSeries  aircraft. Based on list price, the contract value for the 30  CS100  aircraft is approximately $1.53 billion US. The Lufthansa Group became the launch customer for the  CSeries  aircraft family in July 2008 when it signed a Letter of Interest (LOI) for up to 60 aircraft, including 30 options. Our purchase agreement with Bombardier for  CSeries  aircraft is a renewal of Lufthansa s commitment to commercial success balanced by environmental and business policies oriented toward sustainability and passenger comfort,  said Nico Buchholz, Senior Vice President, Corporate Fleet, Lufthansa.  We are proud to be the launch customer for the  CSeries  family of aircraft which meets our requirements for sustainable fleet development including significant reductions in fuel burn and noise, as well as offering flexibility for the future. Having Lufthansa - known throughout the airline industry for its stringent engineering and technical standards - sign this purchase agreement for our  CSeries  aircraft, confirms their confidence in the airplane and the future of the program,  said Gary R. Scott, President, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft.  We, at Bombardier, are delighted to have Lufthansa working with us from the beginning as we develop a family of aircraft designed specifically to meet the needs of the 100- to 149-seat market segment. Bombardier Aerospace also today announced the launch of new model designations for its game-changing  CSeries  family of aircraft. The 110-seat configuration (previously known as the  C110  aircraft) will be designated the  CSeries  model  CS100  aircraft and the 130-seat configuration (formerly the  C130  aircraft) will be designated the  CSeries  model  CS300  aircraft. The 110-seat and 130-seat  CSeries  family of aircraft brings unmatched passenger comfort, performance, and operating economics, benefiting from the latest technological advancements, including: fourth-generation aerodynamics; increased use of composites and advanced aluminium alloys in structures; the very latest in system technologies, such as fly-by-wire, electric brakes, and a next-generation engine   the Pratt &  Whitney PurePower TM  PW1000G  engine. PurePower TM represents a significant breakthrough in turbofan technology, especially on the environmental front where it will set new benchmarks from dramatically reduced fuel burn, noise, and emissions. At time of entry into service in 2013, the  CSeries  family of aircraft will be the greenest single-aisle aircraft in its class. These game-changing aircraft will emit 20* per cent less CO 2  and 50* per cent less NOx, fly four* times quieter, and deliver dramatic energy savings   20* per cent fuel burn advantage as well as 15* per cent improved cash operating costs versus current in-production aircraft of similar size. The  CSeries  aircraft will set a new benchmark in the industry, consuming as little as two litres of fuel per passenger per 100 kilometres in its more dense seating layouts*. The  CS100  and  CS300  aircraft models will share a new common centerline engine and have the same crew type rating, operating and maintenance procedures. Each of the aircraft models will also have operational flexibility to permit utilization on both short-haul and transcontinental routes. In addition to Bombardier s fourth-generation transonic composite wing design, the company is also using its Reconfigurable Engineering Flight Simulator II (REFS II) to develop customized  fly-by-wire  control laws specific to  CSeries  aircraft. This simulator is the first of many devices planned, as part of an extensive integrated test regime, to ensure the  CSeries  aircraft achieves consistently high levels of reliability when it enters service.
