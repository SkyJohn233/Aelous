I check in drupal log messages where i got log message "cURL error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate". My site is currently using drupal 7.21 with ubercart and payment method is credit card(including Authorize.net payment gateway). Currently Transaction mode is set "Developer test account transactions". SSL certificate has been properly installed. Give me some reply............? Moving to the correct queue. This is almost certainly a problem with your server's PHP installation, similar to  #1853672: Unable to process PayPal credit card payments on Windows . Your own site's SSL certificate has nothing to do with it. You can start by looking at phpinfo to confirm your server has SSL support built into PHP. Also try Google - there are numerous posts about this error message - it's a cURL/PHP problem, not an Ubercart problem. Agreed, this is an issue with the SSL certificates in your cURL installation. You need to get a CA cert bundle and install it on your server; see  http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html  for more information. Automatically closed -- issue fixed for 2 weeks with no activity. I'm also experiencing this error but it does it when processing credit card payments on the orders tab. The thing that I'm bothered is that when I tested interacting with Authorize.net without Drupal / Ubercart, there were no problems with the SSL at all. Any thoughts? This is an issue with the SSL certificates in your cURL installation. You need to get a CA cert bundle and install it on your server; see  http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html  for more information. Also, you should upgrade from 6.x-2.2 as it's extremely old and security updates and many bug fixes have been made since. I did install it but it still doesn't work. I don't know if I installed it correctly I just searched installing SSL certificates in Google and followed the steps. Anyway, I have the same error with Drupal 7. I was wondering if you could guide me to the right path by giving me some good tutorials or even just an orientation of the process on how to install these CA Cert bundles. Thanks. I guess you are on Windows - this only seem to occur for Windows users - but I'm afraid I don't use Windows so the only help I can give you is the link above. I am running Drupal 6.31 with Ubercart 6.x-2.13 and could not talk to my credit card processor with the SHA2 SSL certificates and the processor told me to set curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, 0) per this instruction  http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html  and now it works.  I don't think this is a long term solution and I am working to port to D7 anyway. Drupal is a  registered trademark  of  Dries Buytaert .
