Indian great Kapil Dev explains what makes captain Virat Kohli a special player | Cricket News Indian skipper Virat Kohli has been in sublime touch throughout 2018 notching up records both on foreign soil and on home turf. Despite other Indian batters performing poorly on the overseas soil in the series against South Africa and England, Kohli put up centuries and fifties and rewrote many records, before emulating the same against West Indies at home. Fans ergo are counting on him to replicate his performance in the impending Australia tour as well. And ahead of the series kick off, Indian cricketing legend explained the reason behind Kohli being such a special player. "I think he is a special person, a special player. Certain people are special and he is one of them. The people who have talent, and who are ready to work hard, I think they become a superstar or superhuman. So I think he is talented and disciplined and that makes him what he is," said the 1983 World Cup winning captain in conversation with  NDTV. Kohli notched up 286 runs which included a century in the three-match Test series against South Africa before he signed off England Test series with a whopping 593 runs at an average of 59.30 which included two centuries. Back home, he scored three back-to-back record-equalling ODI tons against West Indies. And now, Kohli is expected to carry his sublime form Down Under where he had recorded a massive 692 runs in a four-match Test series in 2014 despite India's 0-2 loss. Meanwhile, Kapil also weighed in on the importance of Mahendra Singh Dhoni to the Indian team. "I think whatever he has done, he's done a great job. But I think the bad part is we are expecting the same 20 or 25 years old Dhoni, which is not going to work," Kapil Dev said.
