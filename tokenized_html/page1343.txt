what would daily life be like under an sjw-influenced tribe general discussion mlp forums forgot your password by horsesandmoargaloar august 9 2014 for example if a group of sjws created a nomadic tribe of their own what is it like to live under such people as they would their way of life be similar to the amazons of greek legend or something worse how would their society religion government leisure families and diplomacy be like perhaps you could define what sjw stands for super jehovah witnesses a nomadic tribe that goes door to door leaving pamphlets silverhoof it stands for social justice warrior they 're basically self-righteous crusaders who end up making a mockery of themselves as well as the topics they rave about i would n't mind being in a group of super saiyan warriors in all seriousness i bet life would really suck for men if they were in a social justice warriors group filled with feminazis plus daily life would probably be full of hearing complains that society is n't like that society should be like this etc that sounds really aweful it would be like if communism and radical feminism had a very deformed and angry baby certainly not something any sane person would want to live under i imagine it would not last beyond a single generation because they would either excommunicate eviscerate or castrate all of their cis-gender heterosexual men who identify as male and thus sterilize their own clan preventing all possible genetic propagation of their influence edit how is this a debate-pit question i fail to see how tumblrian social justice warriors are as important as philosophy or current global affairs what would their daily activities be like how is life like for the female members like amazons what is their government like what would their daily activities be like how is life like for the female members like amazons what is their government like they would work in a democracy except it would be their version of a democracy whoever can yell the loudest and sound the most insane is the new smarty friend edit most hilarious pony-autocorrect change ever but what about their daily activities and daily life from sunrise to sunset/sleeping and what would their holidays and social customs be but what about their daily activities and daily life from sunrise to sunset/sleeping and what would their holidays and social customs be being angry about men and celebrating ovary day day to day would consist of playing video games and refusing to pay the electric bill because patriarchal hierarchies dictate the operating policies of most power-generating and transmission companies people eat whenever because meh fig.1 misogyny okay i 'm sorry but i have to ask is this really a debate thread or a space for people to be complete dicks to people they do n't agree with okay i 'm sorry but i have to ask is this really a debate thread or a space for people to be complete dicks to people they do n't agree with it is a debate thread it just so happens that a vast majority of people on said thread agree with each other back on the topic of the op 's question it would probably wind up collapsing on itself because at least what i 've seen from the radical side of social justice no one wants to do their own work beyond that they would never get anything done because the radfems would argue with the trans-supremacists about who is superior and everyone would fight each other the fact of the matter is sjws are a very vocal minority in the field of social justice there are sane people as well but they are shouted down insulted and drowned out by the frothing rabid morons that call themselves or are called sjws okay i 'm sorry but i have to ask is this really a debate thread or a space for people to be complete dicks to people they do n't agree with +1 by no means am i an sjw but come on now y'all got ta respect other people 's opinions you do n't have to agree with them but this here seems like your taunting the sleeping bull waiting for it to awake edit it may be a debate thread and it would be all fine and dandy if it were phrased differently but seriously a nomadic tribe etc is obviously well trolling +1 by no means am i an sjw but come on now y'all got ta respect other people 's opinions you do n't have to agree with them but this here seems like your taunting the sleeping bull waiting for it to awake yes i must respect someone 's opinion unless their opinion is 'kill all cis/het/white/men/demographic of choice then i have every right to point out how utterly ridiculous the person is it is a debate thread it just so happens that a vast majority of people on said thread agree with each other that 's not the problem the problem is that to be frank they 're being complete asses while they 're doing it you can disagree make your point and try to be nice about it we 're better than this guys yes i must respect someone 's opinion unless their opinion is 'kill all cis/het/white/men/demographic of choice then i have every right to point out how utterly ridiculous the person is then at least use a more reasonable approach to the topic then referencing nomadic tribes amazons and greek legend etc idk maybe something like how can we get across to these basically radicals that they are unnecessarily exaggerating and doing more than just reversing the negative stereotypes but actually causing ourselves to be seen in a negative light that would be a nicer approach that 's not the problem the problem is that to be frank they 're being complete asses while they 're doing it you can disagree make your point and try to be nice about it we 're better than this guys bingo then at least use a more reasonable approach to the topic then referencing nomadic tribes amazons and greek legend etc idk maybe something like how can we get across to these basically radicals that they are unnecessarily exaggerating and doing more than just reversing the negative stereotypes but actually causing ourselves to be seen in a negative light that would be a nicer approach i never did any of those things but i get your point as for trying to be nice i try my hardest to do so and i hate to say this but it 's literally like trying to talk with the laziest terrorists on the planet they are too blinded by their own hate to recognize that they are both in the minority and acting like children and they hide behind hashtag activism and claims of 'privilege and 'oppression whenever anyone says anything to question their dogma that 's not the problem the problem is that to be frank they 're being complete asses while they 're doing it you can disagree make your point and try to be nice about it we 're better than this guys yes you can but what 's the point when the other side is dismissing it as 'mansplaining or 'dudebros anyway in hindsight i was wrong this is not a debate thread even though it had the potential to be one this is a vent thread where people who are angry about a group go to be angry okay i 'm sorry but i have to ask is this really a debate thread or a space for people to be complete dicks to people they do n't agree with am i making myself clear now what will their main method s of sustenance be in such a cruel world agriculture hunting/fishing foraging or herding of animals remember this discussion is only meant to speculate on a possible nomadic tribe based on the swjs influence i also need help on what kinds of animals do they typically keep what are their cultural values where would they be most likely to settle on e.g riverbanks plains mountains forests plateaus etc and what kind of clothing will they wear it would probably result in a society where people can walk outside and not be attacked for who they are but please i really pity all the white straight men in this thread i 'm sorry minorities are bothering you with issues like basic human rights and respect hopefully we wo n't distract you from your video games for too long ^^ yes i must respect someone 's opinion unless their opinion is 'kill all cis/het/white/men/demographic of choice then i have every right to point out how utterly ridiculous the person is which literally no one says the kill all men hashtag was 4chan half those tumblrs you see are cherry picked screenshots or the same people over and over whatever youve seen on reddit or /pol/ or stormfront is either faked or chosen from a ridiculously small mintority of people which you also advocate except i 'm sure you slap sjw on whoever makes you feel bad the lgbt and feminist movements are constantly harmed by wannabes and moderates who are too comfortable in their position of power to admit they 're part of the larger problem it would probably result in a society where people can walk outside and not be attacked for who they are but please i really pity all the white straight men in this thread i 'm sorry minorities are bothering you with issues like basic human rights and respect hopefully we wo n't distract you from your video games for too long ^^ which literally no one says the kill all men hashtag was 4chan half those tumblrs you see are cherry picked

're part of the larger problem the nazi stalinist and apartheid movements were also constantly harmed by moderates who were too comfortable in their position of power maybe your problem is you refuse to acknowledge that there are just as many problems with everyone else as there are with you particularly because you are in the minority that can afford a computer and a broadband internet connection i 'm just going to leave these here these are some examples of crazy sjws from tumblr i got these screenshots from /r/tumblrinaction now what will their main method s of sustenance be in such a cruel world agriculture hunting/fishing foraging or herding of animals i also need help on what kinds of animals do they typically keep what are their cultural values where would they be most likely to settle on e.g riverbanks plains mountains forests plateaus etc and what kind of clothing will they wear please post answers like this e. g. they forage they rear horses and sheep they prefer independence they live near riverbanks etc can you answer my question i do n't want general answers like they are dumb they are this and that please stick to my questions and be specific this is a thread about a fictional tribe created by sjws not a debate thread i am only wondering what will life be like for this tribe without electronics or stuff fending for themselves in the wild am i making myself clear now what will their main method s of sustenance be in such a cruel world agriculture hunting/fishing foraging or herding of animals remember this discussion is only meant to speculate on a possible nomadic tribe based on the swjs influence i also need help on what kinds of animals do they typically keep what are their cultural values where would they be most likely to settle on e.g riverbanks plains mountains forests plateaus etc and what kind of clothing will they wear i apologize for offense taken at my earlier remarks in defense of my facetiousness the question of a tribe whose only concern is for the social justice of others elsewhere is a rather remote and possibly absurd hypothetical social justice only has meaning when it results in an impact and change i inferred tribe to mean a people remote from statehood or official matters of civilization and associated social issues by corollary the social justice concerns of a tribe would only concern those of within that or like-tribes i hardly think of any common internet denizen as a member of a tribe this is why i found the question in your thread topic absurd the social issues sjws seem to combat from their position on tumblr and elsewhere are largely external ones slander and prejudice on tumblr itself only extents as far as unfortunately commonplace cyber-bullying trolling and anonymous vigilantism usually do however when one raises exclamation marks over gay rights homosexual marriage gender non-conformity misogyny and so on these are almost always caused though actions in real life by real people quite far removed from the tumblr experience and by people in much higher authority or more interfaced into day-to-day-life-outside-of-computers than the average microblogger of course social problems might develop in a hypothetical tribe but that would entirely depend upon the initial emphasis that given tribe placed upon matters religious familial in concern of peace or war death and birth and many other things to simply ask a question as to how this given tribe might behave and postulate what-ifs in that direction is simply an imaginative exercise partially serviced by playing sid meier 's civilization v with the stone age tech mod such an imaginative exercise is why i did not think this was a matter that merited a debate pit thread a tribe of social justice warriors could not combat modern social injustice if they were removed from society in the way that tribes are if you wanted to know how a tribe of jimmies-rustled tumblr-users would survive i already answered that not very well and not for long the nazi stalinist and apartheid movements were also constantly harmed by moderates who were too comfortable in their position of power maybe your problem is you refuse to acknowledge that there are just as many problems with everyone else as there are with you particularly because you are in the minority that can afford a computer and a broadband internet connection please you ca n't compare a movement seeking to liberate minorities to those who seek to enslave or exterminate them and i 've never pretended i 'm oppressed sure i 'm trans and my life fucking sucks because of it but i do know who is being harmed it would probably result in a society where people can walk outside and not be attacked for who they are but please i really pity all the white straight men in this thread i 'm sorry minorities are bothering you with issues like basic human rights and respect hopefully we wo n't distract you from your video games for too long ^^ which literally no one

wannabes and moderates who are too comfortable in their position of power to admit they 're part of the larger problem you seem to be conflating sjw with general sja social justice advocate basically
