Thus, in all the aboveRevenue appeals, in the case of two assessees, the appeals varyfrom Assessment years 2000-01 to 2008-09. The only appeal ofassessee in ITA No. 1555/Hyd/2011 is against the order of CIT(A)-I, Hyderabad, dt. 26-07-2011, confirming the addition made by theAO in AY. 2008-09 in the case of M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling MillsPvt. Ltd. Since common issue is involved in all these appeals, wehave considered them together and decided by this common order. 2.   Briefly stated, assessees herein are in the business of re-rolling mills and manufacture of ingots.        Search and seizureoperations u/s. 132 of the Act were conducted on 09-08-2005 inthe business premises of M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd aswell as its sister concern M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industries andalso residential premises of the Directors. Consequently, noticesu/s. 153A dt. 06-02-2006 were issued calling for returns forAssessment years 2000-01 to 2005-06.        The assessments fromAssessment years 2001-02 to 2008-09 were completed at variousperiods but on similar lines. The assessments upto Assessmentyears 2005-06 are u/s. 143(3) r.w.s. 153A, whereas subsequent                                                M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt.

Balaji Steel Rolling Industries alsothe assessments from the Assessment years 2000-01 to 2005-06were completed u/s. 143(3) r.w.s. 153A, whereas assessments forAssessment years 2006-07 to 2008-09 are completed u/s. 143(3). M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,2.1.    For the sake of convenience and clarity, the facts in ITA No.225/Hyd/2012 for the AY. 2002-03 in the case of M/s. Balaji SteelRolling Mills Pvt. Ltd., is considered in detail. ITA No. 225/Hyd/2012 (AY. 2002-03) 3.     In this assessment year, assessee had originally filed returnof income and consequent to the notice u/s. 153A, filed returnadmitting the same loss of Rs. 1,01,187/- as originally returned.Even though there were search and seizure operations, as seenfrom the assessment orders passed there seems to be noincriminating material in the search identified and seized.                     Eventhough certain documents pertaining to quantity's details, detailsof sales and certain transactions with the parties at Jabalpur,Nagpur and Hyderabad etc., were seized and listed as a specificreference in para 3 of the order under the head 'seized material' asseen from the order(s), there is no correlation with those seizeddocuments with reference to any of the specific issues consideredby the AO.      When enquired in the course of arguments, Ld.Counsel admitted that those details are not incriminating butneither assessee nor AO bothered to examine about thesedocuments. The only issue taken up by the AO is with reference to                                            M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,                               :- 4 -:        M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industriesunaccounted production based on the electricity consumption ofthe unit. AO in the course of assessment noticed that assesseehad adopted a modus Operandi of introducing cash in substantialamounts during the financial year as advances and offering themas income under the head 'other income' at the end of the year, asadvances forfeited.   AO noted down in para 5 of the order theextent of advances so forfeited totaling to Rs. 9,19,35,000/-. Eventhough assessee offered on these amounts as incomes underregular returns and not as a consequence of search, AO was of theview that assessee could not substantiate from whom theadvances were received.     He was of the opinion that assesseemight be producing the steel ingots outside the Books of Accountsand proceeds are introduced as advances in the Books ofAccounts.     Therefore, he undertook an exercise of analyzing theconsumption of power recorded in units in the years 2000-01 to2006-07.      Based on the enquiries conducted with M/s. SpongeIron India Ltd., and also on the expertise of a Technical Officerdeputed by that company, the AO came to an opinion that averageconsumption for production of one ton of MS ingots is generallyabout 800 - 850 KWH.        He also opined that as far as presentoperations are concerned, the consumption may be about 1100 -1200 per KWH per ton of ingots considering assessee's businessoperations.     On obtaining the information from Central PowerDistribution Company Limited and taking the consumption in AY.2000-01 as the basis (1260 KWH per ton of ingot), AO arrived atsuppressed production of 2,028 tons out of 59,24,297 KWH unitsof power consumed. Assessee has shown production of 2,673 tonsin the Books of Accounts, whereas AO arrived at possibleproduction at 4,701 tons.         After arriving at the possibleproduction, AO gave credit for the raw-material that may be                                                M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,                                 :- 5 -:          M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industriesrequired to use including 10% burning loss and additionalconsumption of store items, arrived at a suppressed productionvalued at Rs. 1,06,80,527/- in AY. 2002-03 and brought to taxsame amount as 'suppressed income'. In arriving at this working,AO also considered the show cause notices issued by the ExciseDepartment regarding evasion of Excise Duty due to unaccountedclearances, clearance of inputs without payment of duty, clearanceof scrap without payment of Duty and show cause dt. 28-01-1998for non-payment of duty but settled under the 'Kar VivadSamadhan Scheme'. He also considered the amounts of advancesshown in the books to the extent of Rs. 1,49,60,000/- during theyear shown as 'income' in the P & L A/c. 4.   When the issue was carried to the CIT(A), assessee filedvarious grounds and also additional grounds which was referred tothe AO on remand.        Ld. CIT(A) after considering the detailedsubmissions of assessee as extracted in para 4.3, deleted theadditions so made by AO, stating as under: 5.   Ld. DR while supporting the orders of the AO submitted thatthere is no explanation from assessee about excess consumptionof electricity and also referred to press report came in BusinessStandard about the judgment of the CEGAT, dt. 09-05-2011 tosubmit that Revenue finds it difficult to establish that certaingoods were manufactured and removed clandestinely.                              Whilereferring to certain paras in the report, it was submitted that'while in most of the cases, marshalling of evidence acquired fromthe investigation does not prove enough for the Tribunal or thecourse to uphold the allegation of clandestine removal, in few casesthe allegations have survived due to systematic investigation by                                                M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,                                :- 7 -:           M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industriessome very hard working officers of the department'.                     Then, hereferred to the findings in the said case to submit that forproduction of one Metric Ton of mild steel ingots, the averagepower consumption would be in the range of 555 KWH - 1026KWH as per the scientific studies conducted by IIT, Kanpur.                           Itwas submitted that in this case also, the AO has examined theissue meticulously and arrived at the suppressed production andCIT(A) was not correct in deleting the same. 6.     Ld. Counsel for assessee however, relied on the order of theCIT(A) and submitted that : 6.1. Coming to the legal grounds, it was submitted that theassessments have been completed u/s. 143(1) from Assessmentyears 2000-01 to 2004-05 and since no scrutiny was undertaken,these assessments could not get           abated on the basis of the                                                 M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,                                   :- 8 -:         M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industriesdecision of the Special Bench of ITAT in the case of All CargoGlobal Logistics Ltd., Vs. DCIT [137 ITD 287 (SB)] as confirmed bythe Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of CIT Vs. ContinentalWarehousing Corporation (Nhava Sheva) Ltd in ITA No. 523 of2013 dt.21-04-2015, It is further submitted that even thoughHon'ble jurisdictional High Court in the case of Gopal LalBhadruka Vs. DCIT [346 ITR 106] (AP) has upheld the additions,in spite of not having incriminating material                     Ld. Counselsubmitted that the Co-ordinate Bench at Bombay in the case ofACIT Vs. Jayendra P. Jhaveri [65 SOT 118] (Mumbai) (URO) hasheld that where re-assessments made by the AO u/s. 153Awithout any incriminating material being found during searchaction, are not in accordance with law and consequently,returned/original assessments which acquired finality are to bereiterated.   Apart from the legal principles, Ld. Counsel alsoreferred to the orders passed by the Central Excise Authoritieswhich are also relied before the CIT(A) to submit that there is nosuppressed production or suppressed sales as per the CentralExcise/Sales Tax Authorities. It was submitted that order of theCIT(A) is to be upheld. 7.    We have considered the rival contentions and perused andorders of the authorities. As can be seen from the orders of theAO, even though it refers to certain documents which areimpounded / seized, no adverse view was taken about the contentstherein. The order does not speak of any incriminating nature ofthe said documents. The only issue which AO has adjudicated isthe high consumption of electricity in assessee's case. As per theaverage   norm   of   an   ideal     business   situation,           the       powerconsumption would be around 800 - 1000 KWH, on which there                                                    M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,                                     :- 9 -:          M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industriesare various studies.            But is it possible to determine theunaccounted production on the basis of the ideal consumption ofpower in an ideal unit. Generally in the market, various cars aresold with the projection of 20 to 23 KMs per liter of mileage but onroad conditions, it is everybody's experience that car does notgiven more than 10 to 12 KMs mileage per liter. There is a lot ofvariation between ideal test conditions and actual businessconditions.          It was assessee's explanation that high powerconsumption was a result of : In view of this, it was submitted that consumption of power ishigh. AO has taken sufficient pains in referring the matter to theChairman and Managing Director of Sponge Iron India Ltd., andalso being examined by a Technical Officer of the said company,but there is a disclaimer by the company itself that thosestatements made by the Technical Officer is based on his personalexperiences and cannot be used adversely. That it self takes awaythe basis of AO's working. Not only that, AO himself accepts thatassessee's consumption of 1,260 KWH is on the basis of theproduction figures as shown in AY. 2001-02. He has taken thatyear as basis for arriving at the production in all the impugnedassessment years including the later year of 2006-07 to 2008-09(post search) on the same basis.               He has not considered theobjections raised by assessee at all.           Moreover, as explained byassessee's counsel and also considered the Ld. CIT(A), the various                                             M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,                              :- 10 -:         M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industriesshow cause notices issued by the Excise Department have beenmore or less settled in favour of assessee and no adverse view canbe taken on the basis of the show cause notices. It has no bearingon the sales figures of assessee, as there is no case of CentralExcise for any suppressed production. Even though, Ld. DR reliedon the Central Excise case press note before us, it is a case by theCentral Excise Department for suppressed production on ameticulous enquiry by the officer which was upheld by theTribunal. In this case, in spite of conducting search and seizureoperations, no incriminating material was found. As seen from theorder in ITA No. 1555/Hyd/2011 (which will be considered later inthis order), Ld. CIT(A) while upholding the addition in that year,gave credit to the amount of advances forfeited and shown as'income', which Revenue has accepted and has not contested. Ifthe same stand is taken, assessee's income offered by way offorfeiture of advances is to the extent of Rs. 1,49,60,000/-whereas, the addition made was only Rs. 1,06,80,527/-. In view ofthat also, there is no scope for any addition being made in thepresent case. As rightly contended by the Ld. Counsel, Books ofAccounts were not rejected.      The addition made by the AO ispurely on the basis of estimation of power consumption andsupposedly suppressed production cannot be sustained in theabsence of any evidence on record. Keeping these aspects in mind,we uphold the order of the Ld. CIT(A) and reject the Revenue'sgrounds. In the result, this appeal is dismissed. ITA Nos. 226 to 230/Hyd/2012 8.   The facts being same except amounts involved in the aboveappeals, we uphold the orders of the CIT(A) and reject theRevenue's contentions.                                                  M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,                                 :- 11 -:          M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industries 9.    In the results, appeals in ITA Nos. 225 to 230/Hyd/2012 aredismissed. M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industries: 10.   As seen from various appeals Revenue has completedassessments of this firm using the company PAN number. Only inAY.2008-09 the correct PAN number is used. In these appealsalso, similar to the one which AO passed in the appeals of M/s.Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd. above, the AO estimated thesuppressed production on         similar    lines.       Ld.       CIT(A)        afterconsidering assessee's submissions, deleted the addition more orless on the similar reasons as stated above.               For the sake ofrecord, in AY. 2001-02, AO made an addition of Rs. 30,91,330/-by arriving at the suppressed income while determining the powerconsumption for production of one ton of 'flats and rods' inassessee's business at 200 KWH, after recording that the sisterconcern in AY. 2000-01 consumed only 132 KWH per ton. He alsoallowed burning loss of 12% for the purpose of determiningrequisite raw-material. Since electricity was already debited to theP & L A/c, the suppressed consumption of raw-material was givenset off against the suppressed sales of production and a nominalconsumption of store items. On consumption of 2,83,573/- unitsof power, AO arrived at surplus production at 1,212 tons anddetermined the income at Rs. 30,91,330/-. Ld. CIT(A) vide orderdt. 14-03-2011, deleted the same by stating as under: 5.1. With regard to making addition by the AO on the basis ofpower consumption for production, quantifying the sales afterallowing certain expenses towards cost of raw materials, theappellant has submitted as under :- "While completing the assessment without any evidence on record, theAssessing Officer determined production on the basis of electricityconsumption without appreciating the fact that the appellant's mill is a smallunit and is labour oriented consisting of very old outdated machinery.Consumption of electricity depends on so many factors such as maintenanceof electrical equipment, irregular supply of electricity, power shutdown,fluctuation in power and quality and quantity of raw material. The AssessingOfficer compared the power consumption with reference to the Sponge IronIndia Limited, a Public sector undertaking which is modernized and fullyequipped automatic unit. The production of finished Goods depends onvarious factors such as quality and quantity of raw material and climaticconditions. The production of appellant's unit is subject to levy of excise dutyand the officials of the Excise Department visit the factory premises every nowand then and keep watch on removal of goods and payment of excise duty andthey also come for audit of production and payment of duty on removal ofgoods. Sales Tax assessments have been completed for all the above assessmentyears and no discrepancy has been noticed in the reported turnover. There isno evidence with the department to prove that the appellant had manufacturedcertain goods and removed them other than what has been declared. Properexcise registers have been maintained. The information obtained from theTechnical Officer cannot be relied on for the simple reason that the Chairman-cum-Managing Director of the said company has specifically stated in hiscommunication to the department as under:- "Please note that information furnished by our Officer is basedon his individual knowledge / views expressed and it cannot betaken is an authority for any purpose as it may differ from thepoint of view of other technical officer" In other words, the Managing Director of the Sponge Iron India Ltd.,is not sure about the actual consumption of Unit for manufacturingof foods as the appellant already stated herein above consumptionof electricity depends upon the various factors since the appellant'sunit is a labour oriented, negligence and laziness of the labourers,slow work tactics, temperature in summer which makes humanbeing partly lazy, unworkable and supply of power with frequentinterruption. All these cause consumption of electricity. Therefore,the figure for arriving the production on the basis of electricityconsumption is not correct and proper method specially, whengoods are subject to levy of excise and sales tax. The AO has not                                                   M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,                                 :- 13 -:            M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industriesfound any deficiency or discrepancy in the books of ale and has notrejected them." The appellant has placed reliance on the following case laws:- (i) N. Rajpullaiah Vs DCTO, Kurnool and another (73 ITR 224 AP). (ii) St.Terasa's Oil Mill Vs State of Kerala reported in ITR 365(Kerala) . (iii) DCIT Vs Royal Marwar Tobacco Product (P) Ltd., reported in(Ahmd.Tribunal) reported in 29 SOT 53 (AHD) (URO). Without prejudice to the above contention, it is, submitted that onthe page-6 of the assessment order, the Assessing Officer hasobserved as under:- "The sums introduced camouflaged as advance is sham source from thesuppressed trading receipts introduced to meet the basis recorded expenditure." Therefore, the Assessing Officer ought to have given credit againstthe estimated income in respect of his own observation which hehas made in respect of amount forfeited and offered as income bythe appellant" 5.2. I have considered the submissions made by the appellant, gonethrough the order of the Assessing Officer. It is a fact that theappellant is a small-scale unit existing for the last many years. Themachinery was very old and power consumption is heavy. It is truethat consumption of electricity depends on so many factors such asmaintenance of electrical equipment, irregular supply of electricity,power shutdown, fluctuation in power and quality and quantity ofraw material etc. It is also a fact that the AO' has compared thepower consumption with reference to the Sponge Iron India Limited,a, Public sector undertaking that is modernized and fully equipped1utomatic unit and thus comparison is ill founded, as it has givenabsurd results. Moreover; ,production of appellant's unit is .subjectto check by excise and sales tax authorities. The officials' of thosedepartments visit now and then keep a watch on production and,removal of finished products and conduct inspection whenever it isfelt necessary. Finally, they make assessments, who have' notfound out any discrepancies, in production and sales. Thus, theadditions. made by the AO for all the impugned assessment yearswith out any material has to be presumed based on surmises andguess work and for such additions there is no place in search andseizure assessments. Thus, I do not have any hesitation indirecting the AO to delete the additions made for all the assessmentyears under challenge".                                                  M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,                                 :- 14 -:          M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industries 11.   After considering the rival contentions and perusing theorders of the authorities, we do not see any reason to interfere withthe order of the CIT(A). In all the impugned years, the additionbeing similar, the reasons given above in the case of M/s. BalajiSteel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd., will equally apply here. In view of thedetailed reasons stated above, we do not see any reason toconsider the Revenue's grounds. In the result, orders of the CIT(A)are upheld and all the appeals in ITA Nos. 862 to 868/Hyd/2012are dismissed. ITA No. 1367/Hyd/2014 : 12.   This order was passed by the CIT(A) on 19-05-2014, whereinLd. CIT(A) deleted the addition of Rs. 35,97,380/- by giving thefollowing reasons: 06.3 On a consideration of the facts of the case for the asst. year2000-01, it is seen that in the instant case, the estimation ofsuppressed income is based only on the working done by theAssessing Officer, after considering the power consumed forproduction, which led him to the conclusion that such powerconsumption must have been made for higher production, whichwas not disclosed by the appellant. However, even if the powerconsumption was on a higher side, it is seen that the Hon'bleSupreme Court in their judgement dated 31-1-2011, in the case ofCommissioner of Central Excise, Meerut Vs. R.A. Casting (P) Ltdhave opined that electricity consumption cannot be taken to be areliable basis for estimating the production of a particular unit.Citing the said decision, the Hon'ble Chandigarh Bench of the ITATin the case of Arora Alloys Ltd Vs. ITO (ITA NO.78jCSDj2012 dated1-3-2012) have opined that the reason for the above view is thatconsumption for electricity depends upon various recrors ike typeand quality of scrap used, number of break downs, quality oflabour/supervisory staff, diligence of management etc. Accordingly,in the said case, the Hon'ble ITAT held that the AO's action inestimating the production of the assessee company on the basis ofalleged excessive consumption of electricity is erroneous andfallacious. It is seen that a similar view has been taken by theHon'ble Ahmedabad Bench of the ITAT in the case of EasternEnterprises Vs. ACIT (ITA NO.352/Ahd/2010 dated 15-6-2012)also, wherein they opined that the consumption of electricity mayrise due to hundreds of factors and therefore, no addition isjustified. 06.4 It is clear that in the present case, apart from estimatingproduction on the basis of excessive consumption of electricity,determined on comparison with the consumption figures of a largepublic sector undertaking, the Assessing Officer has not been ableto bring on record any other evidence to support his conclusionregarding unaccounted production. Following the decisions of theHon'ble ITAT cited above and also the appellate orders passed bythe CIT(A), Guntur and CIT(A)-I, Hyderabad on identical facts andcircumstances in the appellant's own case for Asst. years 2001-02to 2007-08 and Asst.year 2008-09, it is held that there is nojustifiable basis for the addition on account of suppressed income ofRs.35,97,380/- in the Asst.year 2000-01, and the said addition isdeleted and the ground raised on this issue is decided in favour ofthe appellant".                                                  M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,                                  :- 16 -:         M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industries12.1. Since facts are similar and action of the AO is also similar,we do not see any reason to interfere with the order of the CIT(A)for the detailed reasons stated above in the above Revenueappeals. There is no justifiable basis for making the addition andhence, the same was correctly deleted by the Ld.CIT(A).                       In theresult, this appeal is dismissed. ITA No. 27/Hyd/2013 : 13.   In this case also, the AO considered the earlier years' ordersas    a   basis   and   arrived    at    the   suppressed            income           atRs. 40,75,988/-. Ld. CIT(A) vide his order dt. 25-10-2012, deletedthe same by stating as under: 14.   After considering the rival contentions, we do not see anyreason to uphold the Revenue's grounds. For the detailed reasons                                              M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,                               :- 17 -:         M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industriesgiven above, we agree with the order of the CIT(A) that there is nobasis for making any addition.        Accordingly, the grounds arerejected. In the result, this appeal Revenue is dismissed. 15.   One contention of the Ld. Counsel in all the Revenue appealsis that the additions cannot be made in the proceedings u/s. 153Awhen there is no incriminating material. He relied on the SpecialBench decision of All Cargo Global Logistics Ltd., Vs. DCIT [137ITD 287 (SB)] (supra) and also Co-ordinate Bench at Bombay inthe case of ACIT Vs. Jayendra P. Jhaveri [65 SOT 118] (Mumbai)(URO) (supra). However, in view of the jurisdictional High Courtjudgment in the case of Gopal Lal Bhadruka Vs. DCIT [346 ITR106] (AP) (supra), we are of the opinion that AO can take intoconsideration the material other than that available during thesearch and seizure operations, for making an assessment of theundisclosed income of assessee. On legal principles of abatementof assessments in some years, even though there is merit inassessee's contentions with reference to the proceedings u/s. 153Afor some of the impugned assessment years, we find no reason togive any adjudication on this issue, as the deletions made by theCIT(A) on merits were upheld, as there is no material at all to makethe additions. In view of the confirmation of the CIT(A)'s order inthe above appeals, there is no need to adjudicate the legal groundsraised by assessee which are in support of the CIT(A)'s order foracademic reasons. M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,Assessee's appeal in ITA No. 1555/Hyd/2011: 16.   This appeal is by assessee is against the order of the CIT(A)-I,Hyderabad, dt. 26-07-2011.       As can be seen from the above                                                 M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,                                 :- 18 -:          M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industriesappeals of Revenue, three different CIT(A)s have upheld assessee'scontentions and deleted additions, whereas in this assessmentyear, Ld. CIT(A) confirmed the addition so made by stating thefollowing reasons:      Had the advance received by the appellant being genuine, the     appellant would have produced the details of the payers for further     verification. The appellant failed to do so. Therefore, I hold that                                           M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,                           :- 19 -:          M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industriesthere was no infirmity on the part of the AO in computing thesuppressed production which is fortified from the accounting entriesin the appellant's books as other income being advance forfeited.The AO has scientifically worked out the suppressed productionand the suppressed income therefrom. In fact the AO has also givencredit for the consumption of raw material that would have goneinto the suppressed production. He has also given credit forexpenditure of Rs.12 lakhs which in view is quite reasonable sincethe usual expenditure has already been booked by the appellantand debited to P & L A/c. Even the burning loss at 10% allowed bythe AO is reasonable. In fact, in the case of SRJ Peety Steels whichis relied on by the appellant, it is found that the burning lossreported in that case was as low as 1.73% to 2.46%. Accordingly,the burning loss of 10% as allowed by the AO is definitelyreasonable and no interference is called for. 04.1 The appellant has also relied on the decisions in the case ofRoyal Marwar Tobacco Products and in the case of SRJ Peety Steelsreferred to above. In my view the case laws are distinguishablesince the main issue in those cases was whether the assessmentu/s 153A can be completed without any incriminating material onhand. The assessment in the case under consideration wascompleted u/s 143(3) and not u/s 153A/153C. Further theAssessing officer has heavily relied on the fact that the appellantitself has introduced cash in its books in the form of advanceforfeited which appellant also in a way agrees that it is salereceipts from sales not materialized. Thus the case laws relied onby the appellant is not squarely applicable in its case. Thus,considering the totality of fact I confirm the method of computationof income arising out of suppressed production at Rs.2,16,l1,739/-as worked out by the AO . 05.0 The appellant contends that the expenditure incurred forsuppressed production is on the low side and needs revision. Nofurther explanation has been filed by the appellant as to how theexpenditure allowed by the AO over and above the normalexpenditure booked by the appellant in its books of etc is on thelower side. As discussed earlier, the AO has allowed 10% burningloss in addition to expenditure of 12 lakhs while working out thesuppressed income. In view thereof, I hold that the expenditureallowed by the AO is reasonable and does not call for anyinterference".                                               M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd.,                               :- 20 -:         M/s. Balaji Steel Rolling Industries 17.     This assessment is outside the search period. AO has takenup the scrutiny u/s. 143(3). However, instead of examining theBooks of Accounts of this year, as seen from the assessment order,AO listed out the so called seized material, show cause noticesissued by the Central Excise authorities and the amounts offeredas incomes upto AY. 2007-08 by way of forfeiture of advances inthe order and on similar lines arrived at the suppressed income atRs. 2,16,11,739/-.     Ld. CIT(A) as seen from the above order,upheld the contentions of the AO for the reasons stated by him.However, he has directed the AO to give credit to the other incomeadmitted by assessee in the Books of Accounts. 18.     After considering the rival contentions, we do not see anyreason to uphold the order of the CIT(A) and AO on the issue. Asin all the years decided above, the addition is made on the basis ofthe presumptions and surmises, without there being any evidenceleave alone any incriminating material. Order cannot be upheldwhich was based on presumptions and surmises.                       Assessee'sobjections with reference to Books of Accounts have not beenrejected; there is no incriminating material; the report of SpongeIron India Ltd., cannot be taken as basis      has to be upheld asvalid. Since the assessment is not u/s. 153A, the legal objectionsraised by assessee are not applicable to the impugned assessmentyear.    But there is no evidence at all with AO and all otherauthorities like Central Excise and Sales Tax authorities have notmade out any case of surplus production or suppressed sales.                       Inthe absence of any evidence on record, AO's action cannot beupheld. There are no justifiable reasons for making the addition. 19.    To sum-up, all the Revenue appeals are dismissed andassessee's appeal is allowed.
