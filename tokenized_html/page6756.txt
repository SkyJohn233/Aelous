govt mulls removing time bar on filing child sex abuse complaints recipient s mail your name your e-mail id your comment maneka gandhi the women and child development wcd ministry will seek a change in the code of criminal procedure crpc to allow filing of complaints of child sexual abuse many years after the crime the development came after a meeting last month between wcd minister maneka gandhi and a 53-year-old indian-origin scientist from canada a survivor of child sexual abuse who asked for legislative amendments to allow victims to report such crimes even years later. we are in the process of writing to the ministry of home affairs asking them to amend section 473 of the code of criminal procedure so time limitation will go away secretary wcd r.k. shrivastava said at a press meet on monday he said that the ministry will pursue the matter with the mha as it has been receiving several complaints of incidents that have occurred many years ago. while officials did not comment on the exact amendment being suggested gandhi told reporters the substance of it will be that if you have been molested at some point in time when you were a minor then you are still entitled to get justice. she however said that there could be a problem revisiting old cases of crime. only problem i envisage is that how do you prove it but the best we can hope is that people get frightened that they could land in trouble gandhi said the wcd ministry has also instructed the national commission for protection of child rights ncpcr to look into the issue section 468 of the crpc lays down time limitations for filing a complaint after an offence has taken placeâ€”this is also called the statute of limitations if the offence is punishable with a fine then it needs to be reported within six months a crime carrying a term not exceeding one year has a period of limitation of a year if a crime is punishable between one and three years then it has to be reported within three years and for anything beyond a three-year jail term there is no time restriction for reporting the crime section 473 of the crpc to which the ministry has sought changes allows a court to take cognisance of an offence even after the expiry of the period of limitation provided the delay has been properly explained or that it is necessary to do so in the interests of justice. the 53-year-old scientist was subjected to sexual abuse for seven years between the age of six and 13 years the protection of children from sexual offences pocso act 2012 is unclear on whether a survivor of child sexual abuse can report the crime after the age of 18 years moreover the pocso act can not be applied retrospectively to cases prior to its enactment in 2012 and such cases fall under the provisions of the indian penal code when it comes to punishment for rape ipc section 376 there is no statute of limitations however it was only after the criminal amendment act of 2013 that the definition of rape was expanded to include forced digital penetration and oral sex both common in child sexual abuse until then these crimes fell under the molestation law ipc section 354 which has a maximum punishment of two years and therefore unlike penile penetration has a statute of limitations whereby it has to be reported within three years of the offence being committed while the scientist approached the chennai police last year to file a complaint all her efforts came to nought she says enabling latter-day reporting can prevent many more children from falling prey to sexual crimes. both the policy and the general attitude of the police is that you ca n't file a complaint if you are an adult survivor a lot of child abusers are repeat offenders for me it is not only a matter of personal justice but also a matter of protecting children of today from repeat molesters she had told in an interview tn catholic priest arrested for allegedly making schoolgirls view porn 99 per cent child abuse victims aren t paid interim compensation by govt french surgeon may have molested nearly 200 children britain s prince andrew denies meeting sex accuser us mother machelle hobson arrested for child abuse dies govt to set up 1023 fast track courts for speedy trial of 1 66 lakh rape pocso cases shahjahanpur student s classmates cry foul as sit probes charges against chinmayanand goa swimming coach accused of rape arrested in delhi copyright 2019 all rights reserved
