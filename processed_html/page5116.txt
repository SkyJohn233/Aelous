BlueMath - numpy like math library for Javascript : javascript Numpy and pandas are two of the main reasons why I will never use javascript for my backend. All the web development I &# x27;ve done has been for visualizing and interacting with numerical data which I process and serve with python over a websocket. I don &# x27;t think javascript is ever going to beat python there. Yes. But won &# x27;t it be better if you could do everything that numpy does right in browser? Then you won &# x27;t need any server side components or worry about communication between them. What do you mean? They &# x27;re both Turing-complete afaik. Cool idea. Runs slow though. That &# x27;s true of many web technologies. They start slow, but improve as time passes. 728k Members 828 Online Jan 25, 2008 Cake Day
