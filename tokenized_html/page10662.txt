poseidon 's underworld a sheet of reynolds rap a 1950 s universal groomed cutie that i hadn t heard of poseidon once again i tip my hat to you incidentally mr. reynolds aged much much better than many of his contemporaries judging by the 1970 s-era photos and caps thank you tjb i m glad you liked it and that i was capable of surprising you like that i did come across an even more recent shot of reynolds but it was not a great photo in general and the man is 80 now so i let it be he was indeed a cutie how delightful to come upon this biography of william reynolds an actor who always had a special place in my heart and elsewhere i can still vividly remember watching one critical scene in the islanders w. reynolds and his flying partner james philbrook were running from some dangerous pursuers reaching the beach they spot their seaplane out on the water as those two men race across the sands each rips open and tosses off their shirts i recall that moment still and the curious previously unknown way my body responded to it oh i m not saying that those naked sweaty eminently-lickable chests made me gay i m merely saying thanks guys ha vilflor love that story thanks for sharing i know that i and many many underworld visitors have lots of similar remembrances such as yours they sear the mind like a branding iron a superb bio just one correction needed though 20th century fox produced desert fox not mgm kent no clue how i made such a weird slip as that must have been distracted at the time while typing 80 of this blog is done while i m at work but don t tell anyone it s fixed now very informative i stopped watching the fbi after his character was dropped thanks cynthia it s strange that mr. reynolds had a fairly prolific career on tv and in movies but is scarcely known to most people glad he had a fan in you fyi cynthia and anyone else who may be interested i did something today that i rarely do in that i went back and added a few pictures to this post revisiting it gave me a taste for more william reynolds and i came upon three pics i wanted to work in there s a tinted bubble gum card of him another pic from the land unknown in torn clothes and a color cover from a tv listing guide during his show pete kelly s blues. abusive or hateful comments will be removed
