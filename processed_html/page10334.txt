Got this error when setting the data-netdata to "sensors.temp_thermal_zone0_thermal_thermal_zone0": sensors.temp_thermal_zone0_thermal_thermal_zone0: chart not found on url "/api/v1/chart?chart=sensors.temp_thermal_zone0_thermal_thermal_zone0" It does exists on the system: $ ls /var/cache/netdata/sensors.temp_thermal_zone0_thermal_thermal_zone0/ main.db                                            sys_devices_virtual_thermal_thermal_zone0_temp.db And going to the url shows that it does exist: http://192.168.1.150:19999/api/v1/chart?chart=sensors.temp_thermal_zone0_thermal_thermal_zone0 Is this some bug or am I doing something wrong here? If you press F12 on your browser, you can see the URL your dashboard attempts to fetch. Can you post it here? Oh I just checked my code and you are right. I forgot to change the data source from my other server where I tried it on first, which also have netdata so the data steam was still flowing making me believe that it actually failed on my rpi. Haven't had the chance to switch it yet but I'm certain that this is the problem. Sorry for this and keep up the good work!
