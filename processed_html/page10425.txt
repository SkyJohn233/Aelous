spfc.org : tour history - songs Ever wanted to know when certain songs were played? Or how many times they were played? Here you can! This section is organized by song- you can also view the tour history  by date . Note: due to incomplete setlist information (particularly for early years/older songs), this section is not terribly accurate. If you have any information regarding older shows or setlists that aren't available here, please contact  tourhistory@spfc.org . Some specific performances of songs have their own lyrics entered in- these will be linked in red next to the date entry for easy spotting.
