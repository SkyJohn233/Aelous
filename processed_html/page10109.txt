The stadium had won rave reviews after hosting a rain drenched Twenty20 International (T20I) between India and New Zealand last month. Speaking to  IANS , Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) secretary Jayesh George said that the issue could be discussed during the special general body meeting of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) scheduled for December 11. " We, the KCA would only be glad to host the matches here, as we have proved our mettle in organizing an international T20 match and that too in a brand new stadium. We will put up our hands, if this option is there if any team asks for our support, "  George said. The facilities at the stadium earned lavish praise, especially from Indian skipper Virat Kohli. Moreover it was a sell out crowd as well, as the state capital was hosting an international cricket match after three decades. Thus the Delhi Daredevils team might not have to think twice about the revenue aspect as well. The presence of local lad Sanju Samson in the Delhi Daredevils squad may attract more crowd support for the team at this venue.
