[–] Rams King_BronSexual 6058 points 6059 points 6060 points 5 months ago (317 children) So he definitely lied to the chiefs right? [–] Seahawks prophetofgreed 1370 points 1371 points 1372 points 5 months ago (13 children) Chiefs put out a statement saying he lied to them.  [–] Giants scrimaxinc 467 points 468 points 469 points 5 months ago (3 children) but do they have a video of it [–] BriMarsh 100 points 101 points 102 points 5 months ago (0 children) Yes, but you have to wait until September to see it. [–] Jets BenevolentCheese 34 points 35 points 36 points 5 months ago (0 children) TMZ acquires Chiefs video of the Hunt lying that Chiefs are unable to produce.  [–] Chiefs Gnux13 2739 points 2740 points 2741 points 5 months ago (234 children) Was that in question today? Police report said he claimed to have not touched her. Why lie to the police and not your employer [–] Rams Math_OP_Pls_Nerf 1175 points 1176 points 1177 points 5 months ago (217 children) Wait what? Police had direct video evidence that that was a lie, how he wasn ' t arrested is beyond me. [–] Colts apocalypse31 673 points 674 points 675 points 5 months ago (168 children) Did it say that the police had this video? I ' m genuinely asking. [–] Chiefs theDomicron 1062 points 1063 points 1064 points 5 months ago (134 children) This is the most confusing thing to me about the whole thing: if there are no charges pressed, would the police ask for the hotel video?  also confusing: how stupid Kareem Hunt is [–] Titans Keith_Creeper 574 points 575 points 576 points 5 months ago (57 children) A chance to not have to do extra paperwork because everyone declined to press charges?  I seriously doubt they ' d ask to see footage. [–] Packers jtljtljtljtl 266 points 267 points 268 points 5 months ago (53 children) No. Police didn ' t get the video, someone leaked it to TMZ. Someone from that hotel made a goddamn fortune today. They ' ll probably lose their job but it ' s also probably worth it. Police would have gotten the video if charges were filed, but they didn ' t. And the hotel only gives security footage to police, so even if the NFL came around asking for it it would be 100% against their policy to give it out. You have to assume that everyone knew that this video existed, but they didn ' t see it until today because they weren ' t legally allowed to. [–] AFC Michelanvalo 152 points 153 points 154 points 5 months ago (24 children) The police have the video. The NFL and Chiefs both say they requested the video from the PD who declined to release it to them. The hotel also refused to release it to them. A hotel employee sold it to TMZ. [–] Bears Fred_Dickler 82 points 83 points 84 points 5 months ago (10 children) No I ' ve never seen that part of the report, people just interpreted that way because they heard of some body cam footage, regarding the  " witness interviews " , and got that mixed up as the same thing. In reality I think those were just two separate things completely. Maybe the police had this footage? But it ' s starting to seem like they never acquired it (for whatever reason) [–] Chiefs Midwest_man 390 points 391 points 392 points 5 months ago (4 children) That’s what the Chiefs said in their statement. [–] Patriots Deep_In_Thought 182 points 183 points 184 points 5 months ago (3 children) Lied to the Chiefs and lied to the cops that he never touched the gal.. In an age where everything is covered by security cams. That was an incredibly bone headed move by Hunt, in more ways than one.  [–] Giants Ishtastic08 3823 points 3824 points 3825 points 5 months ago (150 children) If you would have told me this morning the fucking Chiefs were cutting Kareem Hunt... [–] Chiefs gyman122 1684 points 1685 points 1686 points 5 months ago (143 children) We went from having an elite running back to having Spencer Ware in five hours. Could be worse I guess [–] mugawatts 871 points 872 points 873 points 5 months ago (84 children) Ya Ware is a very serviceable back who is capable to be a workhorse  [–] Chiefs FuckingJello 552 points 553 points 554 points 5 months ago (72 children) Yeah it ' s not the worst but Hunt was on a cheap contract for 2-3 years and our clear cut #1. Now we have to shift focus in the off-season and use a pick or money we could have used elsewhere (Our D) on a RB.  [–] morkmando 1009 points 1010 points 1011 points 5 months ago (49 children) Le ' Veon ' s agent is on line #1 [–] Chiefs KUCoop 352 points 353 points 354 points 5 months ago (40 children) Can’t afford it [–] Giants Ishtastic08 171 points 172 points 173 points 5 months ago (17 children) Forreal, he’s a starter on at least 10 teams in the NFL, could certainly do worse. [–] Chiefs gyman122 149 points 150 points 151 points 5 months ago (14 children) He was a 1400 yard back in a pretty goddamn average offense a few years back. I think we’ll take a dip because Spence just isn’t nearly as elusive, but he’s a tough runner who catches the ball well and plays the game with urgency. Wonder who we’ll draft this coming year, not too many good backs [–] Saints Bouzal 6252 points 6253 points 6254 points 5 months ago (192 children) This season is fucking bananas  [–] Browns kajkajete 172 points 173 points 174 points 5 months ago (39 children) Honestly wtf. [–] Ravens Hydrium 272 points 273 points 274 points 5 months ago (37 children) Imagine being a pretty gifted RB on a team thats playoff bound with good chances to not only make it to the Superbowl but win it too. You ' ll have a sweet ring and once your rookie contract is up you ' ll be swimming in millions, all you have to do is not hit a woman. Now you find yourself lucky if some team decides to take a flyer on you and they ' ll only have to pay you pennies on the dollar to do it. [–] Steelers bl4ckblooc420 53 points 54 points 55 points 5 months ago (0 children) And no one can even take a flyer on you yet because you landed on the CEL.

[–] Saints ablackmanreplied 210 points 211 points 212 points 5 months ago (37 children) Yep you know he will be signed before the end of the season and they will say they can reform him with their team culture  [–] Vikings -jjjjjjjjjj- 123 points 124 points 125 points 5 months ago (15 children) I mean its probably true. He could probably be reformed. Whether he deserves a second chance is another issue, but people can definitely be reformed.

They ' ve been plainly dishonest too many times in the past. However, I have to commend the hell out of this decision. Violence against women has become such a prominent issue in the NFL that the only way I can think of that would effectively dissuade that sort of behavior is to make it clearly, unconditionally obvious that it will get you fired. [–] Chiefs UndeadVinDiesel 508 points 509 points 510 points 5 months ago (74 children) It is being reported that Hunt lied about how things went down to the Chiefs FO. They may give second chances to players who make dumb mistakes, but they do not tolerate dishonesty. [–] Texans 440k 1903 points 1904 points 1905 points 5 months ago (29 children) I kind of hope the Chiefs re-sign Akeem Hunt, assign him 27, and just pretend like this whole thing never happened.

A top 5 back in his second season getting straight up cut?  That’s a pretty big message sent. The NFL has to clean up this shit and maybe this is a first step.  [–] Broncos TheThirstyMayor 109 points 110 points 111 points 5 months ago (5 children) Though I strongly dislike the Chiefs, I wanted to comment that I ' ve been impressed by the vast majority of Chiefs fans commenting in  r/nfl  during this debacle.  In many of the threads I ' ve seen, KC fans were among those advocating for the harshest punishment.  I ' m not endorsing this decision or looking to debate - I just want to note that the reaction has been better than most other scandals that I can remember.  Making a conscious decision to do the  ' moral '  thing regardless of on-field ramifications is always hard.

He dropped in the draft, but Chiefs did their homework and decided he was worth the risk. He is now engaged to the woman he hit and by all accounts is a good father to the kid she was pregnant with at the time. This all happened before he ever got a chance in the NFL and it cost him millions. He would have gone a lot higher in the draft. He has had zero issues since entering the league and is always vocal about being thankful the chiefs gave him a chance. Hunt had two incidents while being a part of the team and most likely lied about the severity of what happened. Chiefs can win without Hunt and this is the right move for the team. This would be a PR disaster at the worst time had chiefs not cut him. He is a great talent, but this is Mahomes '  team and we have good RB depth. Best wishes to Hunt. I don ' t think he is a shitty human. He just seems to have made a shitty decision  that cost him his career most likely.
