I &# x27;m wasting my youth : introvert 23 M... A year after graduating I &# x27;m starting to realize how many amazing people I missed out on in college. I haven &# x27;t made a friend since junior high. I live with my parents now and have an ok job (except night shift part), but I &# x27;m really starting to feel intense shame for not having a single friend. I don &# x27;t even want to visit extended family anymore because I don &# x27;t really do anything or know anyone at all, and I &# x27;m ashamed to tell them that. I &# x27;m starting to get tired of life. It &# x27;s scary. Parents got me a therapist and she &# x27;s nice but idk what to do anymore. I guess I &# x27;m not really an introvert, but maybe I am. Sorry if I &# x27;m rambling. I think I &# x27;ll be okay eventually, just not sure how. Couple nights ago I had a dream about this cute resident mentor a few floors up in my freshman dorm. In the dream we just talked but I felt really lonely when I woke up. You &# x27;re lucky to realize this now! I didn &# x27;t realize what I &# x27;d missed out on until I was nearly 30. I was bullied in school and it left me with the feeling that people were only including me because they felt like they had to. It took me a long time to learn to interact with people. I still have a hard time finding the meaningful relationships with people that I desire, but I am at least trying. Even if it means having grin and bear small talk while I try to discover if the person I &# x27;m talking to is actually I interesting. I am in the exact same situation. I &# x27;m not sure why either. I can get along with people and even make them laugh. But at the end of the day, I may have just been protecting myself. I just can &# x27;t get close to people or I am afraid how much of a sham they will think of me. I study engineering and I literally feel shit telling people what degree I m doing. Not that it is stupid, it just yields the same response of  " you must be smart "  even though in reality, I am average at best. Plus the main thing is. I am just terrible at maintaining relationships. Plenty of times I would be invited out or have a set plan but only for it to fall through. Eventually I just stopped trying... So now, same place as you are. I do envy those with a group of friends to uphold them on their worst days but why can &# x27;t I have that too? Your post struck a chord. I am much older than 23 but what you wrote resonates well with how I felt at that age. My 20s were a kind of wasteland and not much memorable happened. Like you wrote, I felt my life slipping by very quickly and my youth was being wasted. I had one or two friends, was socially invisible. Family members told me I was acting like an old man. I didn &# x27;t even recognize, much less deal with, my own introversion and shyness until I was well into my 50s. Between my 20s and 50s, life was a confusing battle, but I did engage the struggle and overcame some obstacles. I assumed I was just like everyone else and everyone else was just like me, except there was this unexplained gulf between what other people were capable of and the limited set of things I could do socially. There are many paths to being introverted and/or shy, but I &# x27;d put this idea out there: it may have something to do with family dynamics, and your remaining in the same family situation as a grown adult could block the change you need. For what it &# x27;s worth, here &# x27;s what I did: after years of internal struggle and living at home with parents and the same old high school friends, I made a clean break and went to school in a far-off city. I was forced to make new friends and make a fresh start. The amazing thing was that within a short time, a group of other youngish people reached out to me and invited me into their social group, without judgement. Looking back now, I realize they must have recognized my kind of personality and dealt with it and just accepted me. It was an amazing time and a time of great change and growth. It wasn &# x27;t that my introverted and shy nature suddenly evapourated. It was that it didn &# x27;t matter to my circle of friends, and I modelled my life on their more outwardly oriented style. They accepted me for what I was and we moved on from there through our academic studies. Much later in life, I finally recognized and accepted myself and now a lot of mysteries make perfect sense. It would have been interesting to have this insight at age 23, but it wasn &# x27;t meant to be. I understand how you feel.  I have few friends, fewer very close friends. I &# x27;m two decades older than you- so feel I can give some advice that might help, might not.  I am a very private person, and don &# x27;t do much socially, and it drains me. I was almost where you are.  Don &# x27;t fault yourself for being solitary. take your time -   find a hobby that you really like - that &# x27;s one way to at least get out and meet some folks. oh. and - from experience -- I too regret staying silent and not meeting and talking to the people in college - say hello - give a compliment, interaction complete.  It may seem like nothing, but you will be remembered and it may lead to more. I &# x27;m 31 and I remember feeling the same in my 20s. I forced myself to be active, to go out etc. many times. Now I realize that was the reason I felt into being alcohol addict those times. I regret that I didn &# x27;t just let me be myself. From the other hand, recently after some panic attacks, I realised that life is just a chance to do something, at leat have a fun of it. So generally don &# x27;t be afraid to do what you like. Most importantly don &# x27;t stress yourself that you are not living perfect, cause such thing does not exists. (so many people starving, you are lucky being a westerner) What do you want?  Whatever it may be (friends, a significant other, a better job, a healthier body, etc), don &# x27;t let any one stop you from getting it, even yourself.  Introverts tend to get into their own way more often than anything else. Post-college life is very unstructured.  More so than ever before it is up to you to make things happen. I &# x27;ve written out a good  " life plan "  but I don &# x27;t stick to it. I &# x27;m not very disciplined. I &# x27;m 31 and I remember feeling the same in my 20s. I forced myself to be active, to go out etc. many times. Now I realize that was the reason I felt into being alcohol addict those times. I regret that I didn &# x27;t just let me be myself.

(so many people starving, you are lucky being a westerner) You sound like a socially anxious extravert, not an introvert. Introversion isn &# x27;t being afraid to talk to people, and introverts are more contented with less social interaction provided the interactions themselves are more intimate. You sound like a person who has little going on in their life and so latches on to other people providing that missing value for them. Connecting with people isn &# x27;t particularly hard provided you acquire interest, skills, and hobbies that lend towards interacting with people. I &# x27;d advise you stop beating around the bush and wallowing in your own self created problem. Pick up some interest, pick up some hobbies, connect with others. This just seems like some friendly opinions. I want my money back. Maybe look around and see if there are any clubs relating to any of your interests near you. I definitely relate to how you &# x27;re feeling, I like to make music and write songs so I recently went to an open mic night and I talked briefly with some cool people there. It helped me realize that there are people out there who I can relate to. Everyone has regrets, you can &# x27;t let that rule your life. Getting yourself out there will be uncomfortable but it &# x27;s necessary for you to change. Those amazing people you  &# x27;missed out on &# x27; in college are still out there and there are probably more out there than you think there are. Even introverts need friends. :) Edit: maybe  &# x27;want &# x27; is a better word than  &# x27;need &# x27;, I don &# x27;t know I don &# x27;t think people you didn &# x27;t even manage to connect with would have made good friends or offered you whatever experience you &# x27;re looking for. You  can  put yourself out there and meet people through various means, but if stuff doesn &# x27;t happen naturally and you have to try ridiculously hard to mantain a relationship with them, it defeats the purpose. You probably didn &# x27;t miss out on anything. I never get past the acquaintance phase with anyone and I don &# x27;t really know why. I can &# x27;t say I took advantage of all the social opportunities in college very well at all. I &# x27;m in the same situation, but I &# x27;m 24 and haven &# x27;t finished college because I &# x27;m so indecisive and have no friends.  My fear of speaking in public also doesn &# x27;t help. I hope that some things change. I kind of became a introvert and I daydream about having someone to talk to. It sounds like you &# x27;re depressed, or are getting depressed. In terms of feeling  " tired "  of life, and it sounds a bit like you may suffer from anhedonia (loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities). You haven &# x27;t said it straight out, but I get that sense from your post. Tell me if I &# x27;m totally off. You certainly could also be introverted. I have a hard time driving relationships, and it sounds like a lot of introverts have a similar problem. Basically, you let the other person decide how to go from acquaintances to friends. The best solution is taking risks and making yourself vulnerable and inviting people to do things! And not taking it personally when they say no. Just like with dating, keep trying, keep putting yourself out there. It &# x27;s exhausting, and hard, and your ability to do it will probably fluctuate. But I think that &# x27;s the only solution. I &# x27;m working on that one myself, still... Everyone has to try with relationships, no matter what kind. By not trying, your basically just putting the onus on the other person to keep the relationship going, and they &# x27;re going to get real tired of that real quick. Saying  " if they &# x27;re not easy, then they &# x27;re not worth it "  is a total cop-out. I still enjoy stuff I used to like, I &# x27;m just tired of watching life go by and it not being how I want it. As for introversion, my understanding of it is that it entails  " losing "  energy from social activities. I feel more energized talking to people, especially those I find interesting. I should try more, I &# x27;m just kinda lazy I guess. Working on it though. For some of us it takes a lot of effort. But if you put in the effort now you may have those friends for a long time. I &# x27;m in mid life and wish I had forced myself to put in more effort along the way. I am awkwardish, need a lot of quiet time , and always feel like I am putting people out. I realize that some people have natural instincts and habits that allow them to not only make friends easier but maintain and grow those friendships easier at the early stages. Can you make work friends? At your age that was a good source of casual friends for me. If you can find a day or swing shift job it would probably make that easier as well as improve your mental health. Night shift work is really really bad for you. www.7cups.com  is the place where you must go Do you have any hobbies that you are really into? Also if you live in a large city you might want to see if there are any local introverted group that organize get together, that is a starting step. I &# x27;d recommend thinking about something that you have always wanted to learn how to do and then go do it. It is hard, but it &# x27;s worth it to get out and meet people. I &# x27;m sorry you had to deal with a toxic relationship like that. Hope it works out for you. You should stop masturbating, it might help. And do pushups every day Many of the healthy and confident introverts are being driven out of this sub because it &# x27;s getting overrun by people that think social anxiety is introversion. I don &# x27;t get annoyed by constant messages and I don &# x27;t have to argue why I don &# x27;t like to hang out, I leave a straight reply and that &# x27;s it. My anxiety decreased since I did that and if I wanna read messages without anyone noticing, I just use Airplane mode. I often told my friends and people around me I need a lot of time for myself. Usually I explain myself because I feel like it &# x27;s necessary, but I feel like this comes from me not appreciating the stuff I do in my free time. People always tell me to be more organized and fulfill my duties, so unfortunately I ain &# x27;t got time 👀 When I was fit and had sharp facial features, they would tell me on the first date that they thought I was arrogant but were attracted to me because of that. Now that I &# x27;m obese, they think I &# x27;m a creep and some even point and laugh at me. It saddens me knowing how my life was in comparison to now, but I &# x27;m still happy regardless. It just sucks that people judge you differently as an introvert simply because of how your body looks. Sigh. Oh well, off to watch some more anime and drink some hot chocolate (: I feel so lonely. I work with all these people and I try to be nice and funny and helpful. I know I am an introvert, I ' m not super outgoing or talkative but I try. But I feel like I can ' t make a connection with anyone. Everyone I work with has worked all together before and they all seem like such good friends. I try but I feel like they are only nice to me because I have to work with them. I don ' t get invited to outside things and when outside plans happen they whisper around me. I just feel unwanted by everyone. I ' ve never posted anything here before but I just feel like I had to get it out. Maybe I am just whining or maybe I am just overthinking everything, I don ' t know. So I ' ve been a introvert since the beginning of my teen years and I get really clingy with people with I really like when its ether romantic or platonic I was just wondering if any other introverted people have experienced this? 167k Members 192 Online Aug 27, 2008 Cake Day
