cal thomas kudos to dianne feinstein opinion austin american-statesman austin tx here 's a sentence i never thought i would write dianne feinstein was right a small group of middle- and high-school children from the san francisco bay area visited the democratic senator from california last week to demand she support the green new deal a collection of environmental policies even some democrats find too extreme too costly and too fantastical what followed was the kind of lecture that is almost absent in a modern culture that overemphasizes youth one of the students an unidentified 16-year-old was quoted by the washington post we have come to a point where our earth is dying and it is literally a pricey and ambitious plan that is needed to deal with the magnitude of that issue so we 're asking you to vote 'yes on the resolution for the green new deal because feinstein interrupted that resolution will not pass the senate and you can take that back to whoever sent you here.\ she added i know what can pass and i know what ca n't pass.\ behind the student group is an organization known as the sunrise movement which describes itself as a movement to stop climate change and create millions of new jobs in the process.\ there is more gobbledygook about an army of young people who are scared about the climate crisis\ and the familiar condemnation of fossil fuels corporate executives and their influence on our politics.\ in other words they are environmental extremists sunrise criticized feinstein for being callous toward the young people in fact this grown-up gave them a reality lesson another child and that 's what they are in law and biology one alexandria villasenor a 13-year-old seventh-grader has spent the last nine fridays sitting on a bench outside the united nations in new york demanding action on climate change on march 15 beware the ides of march she will be part of a school strikes for climate\ demonstration the post reports the worldwide demonstrations will be supported by some of the world 's biggest environmental groups how does a 13-year-old and other teens acquire such knowledge most likely they are simply parroting what their teachers have been telling them climate change is simply the latest fad like tattoos and body piercing once were when i was their age skipping school meant a call to my parents from the principal 's office with quick punishment to follow the problem in too many of our public schools universities and much of culture is that we have handed over control to people who do n't know what they are talking about adults at least ones thought to have acquired wisdom which is different from knowledge were once tasked with leading the young now in too many instances we seem to be following them what happened this is a case of the climate-change chickens coming home to roost which political party has promoted end-of-the-world scare tactics for decades not republicans but like nostradamus and other apocalyptic prognosticators when the world does n't end on the date predicted the sky-is-falling crowd simply moves on to the next prediction sen. feinstein said to the children some of whom spouted familiar slogans as if they were programmed you know what 's interesting about this group is i 've been doing this for 30 years i know what i 'm doing you come in here and say 'it has to be my way or the highway i do n't respond to that.\ that 's called acting like an adult in today 's culture older adults are thought to lack knowledge because they did n't grow up with the internet a little humility and more study might benefit these kids as would different teachers textbooks or even a change in schools cal thomas is marking his 35th year as a syndicated columnist readers may email him
