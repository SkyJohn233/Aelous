strenuous program and i like staying busy that way but on breaks when i have too much time i sink into nothingness i did n't expect this book to do much especially since i thought 'mindfulness was some bs even if it 's the same prompts every day it 's what you make out of the book i like mentally checking off the three small accomplishments i held myself accountable for in ink somehow the book is better than my post-it note to-do lists and the main reason for the five stars it helps with my depression — kellbell get it from amazon for 13.46 share on facebook share on pinterest share on

on pinterest share on pinterest share on email share on copy promising review after reading a glowing review by a frequent international flyer i decided the twistable travel pillow was exactly what my husband needed that traveler returned from an overseas trip and immediately purchased his second one for his lumbar region so i bought two upfront but not for air travel my husband has osteoporosis with an overly curved upper back it is uncomfortable for him to sit for long periods even in his recliner well many snores later he decided these were the perfect solution that evening i placed one behind my neck just to test it out apparently i had no idea how uncomfortable it actually was just sitting my neck never had it so good so i used the lumbar one as well felt like i was floating in the chair have shown them to everyone a physical therapist friend went gaga over the concept and plans to give them as gifts this year — smb get it from amazon for 24.99 available in two colors share on

pinterest share on email share on copy promising review my fiance is incredibly happy with these when she wears her hair down she likes to keep a ponytail holder on hand in case she wants to put her hair up but she does n't like the pressure and indentation left around her wrist she uses the thicker goody rubberbands which fit nicely on this bracelet and look good too she has n't had any problems with the rubberbands slipping off and they can be squeezed together to tighten around the wrist but would probably be a bit too large for tiny wrists it is a nice enough piece of jewelry that she will sometimes even wear them without needing the hair tie per her suggestion brown hair ties look good with the rose gold but black would look better with the silver — rick ideker get it from amazon for

color options share on facebook share on pinterest share on pinterest share on email share on copy promising review i bought these pencils originally as a gift but after sharpening them i ended up keeping them for myself these pencils are circular in design meaning once they are so small that you can no longer use them to write they serve a new purpose as a plant it s a wonderful concept — erica d. medrano get a pack of eight from amazon for 14.95 share on facebook share on pinterest share on pinterest share on email share on copy promising review they are one-size-fits-all so if you

share on email share on copy promising review this is a delightful product the jelly ball comes encased in a balloon and comes with a pick tool to pop the balloon while still in a plastic shell however my pick just made a hole in the balloon and i had to cut it open a bit more with some scissors but it was still really fun to open it has a nice light smell and it lathers well and i really enjoyed rubbing the weird squishy texture all over my face you can keep the jelly ball in the plastic case it comes in but i have a cheap makeup brush cleaner that i put mine in and it looks like a rose quartz crystal ball i just bought it for fun but it might become a regular part of my skincare routine — kindle customer get it from amazon for 11.32 share on facebook share on pinterest share on pinterest share on email share on copy promising review beautiful earrings especially for the great price i got so many compliments — xcharli get them from amazon for 12.99+ available in seven designs share on facebook share on pinterest share on pinterest share on email share on copy promising review this wallet is so great so much better than even much more expensive wallets that i 've purchased i 'm sensitive to smells and was concerned that it might smell after reading some reviews complaining about that — it does n't smell at all the yellow color is amazingly bright i am always misplacing things but i never lose track of this wallet the best thing about it is the envelope design it opens up and you can see everything clearly no flipping through tabs/panels it has just the right amount of organizational space for me — not so little that i get messy but not so much that i get overwhelmed and/or confused there are three slots for credit cards there is a pen holder which fits a sharpie fine point pen wonderfully the id holder is fantastic because it is easy to whip out an id very quickly i attached a key ring and my house key to the middle of the wallet there 's a zippered purse that 's great for loose change and a slot to hold paper bills one panel has a large pocket to hold boarding pass/receipt and a small pocket to hold business cards the only feature i do n't currently use is the sim card slot the wallet is big enough to hold all the above items but small enough that it fits into the outside pocket of my backpack i 'm a student in case you ca n't tell i love love love this wallet so much — bex get it from amazon for 12.99+ available in 36 colors share on facebook share on pinterest share on pinterest share on email share on copy promising review great material

facebook share on pinterest share on pinterest share on email share on copy promising review i travel often for work and it s so much easier to pack a few pocket palettes than tote my regular makeup — they re super carry-on bag/airport-friendly i love my lancôme but i d much rather not tote around heavy glass bottles so i keep a palette at the ready for the gym in my purse at my desk at work etc — they re that convenient for the makeup itself the quality of the bb cream is great it s light feels and looks natural you can get at least two full uses out of the quantity the lip/cheek color amount is also generous i personally go for a darker lip generally but this is good for blush and will last me a while i love how handy the mascara applicator is so fun-sized for someone on the go who is n't soooo makeup savvy that i 'm contouring all the time this product is really practical — maureen get a pack of three from amazon for 11.99 available in four shades find more tsa-friendly travel products share on facebook share on pinterest share on pinterest share on email share on copy promising review i purchased this to make cold brew coffee at the office my coworkers and i were going to the local siren at least three to four times a week for our afternoon pick me up it was starting to become a serious drain financially we all chipped in to get this pitcher and take turns buying beans get them ground for a french press or super coarse and you 'll have a pretty good replica the instructions for making cold brew are pretty easy of course you 'll get some micro grinds that will make their way through the filter but that 's to be expected if you 're ocd about it you could pour it through a strainer or paper filter or just let it settle and pour gently we 've seriously cut down our caffeine expenditures by 50-75 now if we could figure out a way to order out less — dt get it from amazon for 16.99 share on facebook share on pinterest share on pinterest share on email share on copy
