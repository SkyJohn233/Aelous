all ofthem but the contentis the same if there was any information being passed back and forth it hasbeen included back to askbuddy ask buddy archives 1 2 3 from tom stolaski date 04 mar 2002 when your are playing in what you call pockets are you thinking interms of major or minor scales or is it a mode thing from buddy date 05 mar 2002 pockets are locations on the fretboard containing notes that relate to a certainchord but not necessary exclusive to one chord one c6 pocket of this type usesstrings one through nine on the seventh fret and covers c c minor seven flatfive d7 e minor e 7 9 a minor or a7th chords some are easily adaptable toscale notes and some are modal but i generally think of pockets as points ofreference from tommy dodd date 05 mar 2002 buddy when i saw you a few years back with the everlys i think you were using alexicon mpx1 for reverb and delay can you tell me your opinions of that unitcompared to todays multi-effect units out and if you still use the lexicon forsessions/gigs thanks and we miss you out there tommy d./hotlanta ga from buddy date 06 mar 2002 the mpx-1 does n't have the warmth of other units because of its lack of an eq inthe system if anything it adds an annoying edge on the high end it 's a greatpiece of equipment but probably works best in an effects loop i 'm no longerdoing sessions or gigs of any kind except for johnny bush this coming saturdaynight and that 's because it was hard to turn down an ex cherokee band member.good hearing from you tommy from buddy date 14 mar 2002 tommy the unit i was referring in my initial reply is a lexicon reverb/delayprocessor i purchased before the mpx1 i do like the mpx1and am still using it.it has several effects pitch type effects such as panning chorus flanger phaser rotary cabinet etc. but the memory does n't allow as many combinationsas some other multi effect units in spite of that it 's a premier piece ofequipment with the three features most important to me clean reverbs delays and eq system my apologies for the error from stretch date 05 mar 2002 hi e. just wondering how often it would occur for you when playing that youwould find yourself in the zone you know that special place where when it 's over you say to yourself i do n't know how i did that but iknow it was good i 'm sure you know what i mean cheers stretch from buddy date 07 mar 2002 it 's a once in a great while experience and takes a lot of variables comingtogether at the same time but when it happens i can do no wrong i thinkyou 've been there too but if it 's any consolation it does n't come any easierfor me from bobby lee date 05 mar 2002 hi buddy i was wondering if you ever experimented with scale tunings what doyou think of the idea of having a full diatonic scale across the strings thanksernie for the great site -b0b- from buddy date 06 mar 2002 the closest i ever got was with a g tuning i used on one song in an old jeanniesealy album from the top the notes were g f e d b a g f d g. scales arpeggios and two note intervals worked well but it was awkward playing triadson the first fourth and fifth strings i liked it for recording because it wentto tape exceptionally well and every note was clean and almost effortless toplay on any part of the neck from bob carlson date 06 mar 2002 hi buddy about six months ago i started just using a tempered tuning and now iwonder why i did n't four years ago i use the one that came with the emmonsguitar do you use a tempered tuning thank you buddy bob from buddy date 07 mar 2002 i tempered my tuning until 1985 since then i 've been using equal temperedtuning or as equal as the physics of the guitar will allow from bill sutton date 06 mar 2002 i want to learn how to play the c6 i already have your basic c6 course but i don tunderstand the nashville number system are there any way you can help me pleasedesperate thank you from buddy date 07 mar 2002 each number represents a chord if you 're in the key of c the c chord is 1 thed chord is 2 e is 3 f is 4 g is 5 a is 6 and b is 7 a song like yourcheatin heart in c has two bars of c two of f two of g and back to c for twobars in number form it would read 1 1 4 4 5 5 1 1 when sharps or flats areinvolved such as bb you write a 7 and add a b behind it and it will read 7b.a minor chord would be a number followed with a dash and would read 2- theadvantage of the number system is that you can use numbers 1 through 7 torepresent any key so the above numbers would apply to e a or any other key.it can get more complicated and would take a lot of space to explain but theseare the basics from dennis detweiler date 07 mar 2002 buddy do you remember your approximate settings on the old session 400 amp i 'm especially interested in your mid and shift settings thanks dennis from buddy date 07 mar 2002 on my original session 400 the mid was 10 o'clock and the shift two o'clock from larry behm date 07 mar 2002 buddy i have a 66 pp with 13k pickups in it would this be original equipment was there a standard i have seen 13 's 16 's 18.5 etc from buddy date 07 mar 2002 it 's probably an original pickup for some reason i always thought i had 16s onthe guitar i used for the touch my heart album but i would n't be surprised tofind out they were 13s i sold the guitar to dickie overby so he would be theonly person that would know but i doubt that he ever measured them there werestandards but they changed when a few of the players and the emmons companystarted fixing things that were n't broke from bobby r boggs date 07 mar 2002 buddy there 's and effect you use on many of the swing tunes that you and raycut this is a rich fat kinda velvety sound a good example is the tunes'wonderful i 'm trying to write a patch that will match what you used so fari 've added chorus and pitch shift set for tonic of course to the rv and dl iknow you used a different processor i 'm using a roland gp-100.i 'm i on thewrong road by trying to use the pitch shift thank you buddy for your time alsothanks to ernie for a great site bb from buddy date 07 mar 2002 bobby there was no special effect on the steel sound other than eq i used aderby guitar on the album which is a bit darker in the mid range so that mayaccount for the fatter sound after listening to it it sounds like i boostedthe presence to help cut through the mids from frank estes date 07 mar 2002 buddy how are you preparing for this saturday night gig i assume you are givena list of songs in advance and maybe a tape or cd thank you from buddy date 07 mar 2002 i did get a tape and play list but i have n't played in six months so it 's goingto be a crap shoot looks like i picked a hell of a time to test the water from gary morrison date 07 mar 2002 buddy in the mid 60 's did you ever place finger picks on the rods of yourguitars from buddy date 07 mar 2002 that is an affirmative from dave birkett date 07 mar 2002 buddy how long does it take you to get a new set of finger picks to feel right thanks from buddy date 08 mar 2002 i have more of a problem with the pick surface than i have adjusting to the bandaround the finger i just shaped a new set of old style national finger pickslast night and in a minute or so they were feeling good the old style pickshave a contoured dish in them that offers a more uniform surface against thestrings the new ones are almost flat and have a scraping feel if your fingersare not perpendicular to the strings or at least they feel that way to me myhand sets at an angle so the contoured dish works best from larry miller date 07 mar 2002 what guitar and amp did you use to record this album did the band rehearsebefore putting it to tape how did the new york musicians take to the sound ofthe steel guitar bluemmons is my favorite thanks larry from buddy date 08 mar 2002 i used a sho~bud guitar and a standel amp with a twelve-inch speaker we ran thetunes down to get familiar with them before going to tape the musicians didn'tknow what to think about the pedal steel as most of them had never seen onebefore i recall them filing by and looking at it as if it were some sort ofrelic in an antique store i did n't bring charts to the session and when we ranout of tunes everybody knew i made up a blues melody off the top of my head werecorded it and i named it bluemmons from dirk b date 11 mar 2002 buddy the liner notes to your steel guitar jazz album suggest that you wereunhappy or uncomfortable with the recording circumstances but if so it doesn'tcome across on tape if your ride on cherokee was not recorded underoptimal circumstances i ca n't imagine how much better you would have played ifyou were really comfortable if you wish to do so could you perhaps talk a bitmore about the session how did you feel while playing how was the interactionwith the other players etc. from buddy date 11 mar 2002 my discomfort was through a series of small events i had planned to flycommercial but ray price was making a trip to new york city and offered to takeme in his small plane he said to travel light so i took a standel amp with a12 speaker when i set up i could n't find a warm sound for chords withoutdistorting the amp so i ended up with ear splitting highs i made it clear toquincy jones up front that i knew nothing about reading music and could n't dothe album if it required it so i called off the list of tunes he had sent meand found the musicians were n't familiar with the changes to some of them so wehad to come up with tunes we all knew also quincy had to fly to paris and theysubbed a producer by the name of hal mooney i felt that had quincy been there he could have supplied charts that would have gotten me through the tunes i hadtaken time to learn hal mooney was a producer and was married to kay starr atsome time but that was about the only thing i respected him for he got hotunder the collar and said why in the hell do n't you have charts for thesetunes. my response was these tunes were picked for me why in thehell did n't you hire somebody that knew them. because of that and a fewother things including it being my first exposure to the city and its attitude i was ready to go home the first hour i knew when we came to the tune anytime we had scraped the bottom of the barrel it was after any time thati came up with bluemmons and put us all out of our misery i got along well withart davis and bobby scott and if it was n't for bobby 's consideration i mighthave eased over the edge from dirk b date 11 mar 2002 i 'm not sure how to ask this but were the other musicians respectful andimpressed with you it 's hard to imagine them not taking notice of the boy fromindiana who could play the hell out of that contraption despite thecircumstances from buddy date 11 mar 2002 jerome richardson was fairly receptive to what was going on but charlie persipwas a bit on the cool side i guess if i had played drums for dizzy gillespie iwould have been cool too knowing he worked with dizzy did n't make thingsany easier from carlton day date 07 mar 2002 buddy my sho~bud ldg emits a slight 3rd string buzz on 1st fret did n't noticemy pp emmons doing that if i bear down on the bar the chord is a bit sharp isthere a shallower grooved nut roller for use on the 3rd thanks forany advice you may offer from buddy date 08 mar 2002 there 's a remote possibility a shallower nut roller can be found but being onthe third string it 's unlikely sho~bud would offer it i do n't know abouttoday but most manufactures used to use the same depth in the nut up to a pointand then increase it for the wound strings if that still applies this may be ajob for a machinist from cecil ouderkirk date 09 mar 2002 buddy what tuning did you use on the ernest tubb tune i cried a tear i thinkit was 1959 good luck to night have fun i m going too be listing wouldn tmiss it for the world sorry about your wrist hope it will get better cecil from buddy date 09 mar 2002 it was the e9th tuning from dirk b date 11 mar 2002 i have been trying to learn jazz on pedal steel for a couple of years and havebumped up my practice time to almost 2 hrs/day but it is clearly a longrow to hoe. how many hours did you play/practice when you were a teenagerand a young man i imagine the young buddy emmons sitting down at the guitar allday and into the night until you nailed the runs you were trying for breaking only for food water maybe the occasional beer what kind of non-performing hours did you put in as a young player from buddy date 11 mar 2002 you pretty much covered my early practice days i do n't recall what i did duringthe non-practice times except bicycle over to mishawaka a nearby town andstand outside a couple of bars and listen to the bands in other words if iwas n't playing i was listening i later found that the best way to keep frombecoming frustrated was to tape for better or for worse my first attempt atsomething i wanted to learn then when i felt i was getting nowhere i 'd playthe tape back and be pleasantly surprised at the progress i had made fromthere i taped each progression for comparison it kept me from throwing thetowel in several times from ernie hagar date 11 mar 2002 it s ironic that taping kept you from throwing in the towel. taping your playing makes many players want to throw in the towel from buddy date 11 mar 2002 thanks ernie that 's the nicest thing i 've heard all day i just liked this one from sam minnitti date 11 mar 2002 hello buddy you are so kind to provide such thoughtful answers to all thequestions you get asked mine is regarding your beautifully lush sound that youused on your studio recording of blue eyes do you recall what your setup wasfor that date also was that in c6 or e9 most sincerely sam minnitti nyc from buddy date 11 mar 2002 the steel was a sierra using a slight detune effect and recorded direct from myrack to the console from sam minnitti date 11 mar 2002 buddy thank you so much for your reply that is very interesting that a detuneeffect was used would it be too pushy for me to ask what other effects made upyour rack at the time that would have contributed to the lushness i wouldthink reverb and maybe delay respectfully sam minnitti from buddy date 11 mar 2002 i used a combination of delay and the slight low level detune effect any reverbwould have been added during the mixdown from dennis detweiler date 11 mar 2002 on nearly every amp especially the old 400s each tone control seems to have abreaking point a spot that the control/tone breaks drastically withing aneight inch sweep left or right from that point do you usually break left orright of that mark eg..on the old 400s the mid seems to break around 8 or 9o'clock shift around noon bass around 3 o'clock etc i have two 400s and bothare identical in this respect maybe i 'm nuts also you are and always will betop dog seems like there 's this gap between you and everyone under it no oneever bridges that space no matter how hard they try many try to do it withspeed like ramping that space and end up with broken bones nice liftoffthough from buddy date 12 mar 2002 it 's been a while since i 've played through an old session but on the lateramps the mid and shift controls at 12 o'clock represent a flat setting you canmove the shift when the mid is flat and not hear much difference in the sound.it 's only when you move the mid control first that you see a more pronouncedchange in the shift because you 're shifting frequencies at the cut or boostedmid positions where you set the mids will determine to what degree the shiftaffects them so i always leave the shift flat set the mids and then thickenthem up a bit with the shift by turning it to the right from there i use theplus or minus side of each control to fine tune for the warmth i 'm looking for.for the bass control i set it just beyond the breaking point but not enough tomake the bottom end too woofy i used a new setting on the midnight jamboree march 9th that had the mid at around 9 o'clock and the shift at 3 o'clock buti was using a matchbox that thins the high mids out considerably without it the sound would have been too dark or muddy i 'll be listening to the archive ofthe show to see how it went to tape i liked the part about the liftoff from john swain date 11 mar 2002 buddy in one of your swing tab books your copedant has both cs onc6 pulling to c on rkr this with pedal 5 makes a nice 6th inversion you don'toften do this so what are the cons thanks js from buddy date 12 mar 2002 i had the single c raise on the top only for a while but have recently added itto the bottom the one and only con regarding the double raise which is an oldtheory i had is that raising the bottom c when using it with pedal five interfered with the 5th note of the ninth chord today i prefer the double raisebecause it extends the c6 chord to eight notes and is still compatible with the5th pedal the difference being that it 's now a ninth with an augmented 5th from carl johnson date 11 mar 2002 buddy how did your wrist hold up saturday night from buddy date 12 mar 2002 i played it reasonable safe and used a lot of the closer grips so there wasn'ttoo much discomfort there were a few clinkers though which i shall blame onbeing a bit gun shy from not having played in six months i 've developed a lazythumb so i 've got to get to work on that of course staring at fifty steelplayers in front of me had little to do with it now that i 've used all theexcuses i can think of to be totally honest with you i did much better than ithought i would from jeff coffell date 11 mar 2002 i 'm considering a new emmons legrande iii i 've been playing steel for about 18months took top gun from newman i have a zum now and love the feel but don'tlike the tone would you buy a new emmons i had a legrande ii and sold it bigmistake from buddy date 12 mar 2002 i have two legrande lll models i prefer the emmons push pull sound but find theadvantages of the all pull mechanism make up for the slight difference in thesound of the two guitars both models cut well i just bleed a bit more on thepush pull from sylo447 msn.com date 12 mar 2002 buddy we attended the midnite jamboree on march 9 when you appeared with jb wewere told by someone in the audience that you were considering giving up playingbased on your performance at the jamboree my husband plays steel and we havebeen avid fans of yours for 25 years and we are interested in how you feel aboutyour performance at the jamboree we sincerely hope that you are going tocontinue to play we drove down from illinois to nashville for the jamboree andit was well worth the trip down we would do it again in a heartbeat sincerelyfans from illinois from buddy date 12 mar 2002 i was n't all that happy with my performance but it 's normal for me to be tenseand hit a few clinkers when i have n't worked in a while it was that way withsessions and the same for the first day or two of an everly tour because wheni 'm not working i stop playing my pedal steel and do most of my practicing on a12-string guitar i do n't remember doing anything bad enough to warrant myheading for the hills so i 'll probably woodshed a bit more and continue toaccept those occasional jobs i feel i 'd be most comfortable playing iappreciate your sincerity and hope to see you next time from john swain date 12 mar 2002 i was told you field tested some carter d10s for bud which pus did you like forthe two necks and what pu did you decide on for the s12 you now have thx js from buddy date 12 mar 2002 i field tested two or three carter guitars but they all were equipped with thegeorge l e-66 pickup the company did send an extra pickup for my s-12 but ihave n't put it on because i 'm happy with the e-66 from c. day date 12 mar 2002 hi again buddy i saw a friend of mine today here in owensboro who said he wasat the jamboree sat nite and he said it looked like the first 4 rows were allwearing black derbys i wish i had been among em anyway he said you playedsuper well i told him about your hurting right wrist and he said no onewould 've ever known it i just thought you might like to know from buddy date 13 mar 2002 thanks to smiley roberts i looked up and saw fifty derby hats looking back atme and like to have lost it smiley is a long time friend who has expressed hisfriendship to me in many different ways over the years but i must say he peggedthe meter saturday night please thank your friend for me for helping makesaturday night one that i 'll never
