Kingsley Specialist Roofing trainees | Kingsley Specialist Roofing At Kingsley Specialist Roofing Ltd we are keen to nurture and develop new skills amongst our workforce. We have been working closely with Northbrook College to bring on new trainees who have been working on a number of projects. We have had several trainees working with our division recently, they were an integral part of the team who installed the copper roof on the Worthing Splashpoint swimming pool. We also have trainees working with our repair teams, learning the ins and outs of traditional roofing disciplines. A career in roofing can prove very rewarding and we are happy to hear from motivated, hard working individuals who are interested in earning money whilst learning a valuable trade.
