Will Kimura and Aoki become champions? : hajimenoippo This is something I &# x27;ve been wondering about for awhile now and I &# x27;m not sure if this will happen, at least not to Kimura. They &# x27;ve been building to Aoki v. Iga II and we know that at least that match will happen with the small possibility of Aoki winning but it seems like Kimura is just lost and has been for awhile. I &# x27;d love it if both of them won a belt, but right now the only one of the two of them I could see as champion is Aoki. He &# x27;s got a set goal and a new found drive to keep fighting while Kimura barely has a reason to keep boxing, struggles with weight control and doesn &# x27;t even try to win anymore. Unless Kimura finds a legitimate reason to actually try and fight for the title, I think Mori should retire him. It sucks because he &# x27;s such a skilled fighter, as seen in the Mashiba fight years ago and the that he fought a national champion to a draw on two separate occasions, and is a really likable guy but right now he &# x27;s just kind of useless. That being said there &# x27;s a good chance Aoki won &# x27;t win the belt either. He &# x27;s stepped up his game and is taking boxing more seriously now more than ever, but he &# x27;s not a capable enough fighter to take down Iga. He got destroyed in their last encounter and Iga &# x27;s gotten a lot stronger since then. Whether either guy wins a belt though is still up in the air but I think we can all agree they probably should have held the belt by now. The common belief is that Aoki will be retired by Iga and that will lead to Kimura moving up a weight class to avenge him.  It was stated on a few occasions that Kimura has been fighting below his natural weight anyway, and that is what has been holding him back from his full potential. I &# x27;ve read this theory before but I &# x27;m really on the fence about it. I do believe it makes a lot of sense story wise but it does have some flaws regarding Kimura. He basically acknowledged that Aoki chose Iga to retire him and flat out stated that he &# x27;d stick with him until then. If that &# x27;s how Kimura truly feels, then there &# x27;s really no reason for him to move up after Apki does retire. That being said, if Aoki does somehow win against Iga, I don &# x27;t really know where he &# x27;d go from there. But this may be me talking nonsense, and Kimura may move up if Aoki gets serious injured against Iga. It &# x27;s a possibility. Aoki &# x27;s EoS fight is probably gonna be against Iga. I think he &# x27;s gonna win just so Maron can lose. Kimura on the other hand seems like a mystery. Especially with the recent introduction of the Regular. He may be Kimura &# x27;s EoS fight. Atleast that &# x27;s the feeling I am getting from him trying to cheer Kimura up. They probably know eachother I would personaly love to see both Kimura and Aoki become champions and retire but I am also ready for both of them to just retire without getting the belt. I feel like the opposite is gonna happen, while Kimura has been sort of lost as of late I feel like he is gonna bounce back and Aoki is going to be the one to retire b/c of them hyping him up. While I &# x27;d love it if they both got belts, I feel more like one of them is gonna be forced into retirement and that &# x27;s going to push the other to steel their resolve more. If Kimura could fight in his natural class, Lightweight, yes, he could. Which is probably going to happen after Iga retires Aoki. I think it was Miyata himself who said Kimura &# x27;s abilities are beyond the national level. As for Aoki, everyone on this subreddit has a better chance of getting the title ;) Both are generally treated as joke characters in the majority of the fights, heck, half their fights are skipped over and just the final punch shown with some exceptions and serious matches here and there. They also have a pretty bad win-loss record (It even got pointed out that Aoki ended deadlast in his first A-Tournament) So I doubt either will ever get a belt. There is also the fact that most of the Aokimaru vs Takamaru jokes stem from him calling them losers and mocking them. I doubt that running gag will ever be abandoned Not to mention their gym ending up with 3 regional and 7 worldtitle belts spread out over 5 fighters in the end if everyone achieved their goals would be a bit ridiculous, especially when Kimura and Aoki have always been portrayed as the  " average "  members of the gym the thing about both these characters is that at the end of the day, there the only realistic boxers. (in a manga full of OP characters) they &# x27;re supposed to represent the average joe struggling to compete in a field they love, even though there just average. i always see people complaining about how there just comic relief but honestly their matches are more sad then any thing. and who cant relate? in every field (art, science, business, etc) sometimes it doesn &# x27;t matter how much you love something, sometimes your just average. and in an interview segments/extra a fan asked george to pls let kimura win a match and he said  " no, hes weak " . i dont see them winning any belts and thats how life is sometimes 17.8k Members 185 Online Mar 22, 2012 Cake Day
