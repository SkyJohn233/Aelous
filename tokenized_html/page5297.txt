subscribe to independent premium jungle jungle xl west london s jungle emerged shrouded in mystery last year brewing an alluring mix of stylish videos and silky future-soul pop-art perhaps founding members j and t enigmatic see should have cultivated the mystique some more because their heat-haze hybrid of soul grooves and falsetto-funk chic feels too under-cooked to sustain a whole album at best on the vibrant busy earnin and the tears for fears-go-tropical undulations of accelerate they combine summery uplift with a reflective tug dancing against the downturn when the tunes and the tension thin out too much here dissolves into a vague chill-out-zone drift destined to be heard – if rarely remembered – at w10 barbecues near you sharing the full story not just the headlines **** kh levon helm band midnight ramble sessions vol 3 vanguard the late and utterly great drummer/vocalist of the band habituated himself in his dwindling years to staging midnight rambles in his barn in woodstock tailored jams in which levon s coterie of excellent homie musos would cook up tasty morsels from the r b/gospel canon in the company of eminent guests elvis costello chris robinson and allen toussaint grace this volume yet it is not the stars not even brian mitchell who sounds remarkably like bob dylan but the collective vibe which signifies in this barn songs by willie dixon sam cooke al green dylan voices horns drums mandolins guitars and that curious energy you get when people are doing what they love best in the world **** nick coleman bill laurance flint groundup the debut album by snarky puppy pianist laurance who once played with morcheeba recalls the cinematic orchestra or ltj bukem on post-rave anthems where strings horns and keyboards intertwine amid a real composer s

with laurance s ragtime-meets-minimalism piano style outstanding **** phil johnson noura mint seymali tzenni glitterbeat on the album s cover this mauritanian muslim has what can only be described as a mischievous smile happily spirited appearances are supported by the bluesy bounce of the music tzenni actually means to spin and that s precisely what seymali does to one s sensibilities by in turn warbling roaring and trilling songs about earthly love spiritual love fate and food the only slight letdown is that the band – a largely traditional rock line-up of bass guitar and kit drum apart from

are depressingly familiar and what s this the wicker man getting fresh with nancy sinatra guardian guide here we go again then in fact gulp is a group formed around super furry animal guto pryce and his partner lindsey leven and season sun is their attempt to make a sunshine pop record have they succeeded in a way – this is light and breezy pop that marries summery synths with dreamy female vocals think i monster s daydream in blue which sadly for gulp was such a great pop-folk-electronica moment that season sun never quite emerges from its shadow **** simmy richman the best in film
