wonderful memories from this tournament winning in kolkata was definitely the best memory… not just winning but winning for the west indies that s special i ve won other titles before but winning that trophy for the people of the west indies was amazing what made it even more amazing was the fact that the under-19 men won their world cup a few months earlier and the men s team won on the same day we did for us you could see the progression from going to semi-final to semi-final climbing the mountain 2010 2012 2014 so winning in india was like reaching the mountaintop this is a modal window

and not get too much ahead of ourselves we have to concentrate on how we want to play as a team we know that the caribbean is zooming in because they want to see great things and we want to do great things for the caribbean it is important that we keep focused on what is required on the field and remain relaxed off the field the game has evolved a lot since i started as a 16-year-old the players are more classy and with more finesse you see switch-hitting reverse sweeps…it comprises so many new things the players are definitely fitter and very athletic the fielding standards have improved tremendously it is amazing we have fast bowlers like katherine brunt who is among the quickest and you also have players like elyse perry who is an excellent bowler and all-rounder in our side we have shamilia connell who is our fastest she has matured and knows her game and it s really good to see that someone who we have been grooming now understands her game fully and can get wickets for us from when we started back in may with the special camps organized by cricket west indies here in antigua the management the coach the trainer have been pushing the players to improve fitness and skills and i have seen tremendous improvement i have seen a whole different level of fitness and you could see it when we played against south africa in the recent odis and t20is the century by hayley matthews in barbados in the fifth odi was stunning it was beautiful to be at the other end batting with her and to witness that kind of performance anisa mohammed took a hat-trick in the t20is and she continues to lead from the front she started way back i believe at age 15 now she is one of the senior players when you look at players getting older that s more experience and you tap into that experience and maturity out there in the middle that s what she offers the team a level head a focused individual who can make the right decisions under pressure this is a modal window this is a modal
