Great little designer shop! - Review of Encore Consignment Boutique, Chattanooga, TN - TripAdvisor A little shop with LOTS of designer treasures. The items I looked at (wallets and handbags) were nice and well priced for authentic, vintage pieces (Louis Vuitton, Coach, etc). The shop is a bit small and feels really cramped, but they have great designer pieces with good prices. The staff is VERY friendly and quite helpful! I enjoyed my visit and I will return!
