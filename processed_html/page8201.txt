What is a Travel Plan? We use cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website. A  Travel Plan (formerly referred to as a Green Travel Plan) is a series of  initiatives or measures devised in such a way so as to achieve the objectives  or aims of a workplace, school, or other organisation to encourage safe,  healthy and sustainable travel options. Typically the aim is to restrain travel  by car which can free up car parking space, make a positive contribution to the community and environment and help to reduce the number of cars on the road and  hence emissions, delay and congestion. Every Travel Plan is different and  bespoke to the purpose for which it is written, but most travel plans follow a  structured process in their development.  A  Travel Plan will normally include:  A  Travel Plan is a dynamic document and it is part of the  Travel Plan  Coordinator's role  to administer and carry out the annual  travel plan survey  and to devise with the Local Planning Authority, or its Travelwise team, the  most appropriate measures to be included in the Annual Action Plan to achieve  or retain targets for the various modes of travel.                 Although  Travel Plans originally related to major employment sites this situation has  now extended into all forms of development. We have extensive experience in  producing travel plans for all types of development including: Where  an  end user  or  users  is not known a Travel Plan Framework is produced which  sets out the above but in a format which will be used to devise subsequent individual plans for each element of the development. Once  approved by the Local Planning Authority the implementation of the Travel Plan  necessitates the appointment of a Travel Plan Coordinator. Where appropriate  this role is often taken in house by a member of staff employed at the  development but with large scale mixed use or residential schemes the role of  Travel Plan Coordinator is usually assigned to a specialist provider. Sanderson  Associates has extensive experience in acting as a Travel Plan Coordinator and  have recently acted (or are currently acting) as Travel Plan Coordinators in a  number of large scale developments some examples being: We would be delighted to provide you with our competitive fee proposal  to provide you with a Travel Plan, or for you to appoint us as your Travel Plan Coordinator, please call us on 01924 844080 or  click here to complete our secure online form .
