wealth and financial independence/retire early hot hot this sub is for people pursuing financial independence and/or early retirement with a great lifestyle this is the opposite of the leanfire model to get out of work life asap you can achieve financial independence and early retirement without compromising your lifestyle this requires a larger nest egg than a typical leanfire or fire goal on this sub we choose both abundance and sustainability no judgement everyone decides for himself/herself what is enough in life if you x27 re shooting for the stars and op is shooting for the edge of the universe just shrug and ask why not be courteous and positive so no insults and harassment including calling out liars or gurus use the report button instead text posts only you can link to outside resources from within your post stick to quality posts discussions specific to the fatfire pursuit and lifestyle this means no how-to start inspiration or other basic posts disclaimer i don x27 t think i x27 ve discovered something that you all don x27 t already know i x27 m looking for someone to tell me what i x27 m missing can someone patiently explain maybe eli5 to me why everyone wouldn x27 t automatically do real estate as their investment i can understand not investing in real estate for the following reasons 5mm cash to invest if i had 5mm to get even 5 reliably i wouldn x27 t bother with the headache of real estate no time not everyone has the luxury to spare a few hours here and there retiring imminently if your house value drops 40 next year that x27 ll hurt if you x27 re 65 if you x27 re 30 you can wait it out assuming you didn x27 t buy into a bubble you can get a better roi for your time elsewhere i x27 m a newbie re investor a couple years in with a few properties but with very little down payment i can leverage large purchases and have them paid down by tenants yes its a bit more work than an etf but my 15-30k assuming you can do 5-10 down can get me a 300k asset under my control that gives me tax write offs appreciation rent increases and loan pay down lets say i have 20k of extra headache for any incidentals before it is financially essentially self sufficient if not cash-flowing yes i am counting my few hours a month of coordinating maintenance and finding new tenants as x27 free labor x27 but you can quantify it if you like and i x27 m still missing why you wouldn x27 t do this unless you meet one of the aforementioned criteria as a summary my 30k 20k 50k got me 300k asset appreciating at 5-10 per year after 10 years my asset is worth 479k assuming the depressing 4.7 return from forbes 545k assuming 6 appreciation lets just make a huge under-assumption and say i have 479k purchase price 300k 179k of value in equity tax reduction by tens of thousands per year with depreciation and interest cash flow of lets say 150 per month 104 rent increase estimate per year when the ltv gets to be 50 i can refinance to draw the cash out tax-free to replay this game multiple times over all any opinions on real estate vs. stocks for young europeans i feel swayed by the leverage re can give me but it is significant illiquid money in a hot market regardless even with a ~1 cap gain through housing prices this method significantly outperforms the average stock market performance over a 5-7 period assuming 85-90 leverage vs. 5-7 performance on the stock market my cashflow can handle vacancy as well as any one-off maintenance costs and have high job stability high finance type job i x27 d outsource all landlord issues to a 3rd party that x27 s common here to do as it gives you a tax benefit strongly struggling with the question and if i x27 m missing anything any opinions advice thanks in advance for those who don t know portugal italy greece and spain offer permanent residence path through investments about 500k euro or less once you obtain the visa you are eligible for their public healthcare and travel all over schengen area i start paying attention because i have grown increasingly worried about how expensive healthcare in america is i d say 500k euro is very doable for folks in this sub any opinions about this matter hey gang you re the group i trust most to know the right places to go to ensure my family are safe and comfortable during a 18-24 month relocation abroad like the title says i m moving to singapore on a company sponsored program i m an executive covering about a third of one of our tier 1 p l s globally i ll still be traveling a fair bit so my family will need to be comfortable and have a community for support can anyone recommend something particularly an online community my wife can participate in to build some confidence before we take the plunge thanks cd hi there happy holidays to all has anyone used or recommend a concierge travel service that will facilitate transportation /booking activities general itinerary while abroad i m looking for help with the logistics and especially in countries that are trickier to travel to it doesn t have to be super detailed just some help /general guidance i know morgan stanley and some other investment banks offer this but i m wondering if there s something a little more niche that just does travel as opposed to it being part of a full advisory offering i found a vacation home two hours from my home close to where i grew up has acreage 5 trees i love trees and privacy house is 20 years old in good shape i want to buy it as a vacation property for me i am 63 years old single no kids here are the facts my net worth is 4,000,000 1.25 million in cd x27 s at 2.7 to 3 1 million in in bonds 250,000 in stock index fund 150,000 individual stocks 500,000 in bond funds the rest in treasury money markets and cash i think it would be a good addition for diversification but i am retired so my portfolio has to sustain my lifestyle i currently spend around 70,000 a year any thoughts on whether this is a stupid idea are appreciated we had spent roughly 60k a year and planned on fire once 1.5m was saved in investable assets i started a side business to expedite our fi date it x27 s been a lot more work that i x27 ve anticipated but i finally found the entrepreneurial fulfillment i didn x27 t know i was looking for this is an e-com business and due to the holiday season for the first time ever i made more money in a month from my side-business than from my 9-5 job i understand things will slow as the business is seasonal but this got me thinking should i just quit now i found my passion but if i take the leap there is a risk of not hitting our fi number but if i x27 m able to spend my time on passion maybe that doesn x27 t matter anymore -questions i was hoping to find passion in my day-job but it hasn x27 t happened yet i like the people i work with but the work isn x27 t clicking with me still its not necessarily hard/stressful work and it seems like a big leap to walk away from a 120k/year fixed income still if i quit i x27 ll have more freedom to live the life i want to live to focus on myself my family and my business but my business is very vulnerable in a recessionâ€¦it x27 s discretionary products i sell if i leave the 120k/year job could we live off of my wife x27 s income without having to start drawdown or what is safe withdrawal rate we have to do to ensure our portfolio still grows over time is it worth dropping the high-pay job and put fi in jeopardy the original goal was to his the 1.5m first 3-5 years on current pay and then run my business basically risk free .but i dread going into the office and attending meetings when i could be doing more fulfilling things with my time what would you do in my situation what x27 s the risk what the reward curious to hear the community x27 s thoughts and opinions thanks age industry location 55.3k members 158 online nov 28 2016 cake day
