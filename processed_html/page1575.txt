Listen ABC Radio - Conversations Leigh had been a reporter for over two decades when a string of bad news stories coincided with a terrifying brush with her own mortality. She began searching for answers about how people cope when indiscriminate tragedy strikes their lives. Leigh spoke to people who have faced the unimaginable: from terrorism, to natural disaster, to the unexpected loss of a loved one. Instead of a list of broken people, she found many of them possessed deep reserves of strength, hope and humour. She also delved into new research on how the brain processes grief, and whether post-traumatic growth is possible. Leigh found that life is richer and safer than most stories on the news would have you believe.
