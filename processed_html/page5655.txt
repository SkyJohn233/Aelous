About Us We help clients prepare for a transition - prepare for change.  While transitions present the opportunity for growth, adventure and challenge, it requires the individual to "let go" of what is familiar in order to move forward.  We realise that this is a difficult process of leaving what is familiar and dealing with an unfamiliar space that does not fit comfortably in your current needs.
