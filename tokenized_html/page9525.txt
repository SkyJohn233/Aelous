burning sugar cube chemistry experiments mel practicum you can not set a sugar cube on fire but it will burn if you add ash scientific name burning of sugar cube with ash as a catalyst by mel science by colin mckay by hustfloyd by sven sommer by простая наука by holmanova navruza wear eye protection throughout during the experiment have a bowl of water nearby put a solid fuel burner from the startet kit on a tray do not touch the burner after the experiment wait until it gets cold always follow general safety recommendations please note that conducting chemistry experiments you must comply with the relevant legal procedures in your country we have found this experiment in the mel chemistry database.you can subscribe to it s service and recieve everything for this experiment by mail usually sugar doesn t burn add ashes to set it on fire c 12 h 22 o 11 12o 2 ash → 12co 2 11h 2 o why do some substances burn while others do not let 's first look into the process of burning and what it exactly is burning is the reaction of oxidation of a substance by oxygen oxygen takes away electrons from a substance breaks the bonds between atoms puts itself into molecules and turns a substance into a mixture of oxides the difference between burning and other oxidation reactions e.g iron corrosion is that during burning a large amount of heat is released 2 conditions must be carried out for a substance to burn when it is oxidized a large amount of heat must be released enough to sustain burningthe oxidation reaction go quite fastwhy does n't a piece of sugar burn the oxidation of sugar is capable of releasing enough heat it 's easy to remember if you look at a pack of cookies and its calorie capacity the amount of calories in food is the heat generated during its oxidation in the body however the oxidation of sugar is quite slow so sugar does not burn why does sugar start to burn when you add ashes in the burning of sugar ashes serve as an accelerator catalyst of the reaction a catalyst is a substance that makes reactions which theoretically should occur but in practice are too slow possible in the real world imagine that you are on a valley and you need to go down to the sea but a mountain range has grown on your way to go straight through the mountains is one way it is long and difficult it is a whole other thing to find a guide who knows the path through a narrow pass and can take you directly to the sea through this narrow hidden pass without tedious and dangerous climbs that is the role that a catalyst plays it allows a chemical reaction to find a way to a more favorable state spending minimal strength energy on the road usually in nature a more favorable state means a state with minimum energy what are ashes what are they made of ashes are substances that can not continue to burn be oxidized this means that ashes may consist of salts or oxides ashes contain metal carbonates salts of carbonic acid h2co3 these exact substances act as catalysts accelerators of the sugar burning reaction the best catalysts are lithium salts which are found for example in cigarette ashes however plain paper ashes which contain sodium and calcium salts may also catalyze the combustion of sugar what is the result of burning sugar if sugar burns through to the end the result of combustion should turn out to be carbon dioxide co2 however in reality sugar does not fully down down and a black mass of products of incomplete oxidation of sugar complex organic substances aldehydes ketones carboxylic acids are left after it published on 21 august 2014 © mel science 2015 – 2016 anyone can edit mel practicum by adding new experiments or editing descriptions of existing experiments all edits are reviewed by professional chemists your feedback is highly appreciated feel free to send us an email support melscience.com or simply use the form provided
