kidman posted 16 november 2018 3:45 pm share share email twitter facebook whatsapp copy copied to clipboard news apple has thrown some amazing hardware and a useful redesign at the ipad pro 2018 range but the limitations of ios and its asking price mean that this is a tablet only for a small niche of users quick verdict the 2018 ipad pro is the most revolutionary upgrade apple 's made with the ipad line with superb performance great battery life and a much welcomed shift to usb c. however the underlying ios architecture limits what you can do with all that power and peripheral support is still a bit sketchy at the asking price most users would be well served with the regular ipad apple s contention for its ipad pro lines has long been that they are not mere consumption devices but instead fully professional tools with the ipad pro 2018 it s closer than it s ever been before in terms of hardware but the inbuilt limitations and controls on ios make for an experience that s still just as much frustrating as it is fabulous the design of the ipad pro has also undergone some quite significant changes although some of them almost make it seem like a throwback device where ipad design has tended to mirror iphone design to an extent with ever more slender profiles apple s instead gone back to the design documents for the original slightly more bulky ipad to produce the ipad pro the end result is a device that measures in at either 247.6 x 178.5 x 5.9mm for the 11 inch ipad pro or 280.6 x 214.9 x 5.9mm for the 12.9 inch variant which is what i 've tested with either way it 's less curved than last year s model with squarer sides but that 's not a bad thing per se for what is after all meant to be a laptop replacement it draws a distinct professional line between the ipad pro and ipad lines if nothing else the other major change is of course that this is the first ipad model of any type not to use apple s own proprietary plug standard we ve gone from the 30-pin dock connector to the lightning connector and apple has now settled on using the open usb c plug standard for both charging and peripheral connectivity it makes it easier to connect up an ipad pro to a macbook pro although a little fiddlier for lightning-connected devices such as iphones and it does rather leave open whether apple will shift to usb c fully for next year 's phone models apple doesn t specify which usb c peripherals will work with the ipad pro however there s only the single usb c port so it s a question of either charging or using an external peripheral it s theoretically possible you may be able to use a usb-c connected dock and third parties may build similar for use with the ipad pro but it s also important to recognise that apple doesn t specify which usb c peripherals will work with the ipad pro so far there s no equivalent of the mfi certification for ipad pro usb c peripherals one feature you 'll have to do without is a headphone jack apple would dearly like you to buy some of those nice wireless beats headphones it spent so much money on or at least pony up for a usb-c to 3.5mm adaptor as with its 2018 iphone lines you 're not provided with one in the box which is annoying on a computer that apple charges a significant premium for the ipad pro also drops the touchid-enabled home button in favour of apple s own faceid platform this does leave apple with a lot more space for the 120hz capable lcd display it 's not quite bezel-free but compared to other ipad models the lack of touchid does give it the feel of having more screen space or in the case of the 12.9 inch model tested being smaller which it actually is so if you shifted from the old 12.9 inch ipad pro to the newer model you 'll be hefting around a smaller computer like apple s previous ipad pro displays the ipad pro lcd display is beautifully colour balanced but then apple intends for the ipad pro to become a platform for amongst other uses photoshop so accuracy is a must it 's also a really nice platform for watching netflix video thanks to the powerful array of speakers underneath the glass not that you 'd ever use a pro tool to relax on the weekend or at least not that you 'd tell your boss about anyway the apple pencil has also had a bit of an upgrade although this may not be a plus if you ve already got apple s stylus peripheral the new model charges wirelessly by magnetically attaching to the horizontal top of the ipad pro in a similar style to the way the surface pen attaches to a surface pro 6 got an old lightning connector apple pencil it won t even pair with the new ipad pro apple also charges that way so in theory your apple pencil should never go flat as long as the battery chemistry lasts the challenge with the new model is that it s totally incompatible with the old model got an old lightning connector apple pencil it won t even pair with the new ipad pro the reverse is true too so a new apple pencil is for the 2018 ipad pro lines only apple will continue to sell both types of apple pencil because the earlier 10.5 inch ipad pro is still available as is the apple pencil-compatible 2018 apple ipad and they both work with those earlier apple pencils it 's a problem if you wanted to upgrade everything but your apple pencil but also a fair warning to be careful when buying the apple pencil to ensure you get the correct model apple has also produced a new version of its keyboard case for use with the ipad pro again it s an extra you ll have to buy if you re keen on any kind of rapid typing it s a similar story to that of the surface pro 6 in that i can t see too many ipad pro buyers not opting for it i m not the biggest fan of most of apple s peripheral design decisions where all too often physical and usage considerations are secondary to design ideas – this is the company that gave us the no-button magic mouse after all – but it seems like the ipad pro keyboard design team snuck out under sir jony ive s watchful eye because it s easily the best apple keyboard i ve used in years there s a surprising amount of travel on each key and at least on the 12.9 inch variant i tested with a decent amount of space between keys you re not stuck with the woeful flattened keyboard found on new macbook pro models but instead something that s genuinely useful and feels like it should well and truly be able to take a battering over a span of time it s also nicely thin and of course it ll protect your investment in the ipad pro as well back to top the 2018 ipad pro runs on apple s a12x bionic a more powerful fork of the a12 bionic found in the apple iphone xs max apple iphone xs and apple iphone xr it s a very powerful processor and on the phones it very much felt like apple was sticking a heavy duty engine into a frame that didn t entirely need it because we re yet to see all that many phone-based apps that need that kind of grunt however on the ipad pro it s a different story because apple s support for multitasking and split screen apps means that you can push it a lot harder and indeed the entire point is that you should apps like adobe s photoshop are incoming and while i couldn t test with that for the purposes of review it s quite clear that the a12x bionic along with the specific optimisations that apple can bring in ios 12 makes for a formidable pairing it 's obviously somewhat app dependent but to give a partial picture here 's how the apple ipad pro 12.9 2018 using apple 's a12x bionic compared on geekbench 4 's cpu test against the a12 bionic found in apple 's 2018 iphone crop bear in mind that those phones leave their android counterparts behind by a significant margin in this test and you 'll get an idea just how much power the ipad pro is packing having said that the ipad pro is powerful in a comparison against more traditional laptop or desktops it does have a somewhat unfair advantage that is also a limitation photoshop or other heavy duty applications on a pc or mac runs as an instance of a program amongst many you can add additional applications running in the background and while your performance may suffer depending on how much memory you ve got it s a feasible approach to multi-tasking ios on the other hand takes an entirely controlled approach to how many applications are truly open at a time with many being effectively paused in the background instead of actual true multitasking yes you can run multiple apps with slide over and picture-in-picture modes on an ipad pro and that has productivity implications but it s nowhere near the range and scope of a desktop pc or mac against that apple can more easily leverage its ipad pro memory and processor capabilities simply because it won t let you do quite as much at once the shift to usb c is also a significant one for apple but it s also one where you have to take some guesswork as to whether a given peripheral will actually work or indeed be allowed to work apple is notably reluctant to allow storage expansion on ipad models so getting external drives to talk nicely to an ipad pro can be a bit of guesswork it s easier on a dslr for example but really only within photo apps there s no explicit guarantee that your usb c peripheral will work especially if it s designed to do something apple doesn t want you doing with an ipad pro the shift to usb c is also a significant one for apple but it s also one where you have to take some guesswork as to whether a given peripheral will actually work or indeed be allowed to work currently that s the single biggest strike against the ipad pro as a productivity system yes it s an expensive tablet especially at the highest storage capacity prices but like any productivity tool its value is entirely relative to how productive it s going to make you as a user there s very little wrong with the hardware as presented but the limitations within the operating system could still be a challenge and one that leaves a macbook pro or higher-end windows 10 machine as a smarter choice depending on your circumstances the ipad pro incorporates the faceid camera system first seen in the apple iphone x for unlocking and apple pay verification purposes the iphone xr provides apple 's latest processor and operating system in a package that 's more affordably priced than the iphone xs max one neat feature here is that it works in both portrait and landscape orientation although you do have to enrol your face in portrait mode unlocking is swift even in low light although there s no real speed advantage here as you re still going to have to swipe up the screen to unlock it in any case once you have to do that it 's no faster than tapping on a touchid button apple s claims for battery life on the ipad pro are that it should be capable of up to 10 hours of wi-fi usage or for watching video or music listening and just a little less than that a 9 hours of web surfing if you re using the lte-enabled model on a mobile data network battery usage on a tablet like this is always a heavily variable matter but my own anecdotal tests certainly back this up using the ipad pro as a personal productivity machine i m mostly a writer and to a fair extent the ipad pro is incredible overkill for most of my word creation needs as noted for some other applications i d probably shift to a full macbook pro but for portability and battery life the ipad pro is very good indeed the shift to usb c is also a welcome one from a power viewpoint although rather predictably the ipad pro is somewhat fussy as to whether it 'll take a charge from every single usb c power source however with the supplied 18w charger it 's a rapid process to top up the ipad pro 's battery apple has done a remarkable thing with the hardware for the ipad pro and it s a pretty clear sign of where it sees its mobile computing future it s easily the most exciting hardware it has put in a portable computer for years with an awful lot of upside for future applications this is especially true if you re working in visual production for the photoshop potential alone but that s only one of many potential use cases however ios remains the anchor on how this all actually works if your workflow can be constrained to work within ios s limitations especially for file portability it could be a solid choice however apple is also in competition with itself because the practical reality here is that the existing and considerably cheaper apple ipad 2018 is going to be enough for most people s regular usage for my own writing for example while i ve enjoyed using the ipad pro 12.9 inch s screen size and battery life there s little doubt i could have done the same on the regular model if your tablet usage is mostly in reading content watching video or a little light social networking or email it s more than enough and the ipad pro would be a very expensive indulgence the ipad pro this year is indeed a revolutionary computer but like so
