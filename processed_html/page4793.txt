Veeam Cloud Connect Storage providers : msp I &# x27;m looking for VCC storage providers and there are so many out there and not sure which one to go with. I &# x27;m hoping people could chime in and suggest the storage provider you recommend for VCC. This will be for my small clients that currently use VBR onsite and I just need an offsite copy of their backup using VCC. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks! Store it yourself, and charge for offsite backups its what we do. Thats the plan down the line. I dont have the infrastructure or capital to host the data myself at the moment. What software licensing from Veeam do you need on the host side? I would setup your own in Azure or Colo. It would be FAR more affordable than any of the VCC providers. Also, Azure has templates and such built in the marketplace already. I disagree.  We have our own VCC and are competitive on price. Thanks. I &# x27;ll look into it. I demo &# x27;d SingleHop for this and it worked as expected, no complaints, it was just more cost effective to do it myself (like other people are saying). www.storagethere.com  here, we operate out of Boise, ID. We are not a big name. We will support you fully along the way. We offer a self-service website, VCC for Backup, and will have replication and CDP implemented shortly! We also offer secure, Veeam-optimized SMB3 shares over the WAN. We have some clients using offsitedatasync.com and they seem OK. Without naming our Veeam partner we get 500GB for $25 a month.  We do have to buy the local Veeam license on rental but the $25 is per VM and gives us support and seed drives.  Very happy with the solution but we might bring it in house We set this up for our customers and now in the process of offering it publicly for others. Send me a DM for more details. I’m afraid that most of the answers you will get are either from people using the ‘big players’ or self promotions. No idea who the ‘big players’ are in your region. (You didn’t list a location.) Sorry. Im in Arizona. I work with the  Veeam Cloud Connect  offering at  ServerCentral . They &# x27;re my main provider for co-location and I run most of my MSP and hosting operations out of their facilities. Knowing the infrastructure and options available (for recovery/temporary cloud resources, etc.) makes it a good choice for my VCC deployments. If you &# x27;re in the US, the Veeam targets are San Jose, Chicago and Ashburn. PM if you need pricing info. Depending on what the client &# x27;s needs are we either host in our private cloud, with AWS or MS/Azure. Being partners with AWS and MS we get decent discounts on various flavors of storage. Plus as a Platinum partner with Veeam, our costs on licensing is so decent that we can compete with AWS/Azure (depending on the overall need/use of the backup - - is it cold tertiary storage, is is primary backup storage that that may need to spin up IRs out of etc.). I would highly suggest looking at these options (make the investment if possible) over going with a 3rd party provider.  Your costs will be lower, your ROI and Margin higher and you can pass those savings to your client(s) Take a look at Quest Technologies in Rosevile Ca, Great price point and many years in the Managed Storage Arena. Company has been around for over 34 years. Seriously, stop it. I’ve worked through incidents that involved complete Domain Compromise (Emotet  &  Trickbot). Literally every system on the Network Infected because a Domain Admin logged into an infected system. This malware can propagate throughout the network after stealing credentials of the logged in user. This means if you log on locally or RDP to a compromised system, it propagates to the Domain Controller and then every other system. Reuse passwords for the Built-In Local Administrator account? Yeah, you should stop doing that too. Trickbot can also propagate using the password hash/password of the local administrator account as well. You should deploy Logon Restrictions via GPO or deploy Microsoft’s free Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) tool to ensure that each system has a random and unique Local Administrator Password.

Come and control our lights in the office! :)  https://christmas.considerit.co.uk/ We are starting to see attackers going after the OAuth settings in Office365 which of course bypasses 2FA/SSO and normal account lockdowns. See:  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-attack-hijacks-office-365-accounts-using-oauth-apps/  for some background on the attack. Effectively if the user grants the app permission then it will effectively render itself nearly invisible under an application called something like Settings or something relatively generic. Your normal account compromise procedures likely won &# x27;t cover this at all. Worse yet you don &# x27;t have access to the general OAuth panel without a Microsoft 365 subscription (not O365) Some steps you can take to help prevent this attack vector. If you haven &# x27;t already make sure to disable users ability to install applications without admin approval or admin push. This really should be mandatory anyways, but since it isn &# x27;t the default policy many MSP &# x27;s may not have done so. Audit your Oath applications on the domain you didn &# x27;t have the first step locked down via:  https://aad.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/AppAppsPreview  this is as close as you can get to the M365 Microsoft Cloud App Security portal. and revoke anything that shouldn &# x27;t be there End user training - keep it up and warn users of this particular sign in type screen since it will be a bit different than prior phishing attacks. I &# x27;m a bit more concerned about malicious actors taking control over legitimate company applications in the longer term via hacking or bankruptcy where Admin &# x27;s have approved the application for usage but control on the back end changes to a new unknown 3rd party without any control in the process. Keep granted permissions as tight as possible but it &# x27;s hard to avoid certain permissions such as mailbox access for most legit apps. Hi guys! I &# x27;ve just posted a new blog which is my end of year review/recap. In the recap you &# x27;ll find some of my favorite blogs and subjects and the plans for future blogs. I won &# x27;t be posting blogs for a couple of weeks now and will start again in the new year. The review blog can be found here:   https://www.cyberdrain.com/monitoring-and-documenting-with-powershell-end-of-year-review/  - I hope you all have enjoyed the blogs this year, and if you have any thoughts on stuff to blog about next year, Let me know! I &# x27;m wishing you all a super happy holiday, a merry christmas, and a happy new year. Today Hacware has launched a free developer tool to ban hacked passwords.  This security tool is for JQuery Web Developers to stop allowing their end-users to create accounts with the most commonly hacked passwords.   Here you will see a demo and instructions on how to install :  https://www.hacware.com/banHackedPasswords.html Ok, before everyone goes crazy. Lets read the article. I am pretty sure that this chaos was completely unnecessary and what happened was total ignorance of the IT department reporting to city officials incorrectly. I am pretty sure this was just a large phishing attempts via email and nothing more.  " Ransomware was found. "  No. I will go out on a limb and say it was some old encrypted files from ransomware from something else. https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/13/us/new-orleans-cyberattack-state-of-emergency/index.html What do you think? I just got off the phone with a client who wants to cancel the RMM portion of our services and only have O365.  He claims that since all their stuff is in the Cloud, that they don &# x27;t need to upgrade their Win7 PCs, have AV, or  install patches. And nothing I can say will convince him otherwise.  This is second customer in two weeks who asked me the same question.  Is there some promotional campaign going on with telling business owners that they don &# x27;t need local computer security if they use the Cloud? currently working for an MSP that offers 24/7 on-call. I am on-call between 5pm-9am during the week and weekends (1 in 4 week rotation) the amount of alerts we get is rediculous; rolling window of guarenteed to be woken up once per night every night that your on. This week I got them all in one night (7+ alerts) and got no sleep for the entire night. I feel exhausted and Ill; but the MSP does not pay sick pay otherwise I would be taking the day off. I ended up working an extra +7h in two days with the alerts and out-of-hours planned work. This MSP pays time back at 1:1 and has no financial incentives for on-call; its bundled in as part of salary. Clients are billed at 1:1 time too, no minumum charge. Up all night, rolled in late but it appears to have came from my  &# x27;TOIL &# x27; time. What do other MSPs do about this? This seems very unreasonable as a technical employee and its making me very ill. If it hasn’t happened yet, I may be the first victim. Is anyone else starting to find it overwhelming? As an MSP, everything now requires 2 factor. When you log in to eleventy billion different vendors/apps/services/mgmt interfaces every day, it starts getting pretty old. Am I missing a way to mitigate some of this? Their Email follows: It has come to our attention that some Tech Data customers have received phishing emails with links to a fraudulent website, which purported to originate from Tech Data.

Thank you for your continued partnership,Tech Data Short version.... I need to find a file transfer system for documents with sensitive info. The three I found https://www.egnyte.com/ https://www.citrix.com/lp/sharefile/ https://www.proofpoint.com/us/resources/data-sheets/secure-share Does anyone here have any experience with any of these and could recommend? Also, are any of these MSP friendly (manage multiple accounts) and resold by any tech distributors (not that important if not) Lastly, are there any others I should look into or would one of these be the best option? FYI: This is for small businesses.   Under 30 employees. Thank you in advance for any help and input. EDIT (BASED ON A USERS POST) Do you need a cloud sharing, file server replacement?  No, I don ' t need a cloud server or cloud sharing. Or do you just need to be able to securely transmit files?  Just to be able to securely transmit files. Will this be internal use? Or do they need external users like clients or customers to have access?  Mostly for external users/clients to have access.  They want to put a link in their email signature so clients can click on it and upload sensitive documents to them instead of emailing them directly.   They also want some type of client portal/login so they can retrieve files as well.   I guess a good example would be.... This company sends a client a link to login and download files.   Then after signing can re-upload it using a link in an email to send it back.  Something like this. 57.2k Members 163 Online Jul 2, 2011 Cake Day
