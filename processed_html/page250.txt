The 25 Best Neil Young Covers | Consequence of Sound This feature originally ran in June 2012. We re reposting it today in celebration of Neil Young s new album,  Peace Trail. Neil Young and Crazy Horse  recently issued  Americana , their first album in nine years, comprised entirely of reworked classic, American folk songs. In celebration of its release,  Consequence of Sound  decided to turn the tables and put together a list of our favorite covers of Young s exhausting back catalog. There are plenty   hundreds of them   and they stretch back as far as the  60s and  70s. Because we couldn t include them all, the list has been cut to a healthy collection of 25 solid inclusions.

sure. Everyone from Smashing Pumpkins to Roxy Music, Patti Smith to Radiohead are included here, and that only speaks volumes to Young s expansive influence. So, while you re trekking through track after track, just think: This all goes back to one man. Pretty wild.

Artist:  Thom Yorke Originally On: After the Gold Rush  (1970) Though both singers are more often than not soaring above the proverbial clouds, their vocals straddling the otherwise thick lines between anthemic and whiny, rarely are the two compared. For most, it takes hearing  Thom Yorke ’s reverential cover of Young s  After the Goldrush , live from the 2002 Bridge School Benefit, to really elucidate the similarities. Bringing in just enough Yorkian melodrama to split the difference, the  Radiohead  frontman nervously plays a personal hero s song on the instrument it was written on, with its writer watching from the sidelines.  -Drew Litowitz __________________________________________________________ Artist:  Phish Originally On:   Tonight s the Night  (1975) Most  Phish  songs, even their slower ballads, exude positivity. All the more reason Young’s haunting ballad is a rare moment of sparse desolation in the otherwise exuberant Phish live experience. In hindsight, “Albuquerque” seems to have been an indication of how dark things were starting to get for Phish. You get the sense that guitarist Trey Anastasio, just before a decade that would include a band breakup and a battle with drug addiction, really meant it when he sang, “I’ve been starving to be alone.”  Jake Cohen __________________________________________________________ Artist:  Wilco Originally On:   Buffalo Springfield Again  (1967) One way to nail a cover song is to imitate to perfection. “Our whole angle with learning that was to do it as exact as possible,” explained drummer Glen Kotche.  Wilco ’s spot-on take of “Broken Arrow” first debuted at the  MusiCares Tribute to Neil Young , complete with the “Mr. Soul” false start, the “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” organ riff, and the eerie jazz piano outro, honors Young’s Buffalo Springfield opus while exposing what now seems like an obvious inspiration behind the disjointed, aching world of  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot .  Jon Bernstein __________________________________________________________ Doleful Lions 260 subscribers Subscribe Slint- Cortez The Killer Info Shopping Tap to unmute If playback doesn ' t begin shortly, try restarting your device.

Artist:  Slint Originally On:   Zuma  (1975) Many have taken a stab at the epic scope of  Cortez the Killer , but few have the dark muscle of post-rock godfathers  Slint . Captured in a Chicago set in 1989, vocalist Brian McMahan s unaffected, cracking voice carries the intensity, and Dave Pajo s churning guitar licks burn the edges. The smoky intensity of the then soon-to-come  Spiderland  is on fine display here, and the whole thing culminates in a fittingly feedbacky fade.  Adam Kivel __________________________________________________________ Artist:  Smashing Pumpkins Originally On:   Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere  (1969) Back in the late  80s, just as they were kicking up dust in The Windy City, the  Smashing Pumpkins  gave Neil Young s thunderous classic a shot during a session at Chicago s Reel Time Studios. Sans the denim jacket, Billy Corgan channels Young s raspy twang and spins out an anthemic solo towards the end, the likes of which would be all over Crazy Horse s sets around the same time   after all, they held the original trademarks in distortion.  Michael Roffman __________________________________________________________ Okumuracchi 21 subscribers Subscribe Don ' t Cry No Tears (Live) by Matthew Sweet Info Shopping Tap to unmute More videos Your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available.

Artist:  Matthew Sweet Originally On:   Zuma  (1975) Power-pop luminary  Matthew Sweet  doesn’t veer far from the source material on his live rendition of  Zuma ’s lead track. The original is a mid-tempo country rocker with a pop-song underbelly; Sweet interprets it as such, adding a hint of distortion. His sound owes a great deal to Neil Young, and he faithfully pays homage to his predecessor with this cover.

Artist:  Low  &  Dirty Three Originally On:   Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere  (1969) The delicate slow-core of  Low  coupled with the melancholy of the Dirty Three turn Young s Southern Gothic tale of murder into an even darker, more haunting number. Opening under staggered brushing on a snare, atmospheric guitar work ebbs and flows giving breathing room for Warren Ellis  violin. The song is virtually unrecognizable for the first six minutes, gaining in volume, teasing a collapse, until Low vocalist Mimi Parker enters with “Be on my side, and I ll be on your side.” Next to Buddy Miles  funk version, this is perhaps the most unique rendition of Young s song.  Len Comaratta __________________________________________________________ pjvideoguy 14K subscribers Subscribe Pearl Jam - F*ckin '  Up (Seattle, 1998) Info Shopping Tap to unmute If playback doesn ' t begin shortly, try restarting your device.

Artist:  Pearl Jam Originally On:   Ragged Glory  (1990) There aren’t many artists who can say they’ve earned the right to call Young “Uncle Neil”, but  Pearl Jam  definitely have. Their reverential appreciation for his grunge-shaping material is most evident when they close a lengthy set with a song like “F*!#in’ Up”, famously captured on 1998’s  Live on Two Legs .

Artist:  James Mercer (of The Shins) Originally On:   Harvest  (1972) The great thing about this cover is the personal way  James Mercer  delivers the lines. It s almost like he wrote them himself, which adds an edge to the song that s somewhat lacking in Young s more understated original. The classic harmonica break also underlines the song s wistful precision.  Tony Hardy __________________________________________________________ An error occurred.

Artist:  Del Barber Originally On:   Harvest Moon  (1992) Del Barber sings about a diner waitress on his most recent album,  Headwaters . Perhaps he’s singing about an unlucky “Unknown Legend”, a less fortunate woman still waiting to get swept away, still waiting to get out of town on the back of someone’s Harley.  Here, Barber tackles another song off  Harvest Moon , the widely covered, entrancing title track. His Canadian country twang is the perfect fit for “Harvest Moon”, and Barber injects the plaintive song with a fresh sense of urgency while staying faithful to the original.  Jon Bernstein __________________________________________________________ DaptoneRecords 73K subscribers Subscribe Charles Bradley (feat.

Artist:  Charles Bradley Originally On:   Harvest  (1972) Charles Bradley’s version of “Heart of Gold”, marked with his highly personal brand of 1970s funky soul, carries more conscious weightiness than Young’s reflective version. No surprise, considering how his debut LP,  No Time for Dreaming , sounds like it could be right out of the post-Civil Rights era. With the funky, staccato horns of the Menahan Street Band and the wondrous analog sound of Daptone production, Bradley turns it into something all his own, funky and fun but somehow very serious.  Jake Cohen __________________________________________________________ NativeAmerican4Life 5.6K subscribers Subscribe Buffy Sainte Marie -  " Helpless " Info Shopping Tap to unmute If playback doesn ' t begin shortly, try restarting your device.

Artist:  Buffy Sainte-Marie Originally On:   DéjÃ  Vu   (1970) The brilliance of this 1971 version lies in Sainte-Marie’s soulful delivery and in the background vocals. Whereas the original features soaring, drawn-out vocals, Sainte-Marie’s backup singers belt out the word “helpless” with a quick desperation that calls listeners to stand up in solidarity instead of sitting down in concession.  -Matthew Kauffman-Smith __________________________________________________________ AlbertoRossini 19K subscribers Subscribe CHROMATICS  " INTO THE BLACK "  (Official Video) Info Shopping Tap to unmute If playback doesn ' t begin shortly, try restarting your device.

Artist:  Chromatics Originally On:   Rust Never Sleeps  (1979) Neil Young s original feels somber;  Chromatics ’ take just haunts you. That stark guitar line, Ruth Radelet s glassy vocals, and Johnny Jewels  religious synths add a few signature notes on what might be Young s most fragile track to date   which, let s be honest, is saying quite a lot. Also, thanks to its vintage, analog instrumentation, the whole thing has this late  70s sheen to it, keeping it even closer to the original.  Michael Roffman __________________________________________________________ An error occurred. Try watching this video on www.youtube.com , or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser. Artist:  Patti Smith Originally On:   Prairie Wind  (2005) Patti Smith  must have brought the Carnegie Hall Tribute to Neil Young to a grinding halt. “It’s a Dream” is the centerpiece of  Prairie Wind , Neil Young’s cozy, reflective, loving album quietly released, with no proper tour to follow, after a surviving a near-lethal aneurysm in 2005. Only a singer like Smith would have the audacity to cover a song like “It’s a Dream”, which is part biography, part love-letter, and part reverie. She gently sways through the song with the heavy sincerity it demands, leaving few dry eyes along the way. Jon Bernstein __________________________________________________________ Artist:  Roxy Music Originally On:   American Stars N  Bars  (1977) In 1983,  Roxy Music  reworked “Like a Hurricane” for their live set, which wound up on their live EP  The High Road . It carries all the sexed-up swagger that Bryan Ferry typically brings, and thanks to support from a wall of expert musicians, there s this highly danceable groove in lieu of Young’s fist-pumping drive. Both draw different reactions, yet both are classic and epic in their own way.  Ryan Staskel __________________________________________________________ Artist:  Nils Lofgren Originally On:   Long May You Run  (1976) Though known nowadays as a member of the E Street Band,  Nils Lofgren  got his big break when he sang and played piano on Young’s  After the Gold Rush  album. Taken in that context, Lofgren’s covers album  The Loner: Nils Sings Neil  comes across as a heartfelt tribute. Nowhere is that more evident than on “Long May You Run”, where Lofgren, with only his voice and acoustic guitar, gives a beautifully sparse homage to Young’s longstanding legacy.  Matthew Kauffman-Smith __________________________________________________________ An error occurred.

Artist:  Nicolette Larson Originally On:   Comes a Time  (1978)   While Nicolette Larson contributed backing vocals to several of the acoustic-flavored songs on  Comes a Time , her hopeful voice remained absent from  Lotta Love  strange, considering she went on to release her own solo version of the song a mere month later (with Young s blessing, of course). What was once melancholy becomes optimistic as the tune transforms into a disco smash driven by funk bass, decadent saxophone, and an extended flute solo. Young was no stranger to genre-bending and reportedly appreciated the cover, which became even more bittersweet when Larson tragically died of liver failure in 1997.  Dan Caffrey __________________________________________________________ Artist:  Bob Dylan Originally On:   Harvest  (1972) Neil Young wrote “Old Man” when he was 27. Forty years later, hearing  Bob Dylan  run through his ragged, reverential take on Young’s song is a strange thrill. Dylan debuted this one-off performance during a run of shows at Madison Square Garden. He transforms the song, changing the line “doesn’t mean that much to me, to mean that much to you” into a question, a challenge, perhaps to himself, perhaps to Young, his contemporary, friend, and rival: “Doesn’t mean that much to me. Does it mean that much to you?”  Jon Bernstein __________________________________________________________ Artist:  Radiohead Originally On:   On the Beach  (1974) Of all the talented artists on this list who ve put their own spin on Mr. Young’s canon of work,  Thom Yorke  may be the one most perfectly suited to honor the folksy, more downbeat Neil Young of the mid-’70s. With minimal accompaniment (even compared to the original), Yorke absolutely nails “On the Beach”, which can be found on the  Radiohead  bootleg  Gagging Order: Acoustic Recordings . Give it a quality listen, and your world will turn, too.  Gilles LeBlanc __________________________________________________________ An error occurred.

Artist:  Bradford Cox (of Atlas Sound) Originally On:   After the Gold Rush  (1970) This cover dates back to summer of 2007, when Atlas Sound s  Bradford Cox  woke up one morning and couldn t shake the song out of his head. As he says,  To me, the song captures the solitude you feel when you re a kid and how it can be comforting   then you get older and solitude loses its magic.  Cox enlightens the song s country sensibilities by adding ghostly bathwater harmonies, rusty acoustics, and vocals that echo the creepiest melodies of Donovan. Oddly enough, it s actually really peaceful.  Michael Roffman __________________________________________________________ An error occurred.

Artist:  Cowboy Junkies Originally On:   Rust Never Sleeps  (1979) The Canadian country rockers covered this on their 1990 album,  The Caution Horses . It s hard to outdo Neil Young for axemanship so the  Cowboy Junkies  opted instead for a more contemplative treatment. The mandolin and accordion, along with Margot Timmins  hangdog delivery, bring an air of sad reflection to a memorable tune.  Tony Hardy __________________________________________________________ An error occurred.

Artist:  Drive-By Truckers Originally On:   Freedom  (1989) Much like Springsteen’s “Born in the USA”, Young’s stadium rocker “Rockin’ in the Free World” is darker than its chorus implies. There s perhaps no better band to shed light on this ominous cautionary tale of capitalism than the  Drive-By Truckers , who have made a living out of creating gloomy material that also happens to rock. Complete with Muscle Shoals-influenced horns and their usual multi-guitar assault, the Truckers take a Canadian anthem and turn it into a Southern one.  Matthew Kauffman-Smith __________________________________________________________ An error occurred.

Artist:  Norah Jones Originally On:   After the Gold Rush  (1970) Here s another cut from  MusiCares Tribute to Neil Young , a treasure trove of truly affectionate covers in itself. Here,  Norah Jones  plays a straight bat on this version, remaining faithful to the original. The beauty is in the way her languid, velveteen tones wrap themselves tenderly around Young s words and the subtle change of pace that emphasizes the message in the chorus.  Tony Hardy __________________________________________________________ An error occurred.

Artist:  The Bottle Rockets w/Jeff Tweedy Originally On:   On the Beach  (1974) “I remember the good old days,” sings Brian Henneman after taking the mic from  Jeff Tweedy  in this loose, on-point performance of “Walk On”, the upbeat exception that begins  On the Beach . Maybe it’s because “Walk On” sounds like an  A.M. -era  Wilco  song or that he’s playing with fellow 90’s Mid-Western Alt Country contemporaries  The Bottle Rockets , but Tweedy is at his loosest here, singing the tell-off with the enthusiasm of a young kid getting to play one of his hero’s great songs.  Jon Bernstein __________________________________________________________ An error occurred.

Artist:  Pixies Originally On:   Decade  (1977) This wildly inventive cover dates back to October of 1990, when it first surfaced as a B-side to  Bossanova  single  Dig for Me . Black Francis  snarl circles back to Young s signature timbre, and while the original has plenty of grime on it, there s a thick sludge of fuzz here, courtesy of Joey Santiago, that makes it sound more like a  Pixies  original. Isn t that the sign of a true cover?  Michael Roffman
