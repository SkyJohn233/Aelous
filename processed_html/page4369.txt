He said the whole group is really close and supportive of one another and he’s finding the Business course really interesting and relevant to what he wants to do with his life! That means so much to me, thanks Key Employment.” If I have trouble with the work given I know my teacher at Key will sit down with me and talk me through the work. Key Training has given me the retail skills which will lead to me getting a job. Since I have been out of school and became a student at Key Training I have become a happier person and no longer have to put up with bullying.
