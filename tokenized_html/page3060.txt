at amazon and other ventures from workers as well as the media and even in some cases from both last year a reporter for the washington post wrote an op-ed for the huffington post about how fair pay for amazon workers not high-profile philanthropy should be the primary goodwill strategy for bezos who bought the post in 2013 washpo staff reporter fredrick kunkle explained last september amazon s history of dodging taxes its mistreatment of workers and its ruthlessness toward even the smallest competitors have been well documented it put ambulances outside distribution centers rather than install adequate air conditioning it broke up a union organizing effort by closing the call center and dismissing everyone who worked there the new york times documented its punishing work environment in a front-page exposé the company s actions as forbes put it hark back to an earlier time when workers were treated as 'replaceable cogs in the machine see also spectrum strike enters second year with nyc protest and no end in sight within days the post had disciplined kunkle which his union argued may have been illegal given the fact that the winds of public opinion if not our laws have been blowing distinctly union-ward of late however the amazon ceo would likely do well to start rethinking his business and employment models from the ground floor up as kunkle reflected bezos should remember that his vast wealth came in part from labor and he should do more to share that wealth with workers as the owner of an institution that s critical to democracy he should go out of his way to set a tone of progressive stewardship toward employees in all his businesses instead bezos has shown that he views his employees as parts in a high-tech machine that income inequality is someone else s problem and that modern corporations owe little more to their employees than a paycheck a protest attendee takes a selfie with a demonstrator wearing a jeff bezos mask during protests against bezos
