sidelines players parents take on expenses travel for love of game toledo blade lake senior kyle brown breaks about three hockey sticks each season and each time his parents surely cringe when brown shatters his composite stick his parents have to shell out another 150 to replace it yet that is merely an ice chip in the bucket for parents of high school hockey players who often pay nearly 2,000 each season just to give their kids an opportunity to play these unique and devoted parents cough up an enormous amount of money to cover the cost of equipment ice fees and travel expenses along with a multitude of other items but they also deal with chaotic schedules due to the precious value of ice time some players practice before the break of dawn and then go to class others travel up to an hour to practice at midnight on school nights it s not like basketball where all you have to buy is a pair of shoes brown said my parents have been very supportive they buy me everything i need brown said practice and game times can get brutal he said in the past lake players would wake up at 4:30 in the morning to get ready for practice and then have to go to school sometimes you have to take a nap after school he said it takes a huge commitment mike alcala whose son mike is a sophomore on st. francis de sales varsity said he spends about 800 to 900 to pay for equipment it depends on how many sticks he goes through said alcala whose son has been playing since he was 5 alcala pays 1,050 on top of that to allow his son to play each season ice time at tam o shanter which serves as the main rink for local high school players ranges between 150 to 180 per hour ice time at the sports arena is about 195 per hour it costs an average of 120 for an hour-long session at the bowling green state university ice arena the st. francis junior varsity team whose members pay 825 to participate practices before school at 7 a.m. three days a week marciniak said at one tournament st. francis had to play one game at 6:15 in the morning and another at 10 at night the knights latest game was played at 11 p.m. matt reichardt who just finished his senior season at maumee said his parents paid 1,200 for him to play the fees cover ice time bus service and referee salaries among other things reichardt said the school covers jerseys helmets and other small equipment if a parent were to walk into a pro shop and order every piece of equipment their child would need to be a goaltender they would leave with their wallet about 3,000 lighter shin guards alone carry about a 1,000 price tag due to the costly material and expense to make them parents commonly have to replace 150 sticks skates also need to be replaced and they can cost as much as 500 wooden sticks which fewer and fewer players are using these days are about 25 apiece phillip unger s son john a st. john s junior has been a goaltender since the seventh grade unger said he has upgraded equipment almost every year since then let s just say there was some sticker shock unger said of the first time he looked into purchasing the equipment we had to buy everything the priciest pieces of equipment are the leg pads which are made of kevlar bullet proof vests are made of the same material the ungers also pay a 1,250 playing fee but other expenses put the total over 2,000 lake coach kurt steinhurst had just nine players on his team by the end of this season and he said the expense deterred some parents from letting their kids play it s so expensive steinhurst said it costs over 900 to play here it scares a lot of parents away most kids at lake have never played hockey before and some parents are used to paying 50 bucks so their kids can play a sport the flyers travel 28 miles to practice in fremont because the recreation center there charges 125 per hour for ice time the 900 charge covers bus transportation game and practice ice fees coaches salaries and the league entry fee steinhurst said the program s booster club covers the remaining expenses which come to about 13,000 phillip henzler whose son phil is a sophomore forward at st. francis said most of the high school parents already have absorbed the sticker shock through travel hockey rich bame is one of the lucky parents of a bowling green player he has to pay only 650 per season for his son cody to play the relatively low charge is due to a well-established booster organization in bowling green called the blue liners who help cover travel expenses and also provide uniforms bame said the high school season is a bargain compared to the cost of travel hockey he said the prep season is shorter and that he pays about 2,000 for his son to play club hockey henzler estimated that he spends about 10,000 a year for his son who plays year-round his son participates in travel hockey before and after the prep season the money covers hotels gas food and other expenses he loves it and we love it too henzler said contact mark monroe at
