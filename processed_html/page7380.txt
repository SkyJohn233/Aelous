Teen Summer Camp-Community Service-Pay It Shoreward|SeaTrek BVI Pay it Shoreward is SeaTrek s on-going effort to give back to the educational, research, and island communities with which we interact and collaborate. Guided by professional marine biologists and local experts, SeaTrek students participate in a variety of engaging service learning and research projects that center around the exploration of the unique tropical environments that make up the Virgin Islands. These project options afford participants a variety of authentic, hands-on learning experiences designed to enhance both their content knowledge and skill sets related to experiential marine science education and conservation. Directly and indirectly, the time and effort that SeaTrek students put forth in these projects aids numerous local, regional and international organizations in fulfilling several objectives, including the conservation of marine ecosystems for their recreational, commercial, and intrinsic value.

SeaTrek’s Pay it Shoreward in the Islands donations range from pantry food items and fleece blankets to brand new dive gear and full program scholarships. We try to give back to the people of the islands as much as we can. They open their homeland for us to explore and learn, and we want to give our students the opportunity to reciprocate in kind, should they wish to participate. We believe a little effort on our part is the least we can do and that s why all SeaTrek programs offer the optional opportunity for our students to commit a small portion of time and effort to the SeaTrek Pay it Shoreward program. To find out more about our Pay it Shoreward Scholarships  &  Donations, or how you can make a contribution, please contact  Capt. Monk and refer to the information below. SeaTrek’s Pay it Shoreward Back at Home donations range from branded dry bags and other SeaTrek gear to partial and full program scholarships. We try to give back to the people in our local communities as much as we can, especially those land-locked students who never imagined that they could do something like SeaTrek. We have a Scholarship Fund that SeaTrek families regularly contribute to so that we can help kids in need pursue their dreams and passion for the ocean. To find out more about our Pay it Shoreward Scholarships  &  Donations, or how you can make a contribution, please contact  Capt.

In 2018, we created a not-for-profit branch of SeaTrek called Sea Giving: Give and Sea Change! We have obtained our 501(c) 3 status so that your contributions can be tax-deductible. We are hopeful that Sea Giving will afford us the opportunity to grow our fundraising, scholarship, research, education and outreach efforts, both at home in the U.S. and throughout the Caribbean. To find out more about Sea Giving or how you can contribute, please contact  Capt. Monk . We welcome your support – time, expertise, or financial.
