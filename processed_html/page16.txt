what is the value of i^53? | Yahoo Answers you know that i^4 = 1 i^53 = i^(52+1) = i^52 * i^1 = 1 * i = i  (52/4=13, which means after 13 iterations, i^(4*13) = (i^4)^13 = 1^13 = 1) i^53 = i^52 * i = (i^4)^13 * i = (1)^13 * i = i i = -1 if you multiply that by itself 53 times your going to get a negative one which is just the same thing. answer= -1 which is i
