dream out of reach is key west too expensive fun in key west fun in key west your key west experts tours charters lodging travel there have been several articles recently about the high cost of living in key west as well as the low wages this seems to be the trend everywhere as part of the journey housing is the first thing we need to secure in our move to key west do you rent or do you own i think i would prefer to own it appears to be much cheaper than rent looking at rent in key west it is very expensive here is an article on moving to key west and the costs it appears to be just simply a case of supply and demand few housing options and high demand we see this a lot when we travel to other vacation destinations those who live and work in the resort town usually can not afford to live there key west is in a unique position since it is an island there really is not a lot of options other than going farther up the keys but then you are forced into a longer than needed wanted commute which just adds more expenses to someone s budget let s examine how much housing costs versus how much it should cost a small tiny place in key west starts around 1,600 a month this is most likely a studio or very small bedroom apartment reminiscent of the high cost of housing in manhattan since key west has such a strong tourist draw the majority of employers are in the hospitality trade i have a kid who has a culinary degree so i truly understand how underpaid most of these employees are so let s assume you can find a job paying 10 an hour and let s further assume you are able to work full time keep in mind most hospitality jobs are part-time then your monthly gross wages are 1,600 a month well without a roommate or several a one bedroom apartment is totally out of reach so to back into the amount of money you need to make assume no more than 25 of your take-home pay should go to housing then your monthly net income should be 6,500 wow how many servers bartenders front desk clerks make that much looks like everyone needs at least two jobs that s why we are looking at owning keep in mind it usually is always cheaper to own than rent looking at a small two bedroom condo including your condo fees our house payment is in the 1,200 range this gives us a bigger place with a lower monthly payment this amount keeps us somewhat in line with our current mortgage but obviously a house half the size but after all there are sacrifices to make when living in paradise exploring all of the housing options in key west got me thinking about the high cost of housing not just in key west but everywhere even in small to mid-size towns across america unaffordable housing is an issue going back to my example of 10 an hour then you gross 1,600 month which makes your take home around 1,360 after taxes let s then walk through a typical budget if an apartment costs 600 about average in most areas this is a per bedroom cost and if you have a car payment and car insurance of 400 then there is only 360 dollars left in the budget and you haven t eaten yet or paid your student loan payments or put gas in your car or bought well anything so i guess part of the issue is minimum wage isn t enough to live on yet we pay most of hospitality workers minimum wage we by default have created a system where these folks can never afford to live a decent life or even get ahead not the american dream we are promised is it i know i know the answer is education go to school get good grades and then get a good job well i have another kid graduated with a petroleum technology degree can not find a job upon graduation the oil and gas market dropped yeah no one is hiring so to pay for his student loans and other expenses he is now a long distance truck driver he has a job but not in his field but better pay than being a waiter i don t know what the answer is but i am fully aware there is a problem how can we fix it i don t know but am welcome to hearing ideas i try to tip those in hospitality well especially if they provide great service i think that is a start learning a new trade skill or vocation yep there s another idea how about owning your own business taking your financial future firmly into your own hands another idea for now we are are looking at our options on buying a slice of paradise it will be small but it will be in key west but we are certainly embarking on this adventure with our eyes wide open plus we will let you know about current activities in key west and on the site all right reserved
