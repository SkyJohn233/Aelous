Panel Description: California cannabis businesses and consumers alike are operating in a space that's more heavily regulated than ever before. With billions of dollars on the table, the transition to becoming fully compliant with the ever-changing state regulations is critical, yet it's certainly not without challenges. As attention is increasingly paid to ensure that brands, dispensaries, and growers are fully compliant, how are the industry's most culturally-relevant and established players making the transition, and how are they shaping it's touchstone: cannabis culture, in the process? @bruvs @grasslandagency @highsnobiety @gallery.pr #BDSanalytics #arielclark #clarkneubert #doublebarrel #sherbinski #cannabis #cannabisindustry #thepottery #earthgrowngoods 20% OFF Entire Store ALL DAY, however, this panel discussion is RSVP only and at 7pm - 9pm. 5042 Venice Blvd. Los Angeles, LA, 90019 Email: info@thepottery.la Store Phone : (323) 452-9833 Delivery Phone : (424) 256-5388 Instagram  |  YouTube Channel Press/Media Business Hours: 9AM - 10PM Mon - Sat  & 9AM - 7PM Sundays Medicinal Cannabis (18+)  &  Adult-Use Cannabis  (21+) LICENSE #: A10-18-0000188-TEMP Copyright Â© 2019 The Pottery.
