I have always wanted to keep track of the countries/states/provinces I've traveled to and this is the perfect way for me to see what next adventure I need to head off to. I saw this at my nephew's home and he gifted it to me. It's a great gift to give to a young adult not only to understand countries and locations, but also to allow them to dream and as they begin their travels to remind them of where they've been. A truly great product!" — Pat Obuchowski Get it from Amazon for  $23.99+  (available in two sizes).

It's soft, runs true-to-size, and the lettering doesn't look cheap. I usually wear a L or XL so I ordered an XXL to be loose. It's a little in the thinner side but not in a bad way. I live in Texas so I'll be able to wear this often!" — Kkbday Get it from Amazon for  $25.95  (available in sizes S-3XL).

I use them on planes to listen to the in-flight entertainment with my AirPods. I also use them to listen to music on my laptop with my AirPods. They work really well. Now, I don't have to carry my wired earbuds with me when I travel anymore. They really work as advertised. I have not had any issues with them since I started using them." — RPL Get it from Amazon for  $44.99 .

But on breaks, when I have too much time, I sink into nothingness. I didn't expect this book to do much, especially since I thought 'mindfulness' was some BS. Even if it's the same prompts every day, it's what you make out of the book. I like mentally checking off the three small accomplishments I held myself accountable for in ink, somehow the book is better than my Post-it note to-do lists. And the main reason for the five stars, it helps with my depression." — KellBell Get it from Amazon for  $13.46 . Share On Facebook Share On Pinterest Share On Pinterest Share On Email Share On Copy Promising review:  "FABULOUS book! I bought a hardback for a gift, kept the softcover for myself. It's like a food history, travelogue, and [limited] cookbook in one. SO MUCH fun. Organized by countries/regions/ethnicities. I'm rather well-informed about (and like to eat and cook) international dishes. This has many familiar ones but many more new adventures to try!" — Aunt Lolli Get it from Amazon for  $13.99+  (available in paperback or with binding).

It's so soft and warm, he loves it, therefore I love it!" — NS3000 Get it from Amazon for  $18.99+  (available in six sizes and 18 colors).

I already knew about these rollers and their natural cooling/healing properties. It was so relaxing and amazing using this roller and gua sha. It felt like a mini spa facial, but at home! The instruction card was super easy to read and follow. Overall great product. I would definitely buy as a gift for friends. It's the cutest thing and so useful too. Everyone should have one of these in their beauty arsenal." — AmazonCustomer Get the set from Amazon for  $17.99 . Share On Facebook Share On Pinterest Share On Pinterest Share On Email Share On Copy Promising review:  "After reading a  glowing review by a frequent international flyer , I decided the twistable travel pillow was exactly what my husband needed. That traveler returned from an overseas trip and immediately purchased his second one for his lumbar region. So I bought two upfront, but not for air travel. My husband has osteoporosis with an overly curved upper back. It is uncomfortable for him to sit for long periods, even in his recliner. Well, many snores later, he decided these were the perfect solution! That evening I placed one behind my neck, just to test it out. Apparently, I had no idea how uncomfortable it actually was just sitting.  My neck never had it so good!  So I used the lumbar one as well. Felt like I was floating in the chair. Have shown them to everyone. A physical therapist friend went gaga over the concept, and plans to give them as gifts this year." — SMB Get it from Amazon for  $24.99  (available in two colors).

These are such a blast to make, I'm always a bit sad when I complete one because making them is so damn fun!" — A. Cat Get it from Amazon for  $34.95+  (available in three designs). Share On Facebook Share On Pinterest Share On Pinterest Share On Email Share On Copy Promising review:  "My fiance is incredibly happy with these. When she wears her hair down she likes to keep a ponytail holder on hand in case she wants to put her hair up, but she doesn't like the pressure and indentation left around her wrist. She uses the thicker Goody rubberbands, which fit nicely on this bracelet and look good too. She hasn't had any problems with the rubberbands slipping off, and they can be squeezed together to tighten around the wrist, but would probably be a bit too large for tiny wrists. It is a nice enough piece of jewelry that she will sometimes even wear them without needing the hair tie. Per her suggestion: Brown hair ties look good with the rose gold, but black would look better with the silver." — Rick Ideker Get it from Amazon for  $13.66+  (available in gold, silver, and rose gold).

They’re durable, easy to clean, and a great conversation piece. They’re also good for portioning out cocktails. I especially like the larger capacity of these guys. I use them all the time, for cocktails and for cooking as well!" — Mitch F. Get it from Amazon for  $19.98 .

I give these as gifts all the time as a way of introducing the benefits of matcha to my friends and family." — Soozie Get it from Amazon for  $12.99 . And if you want to be super generous throw in some  yummy matcha . Share On Facebook Share On Pinterest Share On Pinterest Share On Email Share On Copy Promising review:  "Love this cup! It's easy to clean and use. I love the fact that you can personalize the label. Very happy. My coworkers ordered some too." — Ernesto T.

These pencils are circular in design, meaning once they are so small that you can no longer use them to write, they serve a new purpose as a plant. It’s a wonderful concept!" — Erica D. Medrano Get a pack of eight from Amazon for  $14.95 . Share On Facebook Share On Pinterest Share On Pinterest Share On Email Share On Copy Promising review:  "They are one-size-fits-all so if you have smaller feet (adult women's 5-7) they may be a little big. I am around a 6.5-7 and they fit okay but on the bigger size. I still think they are wonderful gifts for runners or athletes! They are also great quality for the price!" — brelli Get it from Amazon for  $9.99 .

My husband does physical labor for work and it’s nice for him to be able to tell me what hurts, and I just look up techniques that work on that specific area. The instructions are also easy to read and follow for someone inexperienced." — Haley Get it from Amazon for  $13.46 . Share On Facebook Share On Pinterest Share On Pinterest Share On Email Share On Copy Promising review:  "This is a delightful product! The jelly ball comes encased in a balloon and comes with a pick tool to pop the balloon while still in a plastic shell, however my pick just made a hole in the balloon and I had to cut it open a bit more with some scissors, but it was still really fun to open. It has a nice light smell and it lathers well, and I really enjoyed rubbing the weird, squishy texture all over my face. You can keep the jelly ball in the plastic case it comes in, but I have a cheap makeup brush cleaner that I put mine in and it looks like a rose quartz crystal ball. I just bought it for fun but it might become a regular part of my skincare routine!" — Kindle Customer Get it from Amazon for  $11.32 .

Share On Facebook Share On Pinterest Share On Pinterest Share On Email Share On Copy Promising review:  "This wallet is so great! So much better than even much more expensive wallets that I've purchased. I'm sensitive to smells and was concerned that it might smell after reading some reviews complaining about that — it doesn't smell at all! The yellow color is amazingly bright. I am always misplacing things, but I never lose track of this wallet! The best thing about it is the envelope design, it opens up and you can see everything clearly, no flipping through tabs/panels. It has just the right amount of organizational space for me — not so little that I get messy, but not so much that I get overwhelmed and/or confused. There are three slots for credit cards. There is a pen holder which fits a sharpie fine point pen wonderfully! The ID holder is fantastic because it is easy to whip out an ID very quickly. I attached a key ring and my house key to the middle of the wallet. There's a zippered purse that's great for loose change and a slot to hold paper bills. One panel has a large pocket to hold boarding pass/receipt and a small pocket to hold business cards. The only feature I don't currently use is the SIM card slot. The wallet is big enough to hold all the above items but small enough that it fits into the outside pocket of my backpack (I'm a student). In case you can't tell, I love, love, love this wallet so much." — Bex Get it from Amazon for  $12.99+  (available in 36 colors).

Could I *BE* any happier with this shirt? Nope! :)" — Chelsea Lewis Get it from Amazon for  $9.99+  (available in sizes S-XL and in six designs). Share On Facebook Share On Pinterest Share On Pinterest Share On Email Share On Copy Promising review:  "I travel often for work, and it’s so much easier to pack a few Pocket Palettes than tote my regular makeup — they’re super carry-on bag/airport-friendly! I love my Lancôme but I’d much rather not tote around heavy glass bottles, so I keep a palette at the ready for the gym, in my purse, at my desk at work, etc. — they’re that convenient. For the makeup itself, the quality of the BB cream is great. It’s light, feels and looks natural, you can get at least two full uses out of the quantity. The lip/cheek color amount is also generous. I personally go for a darker lip generally, but this is good for blush and will last me a while. I love how handy the mascara applicator is, so fun-sized. For someone on the go, who isn't soooo makeup savvy that I'm contouring all the time, this product is really practical!" — Maureen Get a pack of three from Amazon for  $11.99  (available in four shades).

My coworkers and I were going to the local Siren at least three to four times a week for our afternoon pick me up. It was starting to become a serious drain financially. We all chipped in to get this pitcher and take turns buying beans. Get them ground for a French press, or super coarse, and you'll have a pretty good replica. The instructions for making cold brew are pretty easy. Of course, you'll get some micro grinds that will make their way through the filter but that's to be expected. If you're OCD about it, you could pour it through a strainer or paper filter. Or just let it settle and pour gently. We've seriously cut down our caffeine expenditures by 50-75%. Now if we could figure out a way to order out less. :)" — DT Get it from Amazon for  $16.99 .

Imagine my surprise when my dad opened his gift and pulled out some very high-quality items. The decanter looks beautiful with a dark liquor in it, and the glasses are perfect for happy hour. They are pretty resilient, too! I happened to knock one off a coffee table and it didn't even chip. Oh! And in case you're wondering, the stopper fits in the decanter very well. It's not loose at all." — Julesie_O Get the seven-piece set from Amazon for  $17.99 .

They do shed a bit but that's just until you break them in. They are a bit higher than your typical slipper. The criss-cross is not one solid piece, it's two pieces. I would go with your regular size for the room. I got the smaller one because of other reviews and wish I got the 7/8. But you can see in my photos that they are just fine and cute. Super soft and comfy!" — Dijana Get them from Amazon for  $23.99  (available in sizes 5-10 and in five colors). Share On Facebook Share On Pinterest Share On Pinterest Share On Email Share On Copy Promising review:  "I bought this bag for a trip I recently took and am extremely pleased with it. The versatility of being reversible (dark to light) was a plus, getting two for the price of one. It is soft and supple and holds a ton of stuff! My 13' laptop/tablet fit perfectly and there was still room for a lot of other travel stuff. The magnet that holds the flaps together was strong, too. I would definitely purchase this product again and will use it on future trips!" — D. Webb Get it from Amazon for  $25.99+  (available in seven colors).

I was afraid the spice would be overpowering, but it’s actually quite mellow and smooth; just the right touch of heat. So far, I’ve enjoyed this on fruit salad (banana/strawberry/blueberry) with cottage cheese and drizzled on the original Chick-fil-A sandwich....so delicious!" — Sleeps in Rain Get it from Amazon for  $8.48 .
