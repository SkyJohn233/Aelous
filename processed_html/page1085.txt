One way is to, of course, pay for the NNA's Loan Signing Agent Training Course, which is designed to help you pass that test. While I love many of the services the NNA provides, I think this training and corresponding test falls short on preparing new agents to do this job well, AND build a business and lifestyle around it. That's why I have started the Sign  &  Thrive Notary Training COurse and community. Tomorrow morning, as we do twice a month, we will have an online test-taking party, where we will collaboratively take the test together. Each student shares their thoughts on the correct answer, and I add my two-cents. Then, you decide! We have a 95% pass rate! Once you take the test, you are on your way to building your dream business and lifestyle. Then, on January 20, join us for a Thrive Live webinar for techniques on Local Search optimization for your website. Notaries are found on search engines. You need to be on page one! These are exclusively for Sign  &  Thrive members. Join at  http://www.SignandThrive.com  For more information, visit  http://www.notarycoach.com Loading...     Loading...     Loading...
