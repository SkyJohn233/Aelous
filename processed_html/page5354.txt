Richard Burke Jr. - Wikipedia Richard Burke  (9 February 1758 – 2 August 1794) was a  barrister  and  Member of Parliament  in  England . He was born in  Battersea , the son of  Edmund Burke  and Jane Mary Nugent. [ 1 ]  He was educated at  Westminster School  and  Christ Church, Oxford , and was called to the bar at the  Middle Temple  in 1780. His father had high hopes for "the Whelp", never to be realized. He was Recorder of Bristol from 1783 until his early death. In 1791 Richard carried out a mission to the  Koblenz  headquarters of the French émigré army on behalf of his father, who was indulging in private diplomacy. Thereafter he returned to Ireland to become an agent of the Catholic Committee, which attained a small measure towards  Catholic Emancipation  in the  Irish Parliament's  "Roman Catholic Relief Act" (1793). In 1794 his father resigned his seat in parliament for  Malton, North Yorkshire  over the  failure to convict Warren Hastings  in a parliamentary impeachment. Richard was elected in succession to his father, but fell ill soon afterwards, and died in  South Kensington  at the early age of thirty-six on 2 August 1794, and was buried in  Beaconsfield . The elder Burke suffered grief on a scale described by eyewitnesses as "truly terrific". In the words of his biographer, Edmund's bursts of affliction were of fearful force, so overwhelming indeed as to fright and almost to paralyze those who were around them. The  Dictionary of National Biography  article describes the grief of the parents as "almost uncontrollable", and his father   considered himself ‘marked by the hand of God’  [ 2 ] Richard had been a member of  The Club  since 1782. His contacts with  Samuel Johnson  were fairly slight, and on one occasion involved a rebuke to the younger man for futile attempts at "smart drollery". No evidence has been found to support the claim that he was married. He should not be confused with his uncle, also named Richard Burke.
