One hundred and ten million people around the world speak this [language], which comes from Canton, "  Lei Jianwei said at the Guangzhou Municipal People’s Congress. “Foreigners have called it that for 200 years, but now the translation of the city is the pinyin 'Guangzhou'. I suggest we upgrade this to a strategic height.” Lei said the 12th five-year plan had seven points to raise Guangzhou’s international position, including culture, international trade, talent, travel and aviation, and its official English language name was important, like it was the city’s namecard. He even suggested Guangzhou authorities design a coat of arms or logo and it be printed on Mayor Chen Jianhua’s namecard. The name Canton originally came from a Portuguese language rendering of Guangzhou.   Read more All eyes on Hu Chunhua as he takes over as Guangdong party chief Read more Guangzhou to replace local 'goon squads' with citywide force Read more Guangzhou floats plan to double urban area Read more All eyes on Hu Chunhua as he takes over as Guangdong party chief Read more Guangzhou to replace local 'goon squads' with citywide force Read more Guangzhou floats plan to double urban area
