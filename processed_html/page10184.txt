Wadi Mukheiris - Jordan Forum - TripAdvisor Does anyone have any experience of hiking in this wadi. I am worried that in the summer it will be too hot. How wet would you get to cool us down! it does get hot in the summer, and you not get that much shade in that Wadi,, the running water does turn into a small trical at places.  it could take up to 4 hours to reach the pool area ( the end of the hike ) do-able with head-gear (hats) and plenty of drinking water... more for adults, a bit xtreme for kids..... ciao A99 Dear macpolo , Wadi Mukheiris a beautiful 20 meter waterfall, as for Route one way and back,so be careful and well-prepared on hot days,you will need for Walking about 6 hours including resting time. you will need this things: - A hat to protect the head from the sun. - Strong and good shoes for walking. - water about 2 liter. you can see this link for more information: hiking-in-jordan.com/index.php/hiking-trailsâ€¦ ............................. i hope for you a nice trip John john  thanks for the link.I enjoyed the video.
