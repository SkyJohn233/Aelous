Very good too,are liking Art. wow neato Aww this was pretty amazing i wonder how long it took you to complete this one? especially with all the fine detail and all the faces and bodies you have around seems like you really put some time into this, very nice art piece here. I would suggest to improve on this in my opinion ofcourse would to add some "COLOR" on the outer edges just to make it more standout in the middle ~X~ so metal SO METAL! looks like the gates of hell or something. really like your line work on this one, very kinetic. Simetry Rocks I really liked to find it all so simetric, looks like something that has a lot of work put into it not realy, it's simetrical cuase it's all one and the same drawing, mirrored against eachother, didn't take me more then a day thanks anyway though ^^
