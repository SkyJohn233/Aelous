conservation of nature s resources advancement boy scouting provides a series of surmountable obstacles and steps in overcoming them through the advancement method the boy scout plans his advancement and progresses at his own pace as he meets each challenge the boy scout is rewarded for each achievement which helps him gain self-confidence the steps in the advancement system help a boy scout grow in self-reliance and in the ability to help others associations with adults boys learn a great deal by watching how adults conduct themselves scout leaders can be positive role models for the members of the troop in many cases a scoutmaster who is willing to listen to boys encourage them and take a sincere interest in them can make a profound difference in their lives personal growth as boy scouts plan their activities and progress toward their goals they experience personal growth the good turn concept is a major part of the personal growth method of boy scouting boys grow as they participate in community service projects and do good turns for others probably no device is as successful in developing a basis for personal growth as the daily good turn the religious emblems program also is a large part of the personal growth method frequent personal conferences with his scoutmaster help each boy scout to determine his growth toward scouting s aims leadership development the boy scout program encourages boys to learn and practice leadership skills every boy scout has the opportunity to participate in both shared and total leadership situations understanding the concepts of leadership helps a boy accept the leadership role of others and guides him toward the citizenship aim of scouting uniform the uniform makes the boy scout troop visible as a force for good and creates

national scout jamboree every four years and participates in world scout jamborees also held at four-year intervals fort a. p. hill virginia was the site of the 2001 national scout jamboree scouting as known to millions of youth and adults evolved during the early 1900s through the efforts of several men dedicated to bettering youth these pioneers of the program conceived outdoor activities that developed skills in young boys and gave them a sense of enjoyment fellowship and a code of conduct for everyday living in this country and abroad at the turn of the century it was thought that children needed certain kinds of education that the schools couldn t or didn t provide this led to the formation of a variety of youth groups many with the word scout in their names for example ernest thompson seton an american naturalist artist writer and lecturer originated a group called the woodcraft indians and in 1902 wrote a guidebook for boys in his organization called the birch bark roll meanwhile in britain robert baden-powell after returning to his country a hero following military service in africa found boys reading the manual he had written for his regiment on stalking and survival in the wild gathering ideas from seton america s daniel carter beard and other scoutcraft experts baden-powell rewrote his manual as a nonmilitary skill book which he titled scouting for boys the book rapidly gained a wide readership in england and soon became popular in the united states in 1907 when baden-powell held the first campout for scouts on brownsea island off the coast of england troops were spontaneously springing up in america william d. boyce a chicago publisher incorporated the boy scouts of america in 1910 after meeting with baden-powell boyce was inspired to meet with the british founder by an unknown scout who led him out of a dense london fog and refused to take a tip for doing a good turn immediately after its incorporation the bsa was assisted by officers of the ymca in organizing a task force to help community organizations start and maintain a high-quality scouting program those efforts climaxed in the organization of the nation s first scout camp at lake george new york directed by ernest thompson seton beard who had established another youth group the sons of daniel boone which he later merged with the bsa provided assistance also on hand for
