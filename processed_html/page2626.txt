Featured Veranda Installation Last month, our approved reseller, SS Fisher Installations installed a  Simplicity Alfresco Veranda  at a property in Chester, Cheshire. Their customer required a modern garden canopy that would protect them from all of the weather conditions the UK deals with. The Simplicity Alfresco is perfect for this as it provides cover from the rain whilst creating a cooler and shaded area underneath when it is hot and sunny too. This enables customers to use their garden all year round. To enable them to enjoy their garden whilst feeling some warmth during the winter, the customer opted to have our  Infrared Wall Mounted Heaters  added to their order. The heaters have ceramic elements that are designed to gently warm those underneath using infrared radiation which is completely harmless and contains no ultraviolet radiation. The veranda installed was 7.37m x 3m and was coloured in Grey Aluminium (RAL 9007) with a matt finish. The Simplicity Alfresco can be covered with either 8mm toughened glass or 35mm structured polycarbonate. On this occasion, the toughened glass was chosen and I think these choices work perfectly with the veranda and the customers house, creating a high end, contemporary appearance.
