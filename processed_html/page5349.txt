He was crossing the Caltrain train tracks when a passenger train came out of the bend and hit him.  "We need to console each other in these times," said Raj Jayadev from Silicon Valley De-Bug. Many were inconsolable as they mourned the loss of a talented 16-year-old.  "The train clipped him and he spun, he just wasn't paying attention. So there's a lesson. Let it be a lesson to all teenagers who think it's cute, 'Come on, let's go play on the train tracks.' The tracks are not cute," said Kianta Noble, Johnican's mother. Johnican was wearing headphones and listening to music as the train approached. He was just a few yards away from his home.  "The hardest part is I want Donae back," said Deshonn Noble, Donae's uncle, who then began to cry.  The Lincoln High School junior was loved. Hundreds filled Theodore Lenzen Park with memories, tears and wishes. "Today, if I could just hear Donae sing me a song…," said Janice Carolina, Donae's grandmother. Donae loved music. He made a music video for a channel called Silicon Valley De-Bug recently. "Music has been a big part of my life, since I was a kid," said Donae in the video.  He walked the halls of Lincoln High with his guitar in hand and a smile on his face. "I think he was the one who deserved to live more than anyone," said Jeanninne Pecot, Donae's friend. He brought joy to those around him. Now, they struggle to find meaning in their loss. "God gave me the blessing of giving birth to an angel and everybody doesn't get to do that and all of you got to love him," said Noble as she teared up and spoke to the crowd.  The medical examiner has ruled this death an accident and Caltrain had already planned to add fencing along the track. \nIt happened around 4 p.m. when Johnican was walking home from Lincoln High School.
