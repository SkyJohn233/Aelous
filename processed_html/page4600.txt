4one4 Real Estate | LinkedIn The name 4one4 came from the business location at 414 Main Road Glenorchy. 4one4 Real Estate opened for business in March 2006 and was created by like minded people with one goal in mind, which was to provide a unique agency that would exceed our clientâ€™s expectations in every way.4one4 Real Estate soon gathered an enthusiastic team of consultants with AQ Berry lending his years of real estate experience to become a mentor to the business. Paul and Robyn Berry welcomed their son Patrick into the family business, who looks destined to make real estate his career for life as his father did, and his father before him.The success of 4one4 Real Estate encouraged Paul to open a second branch in 2007 located in Brighton. With the help of well known real estate agent Damien Hollingsworth, the office has proven to be another success story, with Brighton now one of the fastest growing areas north of Hobart. 4one4 Real Estate is now a household name in the northern suburbs and Brighton communities. The organisation is known for offering creative marketing ideas matched with strong family values. This has proven to be a point of difference, other large corporate real estate agencies find difficult to match. In just five years, 4one4 Real Estate has grown from three staff at one location, to 14 staff in two locations, and is still continuing to grow. 414 Main Road Glenorchy, Tasmania 7010, AU Excited to announce we are expanding our digital marketing options for all 4one4 clients! #digitalmarketing #realestate
