Getting state update from zwave RFID reader - Z-Wave - Home Assistant Community Got myself a Zipato RFID reader (same as Schlage/Benext) to be used by my cleaning lady. All my normal home/away/alarm functionality is driven by automations and mainly based on presence detection of phones  &  movement. So the panel only needs to be used by people not part of the normal household but own a RFID tag from me. Problem: As such OZW supports this device but my issue is that this device (for some reason) does not seem to support setting it’s state by the controller. This means it can arm/disarm my alarm based on the tags but I cannot set the panel to arm/disarm by the controller. This means there is a big risk the panel and my alarm modes get out of sync. And then the cleaning lady comes again after a few days, house mode is Away and alarm is also in away mode. She enters but a using her correct RFID tag will have no effect as the Panel is still in disarm mode (so no state change). With alarm still in away, alarm will sound… Some ideas but no idea how to do: So I would like to see when a correct RFID tag is used even if the panel is already in disarm mode. As you can see in below log dump, the device reports correctly that it is disarmed (again) by sending again  Access Control event:6, status=255  . Unfortunately I don’t know how to catch this ‘updated change’ (even tough the status is identical vs previous state). Does not even report a lastupdate The issue is that this does not generate a state change in hass, also no change in the lastupdated ( states.sensor.schlage_link_mini_keypad_rfid_access_control_29_9.last_updated ). Question: Does anyone know how I can catch this in HASS? If it helps, I have been working with the Zipato too.
