divine help sam gasped as he brought back by lucifer he tried to kill himself again and failed he growled to himself and got up he was dizzy from blood loss so he took it slow he looked at the cabin he found and stationed himself at away from dean and castiel he sighed sadly with tears in his eyes which he refused to let fall he let the devil himself out of his cage and dean wanted nothing more to do with him a day after the incident dean dropped him like a hot rock he chose castiel over him as well not only had he been disowned he also been replaced in one night he did n't really remember what dean said thanks to him bashing his own head in but the one thing he did remember dean saying to him was something he wanted to forget you let the damn devil himself out of cage this is the final straw sam as of now we 're not brothers as far as i know my real little brother died a long time ago get out sam you 're not welcome here anymore castiel and i will clean up the mess you made dean snarled dean- sam whispered getting shoved out the door with his things i said get out i never want to see you again dean shouted i 'm sorry i love you sam tried i hate you dean spat and slammed the motel door behind him that was a few weeks ago sam shook his head the argument was much worse but that 's part he remembered well but so desperately wanted to forget he scrubbed his face now was not the time to cry after he left dean lucifer appeared to him in his dreams and told him that he was his vessel which sam refused to be he figured if he died lucifer would n't stand a chance plus dean would n't have never have to see him again but he keeps bringing me back dammit sam snarled maybe that 's a good thing kiddo a voice said sam whipped around and saw gabriel the archangel why was he here what are you doing here sam asked i 'm here to help sam a lam you could use some divine help gabriel said help me the monster that let the damn devil walk sam asked kid it was n't your fault not entirely gabriel said firmly but softly sam sighed it is my fault now if you 'll excuse me gabriel i have some dying to do sam-wait did you call me gabriel he asked i figured it out a while ago sam said grabbing the salt what 's that for gabe asked worriedly if i ca n't die any other way then maybe salt and fire will do the trick sam said devoid of emotion sam no i ca n't let you do this gabriel pleaded i 'm sorry sam whispered placing a bloody palm on the symbol he drew when he got here just in case if castiel showed up for whatever reason with tears running down his face he re doused the cabin with gasoline and then himself he then salted the cabin and himself with a whispered prayer for castiel and heaven to look after dean for him he lit his zippo and dropped it gabriel was blasted back and landed outside he watched in horror as the cabin burned but there was nothing he could do when an angel got blasted it prevented them for going back to that particular place no gabriel whispered he closed his eyes he had been too late gabriel cared for sam and now he was too late to save him and the world was going to suffer he snarled when he got his hands on lucifer he was going to kick his ass looking for someone a voice asked wha-mikey gabriel exclaimed it 's michael and yes we need to leave we have to get sam to safety michael said he was cradling an unconscious sam gabriel nodded and snapped his fingers when sam woke up they were going to have a very long talk there you guys and gals go the first chapter to the newbies this is an au my regulars already know that
