Magnetic Dragon egg Print  Collection Icon used to indicate a Magnetic Dragon egg in the game DragonVale. DragonVale is a  simulation  video game  created  by  Backflip  Studios for the iOS platform. It can be  downloaded  for free from the  Apple  App  Store  and  played  on the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad. It is also  available  via  Google  Play and the  Amazon  App  Store  for play on  Android  devices. It was  released  in  September  2011 and uses the  freemium  business model.* In the game,  players  create a  theme  park  filled  with  dragon  habitats,  attracting  virtual  visitors  and  connecting  with  other  players.  Leveling  up is  achieved  by breeding,  raising  and  caring  for dragons, and  decorating  your park by  adding  walkways, trees, decorations, and  various  buildings. The  number  of  visitors  is  dependent  on the type and  level  of  dragons  in the park and how well  designed  it is.* There are  hundreds  of  different  types of  dragons  that can be bred in the game, and each  species  carries  traits  from one or more  defining  categories, or “Elements” as they are known. The  Magnetic  Dragon is one of a  large  group of  dragons  that are  known  as “Regular Hybrids”;  these  species are  created  by the  breeding  of any two  dragons  that  share  the  appropriate  Elemental characteristics.  Magnetic  Dragons  share  the  traits  of both  Lightning  and  Metal  Elements, and the icon  representing  their egg  contains  the  yellow  background of  Lightning  surrounded by the  brown  hexagons of Metal.          *Information  courtesy  of http://dragonvale.wikia.com/wiki/DragonVale Graphical characteristics: Asymmetric ,  Closed shape ,  Colorful ,  Contains both straight and curved lines ,  Has no crossing lines .
