Children dancing | Dancing is such a fantastic way to spend time. Not only is it fun, but also it gives children goals and objectives to work towards. Some choose to take dance examination and medal awards, then progress to competitions and dance shows. Inspiring children to dance and helping them discover movement is a priority for all young students who work with me. They learn discipline, determination and respect to encourage growing up as successful dancers. Your child will follow a clear curriculum of dance programme so you can very easily see what they are working towards and how they are progressing. Starting from Rosettes, through Starddance Awards, Grades and all the way to International Dance Awards. After taking dance exams, your child will start preparing for competitions. They will have a chance to dance in some of the most famous Ballrooms in the World including Blackpool Winter Gardens. Competitions are danced with a teacher or equal level dance partner. With the Medal Awards and Competitions behind their belt, every child participates in dances shows. It s a great way to show them how much progress they re making by performing in front of others. This could be a social party or maybe an event you re organising.
