My Senses - KS1 Resources - Twinkl Our senses are what help us to understand and interact with the world we live in. The five senses include Sight, Sound, Smell, Touch and Taste. Each of our senses sends messages to our brain through receptor cells, using our nervous system to deliver them. Use this collection of resources to teach your KS1 students all about the five senses and which body parts they relate to. Includes display resources, PowerPoints and worksheets to help your class to engage with the topic and memorise the key vocabulary.
