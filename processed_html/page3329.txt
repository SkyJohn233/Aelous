Drinks At A Bar: First Date Ideas - AskMen It ' s a first date go-to for a reason: drinks at a bar are a super simple way to warm up and get to know someone new. For a start, there ' s alcohol around, which is a good way to reduce those first date nerves (optional, of course, and make sure not to overdo it!). There ' s also usually mood lighting and the bustling atmosphere of other people chatting to each other, so the scene is already well set. The difficulty level is low with this one: it ' s unlikely to surprise her as an option, and it ' s generally an easy way to transition from meeting (whether IRL or on an app like  Tinder ) to dating. The downside is that it ' s not very imaginative, though, and it may come across as slightly lazy: it doesn ' t require much from you in terms of both coming up with the idea and executing (and potentially paying for) it. It ' s also possible that your date will see this as an attempt to get her drunk and sleep with her, so if she ' s made it clear she ' s looking to keep things above board (at least at first), drinks at a bar may give off the wrong impression. This is your lowest-stakes option, so feel free to use it when you are short on inspiration and want to keep things simple, but not when you ' re trying to impress the pants off anyone, so to speak.
