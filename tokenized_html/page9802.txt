eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e x02013 binding protein 1 4e-bp1 is a key downstream effector of mtor complex 1 mtorc1 that represses cap-dependent mrna translation initiation by sequestering the translation initiation factor eif4e reduced mtorc1 signaling is associated with life span extension and improved metabolic homeostasis yet the downstream targets that mediate these benefits are unclear here we demonstrated that enhanced 4e-bp1 activity in mouse skeletal muscle protects against age- and diet-induced insulin resistance and metabolic rate decline transgenic animals displayed increased energy expenditure altered adipose tissue distribution including reduced white adipose accumulation and preserved brown adipose mass and were protected from hepatic steatosis skeletal muscle x02013 specific 4e-bp1 mediated metabolic protection directly through increased translation of peroxisome proliferator x02013 activated receptor x003b3 coactivator-1 x003b1 pgc-1 x003b1 and enhanced respiratory function non x02013 cell autonomous protection was through preservation of brown adipose tissue metabolism which was increased in 4e-bp1 transgenic animals during normal aging and in a response to diet-induced type 2 diabetes adipose phenotypes may derive from enhanced skeletal muscle expression and secretion of the known myokine fgf21 unlike skeletal muscle enhanced adipose-specific 4e-bp1 activity was not protective but instead was deleterious in response to the same challenges these findings indicate that regulation of 4e-bp1 in skeletal muscle may serve as an important conduit through which mtorc1 controls metabolism mtor complex 1 mtorc1 is a principal cellular sensor of nutrient availability that in turn regulates cellular growth and proliferation activated mtorc1 signaling is associated with increased nutrient uptake and decreased autophagy which are often seen in many cancers and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes conversely reduced mtorc1 activity by caloric restriction rapamycin treatment or genetic manipulation extends life span and likely health span in many model organisms 1 x02013 5 however the relevant downstream substrates and key tissues by which reduced mtorc1 signaling provides these benefits remain to be determined two key downstream substrates of the mtorc1 complex s6 kinase s6k and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e x02013 binding protein 4e-bp have been linked to longevity in invertebrates 4 mtorc1 phosphorylation of s6k leads to its activation whereas phosphorylation of 4e-bp inhibits its ability to sequester eif4e 6 x02013 8 although reduced s6k signaling increases energy expenditure and extends life span in mice 8 x02013 10 the fate of mice with activated 4e-bp is currently unknown in addition the specific tissue s in which mtorc1 inactivation mediates longevity and improved metabolic homeostasis has not been determined adipose tissue is a prime candidate since tissue-specific inactivation of the mtorc1 component rptor in this tissue promotes reduced adiposity and subsequently protects against metabolic stress 11 skeletal muscle is another candidate for mediating the metabolic protection afforded by reduced mtorc1 signaling particularly given that activation of the drosophila equivalent of 4e-bp d4e-bp specifically in muscle suppresses age-related tissue degeneration and is sufficient to enhance life span in the fly 12 mtorc1 activity is crucial during muscle development as modulations that blunt mtorc1 activity cause muscular dystrophy while enhanced mtorc1 activity is required for muscle hypertrophy and recovery from injury 13 x02013 17 however sustained activation of mtorc1 in aging animals results in severe myopathy 18 19 suggesting that the effects of mtorc1 activation are tightly regulated and coordinated in skeletal muscle with proper levels of mtorc1 activity important for both response to injury and long-term tissue function in aging animals skeletal muscle and adipose tissue share a number of intrinsic functions in the regulation of energy homeostasis first they are both derived from the same mesenchymal stem cells with brown adipocytes in particular sharing a common precursor cell with skeletal muscle cells 20 second muscle and adipose tissue are both major sites of thermogenesis oxidizing fatty acids and dissipating energy as heat via the action of uncoupling proteins 21 third both tissues exhibit plasticity adapting to either oxidative or glycolytic metabolism as their main energy source as needed 22 x02013 24 finally genetic reprogramming of transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis leads to muscle fiber transformation or a white fat x02013 to x02013 brown fat phenotypic switch which is ultimately correlated with an alternation in energy expenditure 24 x02013 27 mice lacking 4e-bp1 have a significant reduction of adipose tissue and an increase in whole-body energy expenditure while mice lacking both 4e-bp1 and 4e-bp2 reverse this phenomenon 28 suggesting that the tissue-specific effect mediated by different 4e-bp family members in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis might be masked in whole-body knockout mice to elucidate the factors downstream of mtorc1 signaling that systemically coordinate energy homeostasis in vivo we generated transgenic mice overexpressing a constitutively active mtorc1-nonresponsive form of 4e-bp1 29 in either skeletal muscle or adipose tissue we demonstrate that enhanced 4e-bp1 activity in skeletal muscle leads to increased oxidative metabolism and protects mice from diet- and age-induced whole-body metabolic dysfunction in contrast activated 4e-bp1 in adipose tissue sensitized mice to diet-induced obesity with insulin resistance to test the role of mtorc1-dependent regulation of 4e-bp1 in energy homeostasis we generated 4e-bp1 transgenic mice with mtor phosphorylation site mutations threonine to alanine at amino acid positions 37 and 46 tg-4ebp1mt mice to yield a constitutively active form of the protein ref 29 and supplemental figure 1a supplemental material available online with this article doi 10.1172/jci77361ds1 the expression of the transgene is repressed by a loxp -flanked stop codon cassette tissue-specific expression of cre excises the repressive element and permits expression from the potent caggs promoter-enhancer therefore we could study both cell-autonomous and non x02013 cell autonomous mechanisms of 4e-bp1 activities regulated by mtorc1 dependency in whole-body energy homeostasis the cre recombinase enzyme under the control of the mouse fabp4 promoter fabp4-cre or the muscle creatine kinase promoter ckmm-cre was used to selectively induce transgenic 4e-bp1 expression in mouse adipose tissue or skeletal muscle refs 30 31 and supplemental figure 1 b x02013 d for simplicity we refer to these mice as tg-4ebp1mt-fat and tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice respectively both fabp4-cre and ckmm-cre are expressed at a late stage of adipose and skeletal muscle differentiation thus we could study the role of 4e-bp1 in the maintenance of mature adipocytes and skeletal muscle fibers and determine how the genetically modified target tissues regulate whole-body energy expenditure both mouse lines yielded viable and fertile mice in transgenic mice in which 4e-bp1mt protein is overexpressed 4e-bp1 migrated faster than endogenous mouse 4e-bp1 which we attribute to mtorc1 nonresponsiveness supplemental figure 1 b and d transgenic 4e-bp1mt protein showed increased binding to eif4e which in turn reduced eif4e association with eif4g supplemental figure 2 a x02013 d global protein translation was not altered in 4e-bp1 x02013 activated skeletal muscle supplemental figure 2 e x02013 g suggesting that cap-independent translation control is compensatory this is consistent with prior observations in an independent 4e-bp1 transgenic mouse line in which acute activation of 4e-bp1 in normal thymocytes did not impede global protein translation 32 in contrast acute activation of 4e-bp1 in akt-induced t cell lymphoma markedly reduced protein translation 32 notably endogenous 4e-bp1 expression was upregulated in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mouse skeletal muscle supplemental figure 1 b and e d4e-bp is a known dfoxo target in drosophila 12 33 in addition we detected induction of foxo1 expression at both the protein and mrna levels supplemental figure 3 this suggests positive feedback regulation with 4e-bp1 promoting foxo1 expression which in turn leads to enhanced transcription of 4e-bp1 mrna while both groups of 4e-bp1 double-transgenic mice developed normally we found that tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice exhibited reduced body weight figure 1a and supplemental figure 4a at 2 months of age tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice weighed significantly less than control mice 19 less for males and 17 less for females the difference was not a result of feeding supplemental figure 4 b and c and we did not detect a difference in igf-1 or growth hormone levels supplemental figure 4d and data not shown suggesting that changes in hormone levels do not underlie the small body size of tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice correlated with the decrease in body weight there was a reduced lean body mass in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice figure 1b moreover male tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice had significantly lower plasma glucose levels than control mice 152 x000b1 18.0 mg/dl versus 173 x000b1 25.4 mg/dl respectively supplemental figure 5a nonetheless tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice exhibited comparable glucose homeostasis to control mice including a normal insulin response and glucose clearance rate on a normal chow diet supplemental figure 5 b x02013 e there was also a slight reduction in body weight for male tg-4ebp1mt-fat mice coupled to increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance figure 1a supplemental figure 4a and supplemental figure 5 next we examined the quantity and quality of adipose tissue in 4e-bp1 double-transgenic mice the major fat pads including visceral fat surrounding reproductive organs inguinal fat and brown fat on the shoulder all exhibited no difference in weight when normalized to body weight in both groups of 4e-bp1 double-transgenic mice supplemental figure 6 histological analysis of white adipose tissue from tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice revealed a marked reduction in cell size and a decrease of subcutaneous fat deposits under the skin whereas there was no effect in tg-4ebp1mt-fat mice data not shown the reduction of cell size in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice was restricted to white adipose tissue as brown adipose tissue was not affected figure 1 c and d supplemental figure 7 and see below previously transgenic mice with whole-body knockout of 4e-bp1 were reported to undergo a white-to-brown adipose transition generating beige fat 24 notably we detected an induction of pgc1a transcription in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mouse inguinal fat supplemental figure 8a however we did not observe either multilocular adipocytes figure 1d or enhanced ucp1 expression in visceral and inguinal fat pads supplemental figure 8b moreover expression of the peroxisome proliferator x02013 activated receptor x003b3 coactivator-1 x003b1 pgc-1 x003b1 target fndc5 which is secreted from pgc-1 x003b1 x02013 overexpressing skeletal muscle and controls white adipose transformation 34 did not change in 4e-bp1 x02013 activated skeletal muscle supplemental figure 17a of note we observed increased expression of ucp1 and cpt1 x003b1 in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mouse brown adipose tissue which might contribute to their increased metabolic rate as discussed below supplemental figure 8c and figure 2d taken together these data demonstrate that adipose-specific induction of 4e-bp1 does not alter the intrinsic characteristics of adipose tissue while skeletal muscle x02013 specific activation of 4e-bp1 non x02013 cell autonomously leads to white adipose atrophy next we characterized the cell-autonomous effect of 4e-bp1 activity in skeletal muscle quantitative magnetic resonance showed a decrease in lean mass proportional to reduced body weight in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice supplemental figure 9 this finding is consistent with our observation of reduced muscle fiber size and a small but detectable increase in the frequency of central nuclei in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mouse skeletal muscle supplemental figure 10 since enhanced expression of autophagy genes is associated with muscle atrophy and these genes are known targets of foxo1 35 36 we examined their expression of the 6 genes tested 4 exhibited significantly increased expression furthermore we detected increased levels of the autophagic marker lc3-ii isoform supplemental figure 11 tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice showed a reduced running capacity on the treadmill supplemental figure 12 a and b however voluntary home cage activity was not affected supplemental figure 12 c and d despite these observations tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mouse skeletal muscle did not exhibit fibrosis characteristic of muscular dystrophy or abnormal glycogen deposition supplemental figure 10a which was observed in the skeletal muscle x02013 specific rptor knockout mice 17 the differences between skeletal muscle rptor knockout mice and tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice are somewhat surprising since a reduced mtorc1 signaling should lead to enhanced 4e-bp1 function and b both mutants have elevated foxo1 expression mice with skeletal muscle lacking rptor or overexpressing foxo1 have both impaired insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis 17 37 however tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice had comparable glucose metabolism to that of control mice and upregulated akt1 expression in skeletal muscle supplemental figure 5 and supplemental figure 13a increased akt1 levels may better attenuate the effects of enhanced foxo1 thereby allowing mice to maintain normal glucose homeostasis for instance upon insulin activation we observed a proportional increase of phosphorylated foxo1 relative to total protein data not shown in addition there was differential expression of foxo1 target genes in skeletal muscle of tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice while atrophy autophagy and gluconeogenesis-associated genes were induced we did not detect enhanced expression of genes encoding cell cycle oxidative stress or dna repair components supplemental figure 13b these results demonstrate that unlike inactivation of rptor in skeletal muscle which causes progressive dystrophy transgenic activation of 4e-bp1 in mouse skeletal muscle results in atrophic muscle and attenuates physical performance while maintaining normal glucose homeostasis and metabolism in skeletal muscle histological sections we observed an increase of intramuscular fat in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice supplemental figure 10a using quantitative magnetic resonance we also detected an increase in whole-body fat which may be attributable to the skeletal muscle phenotype supplemental figure 6b and supplemental figure 14 this is surprising since accumulation of intramuscular fat at least coupled to increased white adipose tissue mass and higher serum-free fatty acid levels is highly correlated with insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes however calorie restriction and exercise also lead to an increase of intramuscular fat with a reduction in white adipose tissue and normal levels of serum-free fatty acids 38 x02013 42 furthermore athletes or calorie-restricted model organisms are insulin sensitive having higher metabolic rates and extended health span consistent with the latter scenario tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice had comparable basal leptin and glucose levels and serum lipid profiles and more importantly retained insulin sensitivity supplemental figure 5 supplemental figure 14c and supplemental figure 15 there are 4 defined muscle types characterized in mammals type i type iia and type iix predominantly use oxidative respiration for energy production while type iib mainly uses glycolysis 43 44 overexpression of akt1 in skeletal muscle causes muscle hypertrophy and increased type iib muscle glycolytic fibers 15 even though there was an induction of akt1 expression in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mouse skeletal muscle immunofluorescence revealed an increase of oxidative muscle a finding confirmed by enhanced troponin i slow and mhci expression figure 2a and supplemental figure 16 moreover protein levels of pgc-1 x003b1 which regulates mitochondrial biogenesis 45 46 were enhanced even though mrna levels were not altered figure 2 b and c we speculate that activation of 4e-bp1 promotes pgc-1 x003b1 translation there was also a differential enhancement of pgc-1 x003b1 target genes in 4e-bp1 x02013 activated skeletal muscle supplemental figure 17 the fact that some but not all target genes were induced may reflect differential expression of transcription factors coactivated by pgc-1 x003b1 there was a marked increase in mitochondrial dna copy number as well as enhanced whole-body oxygen consumption and energy expenditure in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice which correlated with increased oxidative muscle fibers figure 2d supplemental figure 16e and supplemental figure 18a consistently mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates measured in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria were both high in adp-stimulated respiration state iii and maximal uncoupled respiration fccp figure 2e and supplemental figure 18 c and d interestingly state iii respiration rates of tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mouse mitochondria were enhanced with a lipid substrate palmitoyl-coa plus carnitine and carbohydrate substrates pyruvate and succinate but they were selectively reduced with glutamate a similar phenomenon has been observed in rapamycin-treated wild-type mice 47 mtorc1 has been linked to enhanced glutamine metabolism via suppression of sirt4 in cancer cells 48 therefore we checked the expression of sirt4 but did not find any change figure 2 f and g moreover tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice have comparable respiratory quotient rq values as quantified by oxygen consumption and co 2 generation and a similar circadian transition to those of control littermates supplemental figure 18b taken together these results indicate that activation of 4e-bp1 in skeletal muscle directly contributes to increased oxidative metabolism in mouse skeletal muscle and leads to white adipose tissue atrophy which consequently enhances whole-body energy expenditure since there is altered fat distribution in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice on normal chow we next examined their behavior in response to a high-fat diet hfd challenge although the weight accumulation in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice was similar to that in littermate controls in response to overnutrition supplemental figure 19 the basal glucose levels were significantly lower and the glucose clearance rate was improved basal level of glucose 200 x000b1 29.8 mg/dl versus 221 x000b1 27.1 mg/dl in males and 155 x000b1 20 mg/dl versus 172 x000b1 23.5 mg/dl in females figure 3a and supplemental figure 20 moreover tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice maintained insulin sensitivity figure 3 b and c supplemental figure 20d and supplemental figure 21 tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice exhibited comparable insulin levels to control mice on a hfd supplemental figure 20c and they remain sensitive to insulin signaling which likely can be attributed to increased total akt expression in skeletal muscle supplemental figure 13a conversely adipose tissue x02013 specific activation of 4e-bp1 sensitized female mice to hfd leading to increased weight gain and more severely impaired glucose tolerance figure 3 supplemental figure 19 and supplemental figure 20 next we examined whether improved glucose homeostasis in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice correlated with improved fat metabolism we found that tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice gained more fat than control mice on a hfd supplemental figure 22 however upon hfd feeding littermate control mice exhibited elevated serum cholesterol and triglycerides whereas tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice maintained their lipids at lower levels that were comparable to those of animals on normal chow figure 4 a and b moreover mice placed on a hfd exhibit white adipocyte infiltration into brown adipose tissue 49 50 we found that brown adipose tissue of tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice was preserved and that the expression of brown adipose ucp1 was comparably higher than that in controls on the hfd regimen figure 4c and supplemental figure 23 as described above tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice have improved serum lipid profiles on a hfd the hfd often induces abnormal accumulation of triglyceride in the liver steatosis which further deteriorates fat metabolism we examined the livers of 4e-bp1 double-transgenic and control mice by oil red o staining to detect lipid accumulation histological analysis of tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mouse liver clearly revealed marked protection against hepatic steatosis figure 4d in contrast activation of 4e-bp1 in adipose tissue did not prevent brown adipose tissue loss or alter the development of hepatic steatosis on a hfd figure 4 c and d and supplemental figure 23 these data from hfd-fed mice with induced obesity and insulin resistance reinforce the concept that muscle-specific 4e-bp1 activation non x02013 cell autonomously regulates fat metabolism consistent with observations that tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice maintained insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis on a hfd their metabolic rate was also maintained at a higher level supplemental figure 24a moreover hfd usually blocks rq switch during the circadian cycle tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice were protected from this supplemental figure 24b the pgc-1 x003b1 targets associated with uncoupling ucp2 and ucp3 were further induced in the skeletal muscle of tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice a finding that correlated with an enhanced metabolic rate supplemental figure 25 interestingly we observed gender-dependent behaviors in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice as male tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice tended to eat less and female tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice tended to be more active supplemental figure 26 we have shown that activation of 4e-bp1 in skeletal muscle instead of adipose tissue suppresses fat metabolic dysfunction associated with hfd next we investigated whether activation of 4e-bp1 in skeletal muscle also protects mice from age-induced metabolic dysfunction the loss of skeletal muscle mass sarcopenia with age is associated with higher mortality in the elderly 51 x02013 53 sarcopenia often leads to frailty resulting in a decreased metabolic rate and increased risk of insulin resistance 54 we found that tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice unlike their littermate control counterparts preserved their muscle fiber size with advanced age figure 5 a and b supplemental figure 27 and supplemental figure 28 b and c in addition whereas whole-body oxygen consumption declined in mice with age tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice maintained higher levels of whole-body oxygen consumption figure 5c rq is usually reduced during aging in control mice 55 whereas 24-month-old aged tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice exhibited rq levels comparable to those observed at 6 months of age supplemental figure 29 decreasing metabolic rate is usually associated with an increase in adiposity we observed age-induced obesity in the control aging cohort while tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice maintained body weight and adiposity during aging supplemental figure 28 because ucp1 expression was increased modestly in the brown fat pads of tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice supplemental figure 8 b and c we investigated the fate of brown fat in more detail loss of x0201c browning x0201d in brown adipose tissue has been correlated with increasing age 56 57 at 17 months of age we found marked white adipocyte infiltration in the brown fat pads of control mice strikingly this infiltration was not apparent in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mouse brown adipose tissue at the same age figure 5d moreover tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice have improved insulin sensitivity compared with that of aged control mice figure 5e there was reduced a glucose tolerance mainly due to increased insulin serum level in aged male control mice figure 5 f and g similar to previously reported observations 58 in contrast tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice had insulin serum levels comparable to those of their younger counterparts and maintained improved glucose tolerance compared with that of aged controls thus tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice are protected against age-induced metabolic decline both cell autonomously and non x02013 cell autonomously activation of 4e-bp1 in skeletal muscle protects mice from either diet- or age-induced white adipose tissue accumulation and metabolic rate decline when we screened for secreted myokines that might contribute to increased energy expenditure in 4e-bp1 x02013 activated skeletal muscle we discovered that expression of fgf21 was significantly increased figure 6 a x02013 c and supplemental figure 30a correlated with this observation the serum level of fgf21 was also higher in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice figure 6d in adipose tissue fgf21 has been shown to regulate ppar x003b3 activity which contributes to enhanced metabolic activity in adipocytes 59 we observed increased expression of ppar x003b3 in both white and brown adipose tissue figure 6e as described above white adipose tissue size was decreased and brown adipose tissue was preserved during hfd feeding or aging in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice we also observed decreased expression of genes involved in fatty acid and transgenic synthesis in white adipose tissue figure 6f while there was increased expression in thermogenesis genes in brown adipose tissue figure 6g on normal chow a similar phenomenon was observed in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mouse liver in which there was a reduction of srebp1c expression which regulated de novo lipogenesis and its target gene expression supplemental figure 30 b and c administration of fgf21 in obese or diabetic mice has been reported to increase x003b2 -oxidation in both adipose and liver tissue 59 x02013 62 there was no significant differential expression of x003b2 -oxidation genes in normal chow x02013 fed tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice supplemental figure 30c and supplemental figure 31 a and b however after 4 months of hfd feeding we detected increased fgf21 expression in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice supplemental figure 31c and markedly increased expression of x003b2 -oxidation genes in the skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue but not in liver supplemental figure 31 d x02013 f since there is rapid skeletal muscle growth during the first week of postnatal development 63 activation of 4e-bp1 at this early stage might impair skeletal muscle growth and lead to a compromised metabolic phenotype this raises the question of whether the phenotypes detected in the tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice were a result of differences during postnatal development or adulthood to determine whether activation of 4e-bp1 in adult skeletal muscle directly triggers an enhanced metabolic rate without interfering with skeletal muscle development we crossed tg-4ebp1mt mice with hsa-cre-er t2 mice 64 to generate an inducible 4e-bp1 transgenic mouse model tg-4ebp1mt-er for adult skeletal muscle x02013 specific activation we induced transgenic 4e-bp1 expression at 2 months of age by daily injection of tamoxifen for 5 days which activated hsa-cre-er t2 to excise the loxp -flanked stop codon cassette of the 4e-bp1 transgenic allele figure 7a and monitored body weight lean mass and metabolic rate at 4 6 and 9 months of age western blot analysis of 4e-bp1 induction in mouse skeletal muscle confirmed the efficiency of hsa-cre-er t2 x02013 mediated removal of the regulatory domain of the 4e-bp1 transgenic allele and induction of 4e-bp1 expression figure 7b induced 4e-bp1 activity in adult skeletal muscle clearly did not interfere with skeletal muscle mass buildup as shown in body weight and lean mass measurements figure 7 c and d interestingly tg-4ebp1mt-er mice which have induced 4e-bp1 activity in adult skeletal muscle for 4 months had an increased metabolic rate comparable to that of tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice at 6 months of age figure 7e and correspondingly increased type i muscle gene expression in skeletal muscle supplemental figure 32 furthermore there was induction of fgf21 expression in the skeletal muscle acutely activated by 4e-bp1 this increase in metabolic rate occurred without affecting skeletal muscle mass in tg-4ebp1mt-er mice indicating that 4e-bp1 is directly involved in the regulation of oxidative metabolism and that fgf21 is likely mediating improved systemic metabolic homeostasis in response to activation of 4e-bp1 taken together these results provide a comprehensive assessment of the consequences of enhanced mtorc1-nonresponsive 4e-bp1 activity in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue leading us to conclude that activation of 4e-bp1 in skeletal muscle is a potent regulator of systemic whole-body metabolism muscle 4e-bp1 is also a promising therapeutic target to treat diet- and age-induced metabolic decline since the acute activation of 4e-bp1 is sufficient to increase energy expenditure our data provide robust genetic evidence that the beneficial effects of mtor-dependent regulation of 4e-bp1 activity are associated with skeletal muscle rather than adipose tissue enhanced respiratory activity in tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice was apparent both in skeletal muscle and brown fat while the former is likely due at least in part to enhanced pgc-1 x003b1 activity the non x02013 cell autonomous effects on brown fat likely derive from increased fgf21 expression and secretion from skeletal muscle while we can not rule out a model whereby brown fat levels are enhanced due to secondary effects of reduced subcutaneous white fat to maintain body temperature this seems unlikely since inactivation of rptor in skeletal muscle also leads to white adipose tissue atrophy without an increase in brown fat or any changes in body temperature regulation 17 instead we favor a model whereby a a myokine signal is transmitted from the skeletal muscle of tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice to brown fat or b altered metabolism of skeletal muscle leads to metabolic changes that are interpreted differently by the heat-producing tissue previously the mtorc1 pathway was implicated in the regulation of adipogenesis as inactivation of mtorc1 by rnai knockdown of rptor or treatment with rapamycin was found to reduce adipocyte differentiation 11 conversely preadipocytes lacking both 4e-bp1 and 4e-bp2 exhibit increased differentiation in vitro 28 data from mice lacking 4e-bps are conflicting perhaps due to genetic background differences or tissue-specific effects of 4e-bp family members knockout of 4e-bps results in a lean phenotype in the c57bl/6j background and in contrast leads to an obese phenotype in the balb/c background 28 65 in addition 4e-bp1 single-knockout mice are lean 66 while 4e-bp1/2 double-knockout mice are obese 28 these differences may stem from different tissue-specific responses to 4e-bp family members in the regulation of metabolism a similar phenomenon has been observed in mice chronically treated with rapamycin which leads to hepatic inactivation of mtorc2 resulting in impaired fat metabolism and increased adiposity 67 here we show that 4e-bp1 activation is only beneficial in skeletal muscle whereas the activation of 4e-bp1 in adipose tissue is deleterious upon hfd feeding thus whole-body knockout of 4e-bps or treatment with rapamycin may mask mtorc1-dependent regulation of adipogenesis and energy expenditure we performed our 4e-bp1 studies in transgenic mouse lines on the c57bl/6j background as in previously published studies of genetically modified rptor or s6k1 x02013 x02013 mice and in the rapamycin studies 5 10 11 17 68 to permit a direct comparison of metabolic phenotypes our data indicate that mtorc1-dependent regulation of 4e-bp1 activity in skeletal muscle instead of adipose tissue non x02013 cell autonomously regulates fat metabolism in the context of aging and overnutrition activation of 4e-bp1 in skeletal muscle induces autophagy which in turn results in muscle atrophy similarly whole-body deletion of s6k1 also leads to muscle atrophy 69 x02013 71 perhaps secondary to ampk activation whether autophagy genes are upregulated in s6k1 knockout mice was not addressed both tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice and s6k1 knockout mice are lean and have high energy expenditure autophagy has been shown to be essential for maintaining favorable metabolic parameters in aging for example suppression of autophagy by knockout of atg7 72 or activation of mtorc1 signaling 19 leads to an impaired metabolic rate and age-dependent myopathy whereas transgenic activation of atg5 protects mice from age-induced metabolic decline and extends life span 73 it is possible that mild blunting of mtorc1 signaling in skeletal muscle leads to a sustained activation of autophagy our findings from the tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice thus indicate that elevated autophagy causes muscle atrophy and activates muscle metabolism consequently stimulating fat metabolism and whole-body energy expenditure in the context of overnutrition and aging however a complete block of mtorc1 signaling leads to skeletal muscle deterioration and metabolic defects 16 17 emerging evidence has identified 4e-bps as key translational regulators mediating mtorc1-dependent signaling ribosome-profiling studies indicate that the translational targets of mtorc1 signaling are mainly mediated by 4e-bps 74 x02013 76 consistently of the targets identified from previous studies 74 75 foxo1 and akt1 were both increased in translation in skeletal muscle from tg-4ebp1mt-muscle mice even though the previous ribosome-profiling studies were performed in cell lines our data suggest similar results in vivo moreover calorie restriction induces d4e-bp activation in the fly which causes the selective translation of top mrnas indicating that enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis is a key underlying mechanism of 4e-bp x02013 dependent life span extension 77 here we also found enhanced mitochondrial respiration with increased pgc-1 x003b1 translation in 4e-bp1 x02013 activated skeletal muscle suggesting that the beneficial effects of 4e-bp x02013 regulated metabolic homeostasis are evolutionarily conserved enhanced mtorc1 activity has been associated with glutamine addiction in cancer cells as either reduced mtorc1 signaling or a depleted glutamine supply suppress tumor growth 48 78 x02013 80 a recent study in a mouse model of leigh syndrome found that repression of mtorc1 by rapamycin treatment in wild-type mice suppresses mitochondrial state iii respiration rates in the presence of glutamate 47 consistent with the current view that mtorc1 positively regulates glutamine metabolism we observed that blunted mtorc1 activity via 4e-bp1 activation specifically suppresses glutamine metabolism while enhancing the utilization of other tca cycle substrates 81 hence 4e-bp1 activation may have therapeutic potential as a cancer treatment reduced mtor signaling mediated by rapamycin leads to a significant extension in life span and health span 5 the downstream effectors of these exciting phenotypes are yet to be fully resolved deletion of one mtorc1 target s6k1 leads to life span extension but to a lesser extent 10 the metabolic phenotypes reported here for 4ebp1mt-muscle mice suggest mtorc1-dependent regulation of 4e-bp1 in skeletal muscle as another potential conduit through which these beneficial effects might be mediated upon aging a constitutively active mutant form t37a and t46a of human 4e-bp1 cdna was placed downstream of a loxp-gfp-3xstop-loxp cassette under the control of a chicken x003b2 -actin promoter the gfp-stop cassette prevents expression of the 4e-bp1 transgenic allele transgenic mice were crossed with mice expressing ckmm-cre 30 or a fatty acid x02013 binding protein 4 promoter fabp4-cre 82 to induce 4e-bp1 transgene expression in skeletal muscle or adipose tissues respectively hsa-cre-er t2 mice 64 were bred with tg-4ebp1mt-er mice
