Southwestern Salmon Tacos with Chipotle Sour Cream | The Splendid Table   For these simple tacos, made with soft flour tortillas, I rely on quickly cooked salmon fillets seasoned with avocado salsa and topped with a spicy-smooth chipotle sour cream—you can whip it up in an instant. Canned chipotle peppers are great to have in the pantry. They add vibrancy to so many dishes, and once you develop a taste for the fiery chilies, you will be hooked. Cut each avocado in half lengthwise and remove the pit. Carefully scoop the flesh from the shell and dice it. Toss the diced avocado with the tomato, onion, cilantro, and lemon juice. Stir to mix and season to taste with salt and pepper. Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. In a medium sauté pan, heat the oil until smoking over medium-high heat and cook the salmon, fleshy sides down, for 4 to 5 minutes on each side or until cooked through. Transfer the fillets to a platter to cool slightly. Spoon heaping tablespoons of the avocado salsa onto each flour tortilla. Gently flake each salmon fillet with your fingers or a fork. Top the tortillas with salmon, Chipotle Sour Cream, and cilantro leaves. Serve immediately. Chipotle Sour Cream Makes about 1/2 cup Stir together the sour cream, chipotle pepper, and adobo sauce and mix well. Season to taste with salt. Serve right away or refrigerate, if not using soon.
