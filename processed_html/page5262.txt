I have successfully generated the pdf using some 3rd party library,but now i am stuck at the point as to how to display the generated pdf file in the browser using scala template. Any help will be highly appreciated.Thanks in advance. The most simple way is to use a built-in controller method for serving files. Java solution : The  ok  method is overloaded and accepts a file, a stream or a byte array. The Java documentation can be found  here . Scala solution : If you want to have more control over a response you can build it manually. Hereunder you have an example which uses a byte array as a response body: Depending on the way that you hold a generated file you can also use  Enumerator.fromFile()  instead of the  fromStream()  method. You can read more about a whole concept in the Scala  documentation .
