A New Look at the Hydrogen Wave Function | physics4me The first direct observation of the orbital structure of an excited hydrogen atom has been made by an international team of researchers. The observation was made using a newly developed  quantum microscope , which uses photoionization microscopy to visualize the structure directly. The team s demonstration proves that  photoionization microscopy , which was first proposed more than 30 years ago, can be experimentally realized and can serve as a tool to explore the subtleties of quantum mechanics .
