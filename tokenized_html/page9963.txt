county craig t. enoch j. john h. martin madeleine b. johnson for appellant randall yazbeck thomas sterling burke john m. weaver michael w. huddleston dallas for appellee before howell thomas and burnett jj thomas justice this lawsuit involves a business relationship between boy scouts of america bsa and responsive terminal systems inc. rts nearly every aspect of that relationship appears to have been in dispute at the trial court level and the evidence from both sides is inconclusive as to the true understanding between the entities if in fact they ever had a basic consensus regarding their business dealings since we hold that the trial court erred in finding bsa liable under rts 's promissory estoppel and breach of contract claims we reverse and remand this cause in part for a new trial as to bsa 's award of damages for overcharges made by rts to bsa and local boy scout councils we affirm the recovery of overcharges made directly to bsa we reverse the trial court 's judgment with regard to bsa 's recovery of damages on behalf of the local councils and render in favor of rts on that point we further reverse and render as to bsa 's award of attorney 's fees in 1979 bsa the national council of the boy scouts organization moved its headquarters to irving texas in addition to this national office there are over 400 separately incorporated local boy scout councils throughout the united states shortly after moving to irving bsa became interested in computerizing many of its tasks including its communications with local councils and began working with rts toward those ends in november of 1982 the two entities signed an agreement of understanding agreement wherein rts agreed to prepare software for bsa to be used on the 990 series texas instruments computer hardware and other hardware provided by rts this software with one exception was to be supplied to bsa at no charge rts further agreed to pass all rights to such software to bsa for its specific use the agreement also provided that if a local council did not buy its hardware from rts rts could bill the individual council a maximum of 2000 for configuration and installation fees plus travel and living expenses if a council did buy its texas instruments hardware from rts it would receive a fifteen percent discount from the list price following the execution of the agreement rts sold computer hardware to a number of local councils and installed software only for several more then in early 1984 a partial revamping of the internal workings of the bsa led to a shift in the division of the organization which would oversee its computer operations after this shift the director of the newly responsible information systems division susan spalter solicited competitive bids from companies within the computer industry in an attempt to choose one vendor of such products to be used by bsa and recommended to local councils although it is unclear as to when rts was actually informed about this competitive bidding it is undisputed that rts submitted a bid and was rejected in favor of another vendor in late august 1984 within a month of bsa 's rejection of its bid rts filed this lawsuit claiming in pertinent part that bsa had breached the agreement by using the software provided by rts on computer hardware other than that sold by rts and by denying or hindering rts in its efforts to provide configuration and installation services to local councils in the alternative rts claimed that the agreement was without consideration or that such consideration failed in whole or in part additionally rts pled a cause of action under promissory estoppel alleging that bsa had requested that rts maintain an inventory of computer equipment and software in order to serve the local councils in a timely manner and that bsa promised to pay for such equipment and software rts claimed that it was foreseeable that it would rely on such a promise and that rts did in fact rely to its detriment a number of damage formulas were also set forth by rts in its pleadings including lost profits recovery of the software or its monetary value and reimbursement of the reasonable value of computer inventory it had in stock at the time bsa chose another vendor bsa counterclaimed against rts likewise citing a breach of the agreement because of certain alleged overcharges by rts to bsa and to the local councils a trial before the court resulted in rts being awarded 81,150 under both breach of contract and promissory estoppel theories bsa was held to be entitled to a 16,576 set-off because of overcharges both parties were awarded attorney 's fees bsa appealed to this court urging fifteen points of error rts in turn raised fourteen cross-points in an unpublished opinion we reversed the judgment of the trial court and rendered judgment for bsa holding that there was no competent evidence to support the judgment for rts under either breach of contract or promissory estoppel this court also affirmed the trial court 's judgment awarding bsa damages on its counterclaims because we concluded that this court lacked jurisdiction to consider rts 's cross-points in reversing the decision of this court in a per curiam opinion the supreme court held that although we had used the proper test in reviewing a no evidence point this court had erred in holding that there was no evidence to support rts 's recovery based upon promissory estoppel the court held that there was more than a scintilla of evidence to support the trial court 's finding that 1 rts had detrimentally relied on bsa 's alleged promise to name rts as its vendor of choice and 2 bsa had expected rts to maintain an inventory of computer hardware sufficient to meet bsa 's requirement that rts be able to fill orders for local councils within thirty days the supreme court further held that this court erred in dismissing rts 's cross-points for want of jurisdiction because under the court 's simultaneously decided opinion in donwerth v. preston ii chrysler-dodge inc. 775 s.w.2d 634 639 tex 1989 an appellee may complain by cross-points in its brief to a court of appeals of any error in the trial court between the appellant and the appellee without perfecting an independent appeal unless the appellant limits its appeal pursuant to rule 40 a 4 of the texas rules of appellate procedure the court then remanded the case to this court for rulings on bsa 's remaining points of error and rts 's cross-points although a motion for rehearing was filed by rts specifically requesting that the supreme court also review this court 's holding that there was no evidence to support rts 's breach of contract cause of action the court did not address that issue since this court determined in its opinion on motion for rehearing that the trial court 's judgment could not be supported by either a theory of promissory estoppel or breach of contract we did not address the fact that under texas law those two causes of action are mutually exclusive fretz construction co. v. southern national bank of houston 600 s.w.2d 878 880 tex.civ.app houston 1st dist 1980 rev 'd on other grounds 626 s.w.2d 478 tex 1981 neither party raised this issue before the trial court nor was it briefed or assigned as error on appeal therefore we are not at liberty to consider its possible ramifications in this opinion san jacinto river authority v. duke 783 s.w.2d 209 210 tex 1990 since the supreme court has already considered and rejected bsa 's no evidence contention as to rts 's promissory estoppel claim which bsa set forth in its first point of error we will begin our analysis with bsa 's second point of error in which bsa argues that t he trial court erred in awarding rts damages on a theory of promissory estoppel because there are no fact findings that bsa made a promise to rts that rts substantially relied on such promise that it was foreseeable that rts would rely on such promise or that injustice could be avoided only by enforcement of such promise the four factors upon which bsa alleges that the trial court made no findings of fact mirror the elements required to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel as set forth in english v. fischer 660 s.w.2d 521 524 tex 1983 as well as section 90 of the restatement first of contracts we can not agree with bsa that the trial court made no findings of fact with regard to any of the aforementioned elements but it is true that the trial court made no specific finding as to the existence of a promise made by bsa to rts indeed in its brief to this court rts admits that the trial court did not find an actual promise but argues that the omitted finding must be presumed to have been found in support of the trial court 's judgment citing rule 299 of the texas rules of civil procedure that rule states tex.r.civ.p 299 upon a closer reading of rule 299 however it is clear that the provisions of the rule which allow omitted findings to be deemed to support the judgment of the trial court and the case law which rts has cited in this regard only apply to omitted unrequested elements in the case at bar bsa made a specific request for an additional finding of fact that defendant bsa did not promise to purchase any inventory held by plaintiff rts at the time the agreement was terminated this request which was filed with the trial court on july 28 1986 was included in boy scout of america 's request for amended and additional findings of fact and conclusions of law on september 30 1986 the trial court filed its own additional findings of fact and conclusions of law but did not address bsa 's request for an additional finding of fact as to any promise allegedly made by bsa to rts if a party makes a request for additional or amended findings of fact under rule 298 of the texas rules of civil procedure and the trial court fails to make such findings its failure is tantamount to a refusal stretcher v. gregg 542 s.w.2d 954 958 tex.civ.app texarkana 1976 no writ rule 299 allows presumed findings on unrequested and omitted findings it does not permit a finding to be presumed when that finding was requested and refused by the trial judge id at 958 emphasis in the original this stance against a presumption of support is true even in a case such as the one before us where the party that does not have the burden of proof makes an additional request for a negative finding of fact with regard to an essential element of the opposing party 's case in gunter v. pogue 672 s.w.2d 840 tex.app corpus christi 1985 writ ref 'd n.r.e the plaintiffs who were seeking to defeat a no-contest provision of a will had the burden to show that their will contest was brought in good faith and upon probable cause after the trial court filed general findings of fact and conclusions of law the defendants specifically requested the trial court to make a finding on good faith and upon probable cause which the court refused to do on appeal the court of appeals reversed the trial court 's judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the ground that the trial court had refused to make a requested finding on a controlling issue necessary to uphold its judgment and because of that refusal such a finding could not be presumed under rule 299 id see also chapa v. reilly 733 s.w.2d 236 237 tex.app corpus christi 1986 no writ an essential element of rts 's promissory estoppel claim against bsa is that bsa made a promise to rts under texas law the burden of proving all the essential elements of promissory estoppel is on the party asserting the doctrine in re texas mortgage service corp. 761 f.2d 1068 1074 5th cir 1985 since bsa specifically requested a finding of fact regarding the existence of a promise made by it to rts and the trial court refused to make such a finding we sustain bsa 's second point of error in its original appeal to this court bsa presented numerous points of error arguing against the trial court 's judgment that bsa breached its agreement with rts we sustained bsa 's points and for the sake of completeness will reiterate in this opinion our discussion of rts 's breach of contract claims bsa contends that the trial court 's findings that bsa 's and rts 's contract established rts as its vendor of choice and that bsa breached its contract are not supported by competent evidence we agree the agreement states in full the agreement was signed by representatives for both parties the agreement contains no provision whereby bsa promises that rts is its vendor of choice or that it will recommend rts to local councils the agreement itself negates any inference that rts had an exclusive right to sell hardware to local councils by providing for the payment of installation fees to rts for installing software on hardware systems not sold by rts rts contends however that this contract may be supplemented by oral testimony at trial bsa counters by arguing that the evidence of an oral agreement is barred by the parol evidence rule we agree with bsa the parol evidence rule is not a rule of evidence but rather is a rule of substantive contract law hubacek v. ennis state bank 159 tex

the contract contains the following merger clause this is our entire understanding and no other assumptions are valid we hold that the agreement is a valid integrated agreement preventing enforcement of any alleged oral agreement between bsa and rts of course the parol evidence rule does not preclude enforcement of prior or contemporaneous agreements which are collateral to are not inconsistent

tex.civ.app galveston 1947 writ ref 'd n.r.e. we hold that the alleged oral agreement in the instant case is not collateral to and is an attempt to vary the written agreement between the parties consequently the parol evidence rule prevents the enforcement of the alleged agreement that rts is bsa 's vendor of choice in support of its conclusion that bsa breached the contract the trial court also found that bsa had prevented rts from installing and configuring rts-developed software on hardware systems not sold to local councils by rts the agreement provides rts may bill a local council a maximum of 2,000 for configuration and installation fees plus travel and living expenses for each hardware system not sold by rts assuming without deciding that this provision gives rts the right to install software for a 2,000 fee rather than merely setting the maximum fee if and when such installation occurs we hold that there is no competent evidence to support the finding that bsa prevented rts from installing software in reaching this conclusion we have considered only the evidence tending to support the finding viewing it and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the finding alm v. aluminum co. of america 717 s.w.2d 588 593 tex 1986 there is no evidence in the record that bsa informed local councils not to hire rts to install software or that bsa took any other action to prevent councils from hiring rts rts can not rely upon parol testimony that bsa stopped naming rts as its vendor of choice for hardware as evidence that bsa prevented it from installing software because we have held that there is no competent evidence of a contractual duty that bsa designate rts its vendor of choice consequently the judgment of the trial court can not be supported under a theory of breach of contract having sustained bsa 's appeal of the trial court 's finding of liability against it under both theories of promissory estoppel and breach of contract we do not find it necessary to review bsa 's remaining points of error concerning damages issues attorneys fees and other actions of the trial court with regard to its judgment since our holdings as to promissory estoppel and breach of contract are dispositive of bsa 's appeal burkart v. health tennis corp. of america inc. 730 s.w.2d 367 371 tex.app dallas 1987 no writ see tex.r.app.p 90 a except as to bsa 's last point of error which does not deal with the agreement in its final point of error bsa alleges that the trial court erred in finding that rts did not charge bsa or the local councils for software support not actually rendered the record shows that bsa as well as a number of the local boy scout councils had service contracts with rts for maintenance of the computer systems purchased from rts these contracts were separate and distinct from the agreement there was conflicting evidence at trial as to whether rts discontinued this software support to bsa and the local councils after it was informed that rts was no longer bsa 's vendor of choice susan spalter testified that rts refused to provide the support even though its service contracts were still being paid on a monthly basis by bsa and the local councils a representative of rts stated that rts continued servicing the computer equipment and in fact was still providing software support at the time of trial a court of appeals will uphold a trial court 's findings unless they are manifestly erroneous and without any evidence to support them or are so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to

the trial court found that rts did not charge bsa or the local councils for software support not actually rendered since this finding is not so against the evidence presented as to reach the hinojosa standard for reversal we overrule bsa 's final point of error it is likewise unnecessary for us to review rts 's cross-points seeking further damages under its breach of contract claim because of our previous holding that the trial court 's judgment that bsa breached the agreement was not supported by competent evidence the remainder of rts 's cross-points deal with the trial court 's award of a set-off of 16,576 to bsa as well as attorney 's fees the 16,576 figure is a combination of an overcharge of 1,955 by rts to bsa for preloading application programs on hardware purchased from another vendor and a number of overcharges by rts to local boy scout councils in its findings of fact the trial court found that rts sold texas instruments computer hardware to certain local boy scout councils without including in the price of the hardware the minimum fifteen percent discount contracted for under the agreement the court further found that the local councils were corporations or entities separate and distinct from bsa that the obligation to pay for the computer hardware furnished by rts was with the local councils and not bsa and that the local councils did in fact pay rts and other hardware vendors directly included in its conclusions of law was the trial court 's judgment that bsa had the legal capacity to sue and to recover damages on behalf of the local councils rts 's fifth counter-point complains of these latter conclusions of law contending that bsa had no right or standing to bring a cause of action for any damages allegedly suffered by the local councils we

contract but cites graham v. turcotte 628 s.w.2d 182 tex.civ.app corpus christi 1982 no writ for the proposition that courts have allowed recovery in circumstances where some special relationship is shown to exist in graham the plaintiffs contracted with a bank to obtain a monthly payment real estate lien note a clause contained in the note required the plaintiffs to pay a certain percentage of the principal and interest still owing on the note as attorney 's fees if the note ever had to be turned over to an attorney for collection after numerous late payments the plaintiffs were held to be in default by the bank and eventually paid a fairly large sum in attorney 's fees the plaintiffs filed suit against several defendants including the collections attorney alleging in part that they had been forced to pay excessive attorney 's fees the court held that since the plaintiffs had a contract with the bank as to the payment of attorney 's fees and the bank had a separate contract with the defendant attorney regarding his fees there was no privity of contract between the plaintiffs and the attorney and therefore the plaintiffs could not recover in their action against the attorney in so holding the court noted that the plaintiffs had not only been unable to show privity of contract between themselves and the defendant attorney but also had failed to show any special relationship which would entitle them to sue the attorney directly id at 184 it is clear from the facts of graham as well as a review of the cases cited by the graham court in support of its special relationship exception that the special relationship it is referring to is that of a third-party beneficiary to the contract bsa argues that it has the capacity to sue and recover damages on behalf of the local councils because it has a special and unique relationship with the local councils and as a matter of efficiency and economy it is better situated to pursue claims against rts on behalf of the local councils since we hold that this is clearly not the type of special relationship contemplated by the graham court and because under general contract law bsa may not maintain an action based upon any harm suffered by the local councils which were neither parties to the agreement nor to this lawsuit we sustain rts 's fifth cross-point of error and reverse the trial court 's award of damages to bsa for overcharges made by rts to the local councils in two combined cross-points rts urges this court to hold that there was no evidence or in the alternative insufficient evidence to support the trial court 's finding that rts overcharged bsa by 1,955 for preloading application programs on hardware purchased from another vendor we will first address rts 's no evidence point in doing so we will consider only the evidence and the inferences tending to support the finding and will disregard all evidence and inferences to the contrary stafford v. stafford 726 s.w.2d 14 16 tex 1987 under a no evidence point it is fundamental that the trial court 's fact findings must be upheld if there is more than a scintilla of evidence in support thereof stedman v. georgetown sav loan ass n. 595 s.w.2d 486 488 tex 1979 the undisputed evidence presented at trial was that bsa paid rts a 2,000 fee for the preloading of application programs which took approximately an hour susan spalter testified that rts had indicated to bsa that support charges and software charges would be billed to bsa at a rate of 45 an hour in considering only this evidence and the inferences therefrom we conclude that there is some evidence to support the trial court 's award of 1,955 in damages to bsa we now turn to rts 's insufficient evidence point to determine whether the evidence is factually sufficient to support the trial court 's findings we will consider all of the evidence in the record that is relevant to the fact being considered pool v. ford motor co. 715 s.w.2d 629 633-636 tex 1986 this court may set aside the verdict only if it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust cain v. bain 709 s.w.2d 175 176 tex 1986 rts presented evidence at trial that it invoiced bsa for 2,000 in connection with the preloading work at issue and that bsa paid that amount without protest it was further established by rts that the last paragraph of the agreement provided that rts could bill 2,000 for configuration and installation fees bsa maintained in its argument to this court that it was not aware at the time it paid rts 's invoice that the preloading work had taken only an hour bsa also pointed out that the 2,000 fee provided for in the agreement was a maximum amount and not a set fee to be paid in every case considering all of the foregoing evidence we conclude that the evidence is factually sufficient to support the trial court 's finding that rts overcharged bsa by 1,955 for preloading application programs on hardware purchased from another vendor therefore we affirm the trial court 's award of that amount to bsa the trial court held in its additional findings of fact and conclusions of law filed subsequent to its original judgment that bsa was entitled to recover attorney 's fees rts then requested an additional finding of fact which stated that bsa did not present its claim upon which its counterclaim was based to rts at any time prior to the trial of this lawsuit the trial court refused to make this additional finding rts now complains in a cross-point of error that the trial court erred in awarding bsa attorney 's fees because there is no basis in law for such a recovery it is rts 's contention that bsa did not make a presentment of its claim with regard to overcharges and that such a presentment is required by the provisions of section 38.002 of the texas civil practice and remedies code there is no evidence in the record of such a presentment and bsa does not assert that it presented a claim for overcharges to rts instead bsa argues that under section 38.002 a defendant is not required to make a formal presentment before filing a counterclaim this is simply not the law the language of section 38.002 does not make a distinction between plaintiffs and defendants with regard to its mandatory language of presentment further in dobbins v. redden 759 s.w.2d 477 tex.app san antonio 1988 no writ
