Tamara  are small  egg -like enemies found exclusively in the  Tree Zone  of  Super Mario Land: 6 Golden Coins . They are only located in the fourth room of the  beehive , which is the third level of the Tree Zone, where they sit in unusual plant-like pods and rise and fall to attack Mario. Mario can easily defeat one by  jumping  on top of it or shooting a  fireball  at it.
