did the english people back in the 1400s have swear words that they used in speech askhistorians i was watching game of thrones and noticed that they dropped the f-bomb a lot and i was wondering if the people of 1400s used the same or different words than the ones we use currently there are a lot of x27 naughty x27 words in chaucher shit piss pussy in the vagina sense prick penis or sexual intercourse etc but it x27 s debatable how offensive they were considered at the time on the one hand chaucher writes disclaimers about using profane language for characterisation but on the other hand x27 mild x27 swear words like x27 piss x27 appear in the wycliffe bible around the same time so can x27 t have been that shocking when he x27 s using mimicking the speech of ordinary people in his prose chaucher uses what people today may well consider swear words so we can gauge from that evidence that people did use these terms but in an age before plumbing where people defecated out of windows on to the street could a word like x27 arse x27 have been the least bit shocking much more likely to shock would be blasphemous swear-words the original meaning of x27 swear word x27 referred to this as to say an oath is to x27 swear x27 and invoking god x27 s name was considered to be part of an oath in canterbury tales chaucher does not use blasphemous language freely like he does with scatological words indeed he refers to it at a remove condemning it in his text thou blasphemour of cryst with vileinye x27 .. many a grisly ooth thanne han they sworn and crystes blessed body they to-rente fuck btw isn x27 t attested until the 16th c. in writing but if it was very taboo it mayn x27 t have been written on any documents that survived until long after it became current the first use of fuck is a bit of a cop out because it x27 s cod-latin non sunt in celi quia fuccant uuiuys of heli where fuccant fuck they the monks are not in heaven because they fuck the wives of the town of ely. there are multiple prior routes to get x27 fuck x27 in to english before this as there are related words in scandinavian languages and middle english judging my chaucher chosen because he x27 s the shakespeare of this era he writes for and about a range of social classes scatological x27 dirty x27 swear-words were not very shocking but religious ones were ps i have modernised all spellings in non-quoted text for the sake of clarity i have never seen chaucer spelt chaucher. is there a reason for that you take chaucer as representative of english commoners but both of your quotes come from the pardoner x27 s tale which adds another degree of separation as a thoroughly hypocritical churchman the pardoner would pay lip-service to condemning blasphemy we x27 d need to see numerous examples of this blasphemy-at-a-remove through other characters before concluding that chaucer himself treats blasphemy that way i x27 d check the miller and reeve for blasphemous oaths i x27 d honestly be surprised if there were none to op x27 s question i know the wife of bath says that one of her husbands told her she had the prettiest cunt middle english queynte he x27 d ever seen and she promises one of the old husbands that he x27 ll have cunt enough at night time by x27 cod-latin x27 do you mean fuck was a loan word of sorts i ask because i thought fuck had anglo-saxon origins pussy in the vagina sense prick penis or sexual intercourse i doubt these are true given that the oed x27 s first citations for both senses is well after chaucer x27 s death i know this question is specifically about english people but the wu ming foundation an anarchist collective then known as luther blisset wrote a wonderful little essay on the history of swears in romance languages in response to the allegedly anachronistic language in their novel q which remains one of my all-time favorite pieces of historical fiction to elaborate on the idea of blasphemy this was considered a violation of the second commandment and considered a serious offense a manual intended to aid priests in administering confession that bishop walter cantilupe issued for the diocese of exeter in 1240 elaborated on its gravity furthermore he should see whether he has perjured god x27 s name especially while looking at or touching holy objects i.e. the equivalent of our swearing on a bible which often happens at courts of assizes in this regard teach them about the evils of perjury or whether he has sworn oaths without reason especially by swearing on the head or limbs of christ which people do from habit ignoring the wisdom of solomon who said x27 let not thy mouth be accustomed to swearing x27 etc ecclus 23:9 swearing by god x27 s blood or god x27 s wounds the latter eumphemized by the 16th century into zounds was apparently popular i x27 ve seen a source 15th-century english as i recall but i can x27 t place my fingers on at the moment that mentions that when people swear on god x27 s/christ x27 s head body limbs wounds etc. they are in fact subjecting to the torments of his passion again swearing by the devil also occurred devil take you that sort of thing very much like our god damn you. the punishments for blasphemy could be severe as we learn from the biography of the pious king louis ix of france later sainted and after whom st. louis mo is named written in the early 1300s by his friend jean de joinville the king loved god and his sweet mother so well that if anybody within his reach used any foul language or lewd oath about god or his mother the king had them very severely punished thus i saw him have a goldsmith at cesarea put on a ladder in his shirt and breeches with the entrails of a pig hung round his neck right up to his ears i heard it said after i returned from overseas that he had a burgher of paris seared through the nose and lips for the same offence but i did not see it the holy king said i would gladly be branded with a hot iron providing that all lewd oaths were done away with in my kingdom. i was about twenty two years in his company and never heard him swear by god nor by his mother nor by his saints but whenever he wanted to affirm anything he used to say truly it was thus or truly it shall be thus. i never heard him use the devil s name unless it was in some book where the name was mentioned or in the life of the saint of whom the book was speaking and a great disgrace it is to the realm of france and to the king who allows it that a man can hardly open his lips without saying devil take it it is a great abuse of language to consign to the devil a man or woman who was given to god at baptism in the household of joinville whoever uses such an expression pays for it with a buffet or a slap and such bad language has been almost entirely put down i x27 m sure that there were but really don x27 t know about the 1400s if you go slightly later though there are lots of great insults in shakespeare c. 1600 one of my favorites is zounds which to us sounds silly but was incredibly offensive at the time it is a contraction of his wounds and refers to christ on the cross heavy stuff there are many many more great shakespearian insults and curses they x27 re beautiful careful though this it is thought to be an acronym for fornication under consent of king this acronym was placed on placards to be posted on doors of couples who had permission from the king to have sex is known to be untrue which kind of puts the whole blog entry under suspicion 1.1m readers 1.3k readers online aug 28 2011 cake day
