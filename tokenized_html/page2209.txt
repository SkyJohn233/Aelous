girls by creating a new line of toys and marketing them to girls ages 5 and up we 're not sure why lego did it as legos are for both boys and girls however it spawned the many lego friends sets we have today the new brand launched with 23 sets at the time and they feature five main characters set in the fictional town of heartlake city of course each of those five characters andrea emma mia olivia and stephanie have their own distinct personalities and interests giving young girls a new character to relate to so whether your little girl liked to adventure at the beach or prefers to paint the landscape the idea is that there was/is a lego friends character for her to latch onto see also disclaimer heavy inc. is a participant in the amazon services llc associates program and other
