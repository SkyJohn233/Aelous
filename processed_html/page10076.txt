About Us | Òlàjú Art Group Òlàjú Art Group was established in 2015, by founder and director, Obafemi Ogunleye, as a member-driven platform to advance the development of African arts  &  culture.  The Group  is comprised of artists, curators, collectors, and members of the general public with an interest in cross-cultural exchange centered on Pan-African heritage.  Our mission  is to raise awareness of critical issues concerning West Africa and beyond through the use of contemporary art.

In addition to the Festival, we partner with organizations to develop education-based programming.
