julia and nikolai thank you all for being patient with us we have received many gift registry related questions that we could not answer because it took us a while to register the first good news is that we have finally done it if you have misplaced the password for our website i.e. the one on the invitation and can not access the information then you can just visit macy s or target these registries contain the large bulk of the gifts for which we registered the second great news that we want to share is that we are buying a house that s why it took us so long to register and are getting ready to move at the end of july hopefully we can get the house in order before the wedding so we can throw pre-wedding parties there we ll keep you posted no comments posted in historical house hunting picking vendors for our wedding was the worrisome part can they really be trusted are they any good are they even going to show up to the wedding unfortunately although we ve already picked our vendors and signed the contracts none of these questions will get answered until the day of the wedding with all of the scary stories we ve heard from people we can not help but wonder if we ve made good choices here in our search we did of course ask everyone we could for recommendations but in the end we relied on on-line reviews the most i was so grateful for the www.weddingwire.com this site is amazing and the availability of reviews was very helpful then there are also these good sites www.bridesclub.com and www.theknot.com dealing with vendor contracts was a completely unexpected twist to this story there was not a single contract that we did not ask to tweak to make it more customer-friendly most of the vendors really try to guard themselves and the contracts are often more about protecting the vendor than the consumer for example one photographer made his contract to say that if the photographs are lost e.g. due to hardware damage or other disaster he is not responsible and still gets paid the full amount seriously yet this same vendor had a huge paragraph on how he needs to be fed at specific times describing this in a lot of detail while some vendors were willing to work with us others would not back down needless to say we did not hire such vendors it did not take us too long to pick our photographer dj and the florist finding an officiant however was surprisingly difficult most of the officiants who had good reviews and looked likable were already booked after a rather long search we did manage to find one with good reviews whom we both liked but guess what in his entire career as an officiant he has never used a contract so he was a bit surprised and maybe even slightly offended when we insisted on having one i did have to write it myself though here is the list of our main vendors if you know any of them please let us know what you think photography maxine toh this is the only one we picked because of a friend s recommendation dj jonathan with elation entertainment officiant pastor martin west no comments tags picking vendors for the wedding wedding vendor contract what to look for in wedding vendors posted in wedding preparations the beauty of having a smaller wedding i.e. 60 to 80 guests is having a wider range of places to consider even the more expensive locations still end up being within the budget so much choice lots of choice choice is also the downside of having a smaller wedding nikolai and i visited over a dozen places that is after we sorted through dozens on the web from the more expensive locations such as the fairmont olympic hotel hotel 100 and the salish lodge and spa at snoqualmie falls to the less expensive ones such as the plateau club and the apulent beach club we ve considered them all our experience has been great at each one of them with wonderful customer service and willingness to provide as much information as we needed given that we set our wedding for august we did not want to take too long to pick a venue as a result over a two-week period we had a mad dash through venues with a goal to pick one as soon as possible in the end considering the availability the interest factor and the convenience of the space we picked the space needle oh and another reason was their food it is catered from the sky city restaurant at the top of the space needle and everything we tried there was delicious this venue just felt right and so appropriate for seattle given the large number of out-of-town guests that we are expecting we could not think of a better location well we did consider salish lodge but it felt a little too small for our party so far our experience with their event planners has been great and we are really looking forward to working with them how many venues did you look at before selecting one no comments tags searching for a wedding venue in seattle space needle wedding posted in wedding preparations while we discussed getting engaged in detail during the summer of 2011 the proposal itself came as a big surprise i was not expecting it and even told my friend rebekah who as it turns out knew about it and helped nikolai pick the ring that i did not think he was going to do it any time soon as she later shared it took her a lot of willpower not to spoil my surprise thanks rebekah during our 2+ week trip through germany and austria we stopped at the village of hohenschwangau to see the famous neuschwanstein castle on our first morning there nikolai set me down on a chair on our balcony overlooking the castle making sure that i have a great view and got down on one knee his speech was concise but beautiful i wish i had written it down right away as the end did not stick in my memory thankfully most of it did stay with me to those of you who know me you ll laugh if you find out that i actually cried a bit yes i the sceptical guarded julia actually could not help crying i then cried again when i broke the news to my parents and again when we talked to his parents and again at some other point which i don t remember now i am curious who else cried during the proposal and if you did were you expecting to cry at such a moment no comments tags engagement at neuschwanstein castle posted in historical no comments tags julia and nikolai get engaged posted in historical no comments posted in
