Debbie Swisher The Matrix of Liberty poster was designed to capture the beauty and magnificence of the National Monument to the Forefathers coupled with educational facts and sprinkled with encouraging quotes. The National Monument to the Forefathers is a beautiful thing to behold but the message behind the monument is priceless.Morality, Law, Education,  &  Liberty under the watchful care of Faith are the components that make up the Matrix of Liberty. Our forefathers knew that without these components a free society would cease to exist. That when applied, the Matrix would produce Christian character without which, there would be no basis for a free and just nation. Fellow Americans must be made aware of that fact and of those components if we care to remain a free society.

Average Rating ( 4.90  Stars): Donna Harrison December 13th, 2019 This is in no way a judgement of the artist. This is about the quality of the print, which I am very displeased with. The colors are muddy and the darker tones are way too black and run together not providing separation of the gold and brown tones. The face of the horse from the eyes to the snout looks like shades of black, with almost no shades of brown. I bought the match to this print a few years back so, aside from how the image on the website, I know what this print should look like. Unless fineartamerica can provide me with a reprint, I am going to request my money back. Buck OHerin December 13th, 2019 I was not happy with the quality of the print and missed the deadline to return it. Doubt I would buy again from Fine Art. Sue Hallett December 13th, 2019 Fall Foliage and timber Perfect combo Allyson Bianchi December 13th, 2019 My favorite Fripp Island photo ever. I know exactly where this is on the island and it makes me smile every time I look at it. Mary Phillips December 12th, 2019 Photo received damaged- matte paper had a few wrinkles that took off the black color.  Had to reorder with different less sensitive paper. Very disappointing... Judith Cirves December 11th, 2019 WonderfulÂ¡ Ever wondered how a government by the people and for the people with liberty under God is created?It's done through Faith, with Morality, Education, Law, and Liberty based on Biblical teachings and steeped in the love of God as depicted in a monument dedicated to our forefathers.The 'Matrix of Liberty' poster was created to bring awareness to this grand monument so that it's message is no longer hidden. Posters can be purchased and used as a teaching tool and displayed in classrooms, homes and/or government offices.
