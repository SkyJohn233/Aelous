Indeed data from our current work at St Mary’s hospital indicates that about 5% of patients attending the AED who drink at or below recommended limits (men: 4 units/day, Women: 3 units/day) present with conditions that they believe are related to alcohol consumption.   However, the authors imply that increased levels of alcohol consumption among older people should not increase mortality. Previous research (ONS, 1999)2 has found that up to two thirds of accidental deaths among women aged over 65 are as a result of falls, and that alcohol consumption may be implicated in the aetiology of falls (Bell et al. 2000)3. At St Mary’s AED considerable attention has been placed on identifying the extent of alcohol use among people presenting to the AED. Data on patients aged over 65 who present with falls suggests that over one third drink excessively. The extent to which alcohol may interact with the concurrent medication (such as benzodiazapines and antidepressants) of older drinkers remains uncertain, but we believe it is likely that such interaction may contribute to both mortality and morbidity.   1.
