sous-vide cooker yoghurt incubator 5 steps with pictures 7,692 112 9 featured this sous-vide cooker was inspired by burke lashell 's sous-vide cooker for less than 40 and some of the comments under it it 's sufficiently different that i thought it deserved its own instructable and having just stumbled on geedeekay 's greek yoghurt from scratch it occurs to me that this would be ideal for incubating the yoghurt culture overnight too here 's what you need with links for buying them in the uk i also bought 4 long self-tapping screws of the same diameter as those supplied with the project box but a couple of inches longer which i used to fix the box to the acrylic sheet total cost ~£80 including the cooler itself teachers did you use this instructable in your classroom add a teacher note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson put the acrylic sheet on top of the cooler draw round the top using a sharpie then use a jigsaw to cut out the shape cut a slot in the side of the project box so you can snugly slot in the temperature controller i used a hacksaw and a stanley knife use a 36mm hole saw to make the hole for the cup boiler update after a few months of use the cup boiler burned itself out so i replaced it with a different immersion heater this one can drop right through the 36mm hole so i can now run the cooker with less than a full tank of water when required drill four small holes for the long self-tapping screws which will fix the project box to the acrylic sheet put four big blobs of sugru near the corners of your acrylic sheet to hold it snugly on top of your cooler leave it all for 24 hours for the sugru to cure the pump should be connected directly to the incoming mains so that it runs continuously while the cup boiler should be controlled by the thermostat the thermocouple needs connecting to the relevant terminals on the temperature controller too the instructions supplied with the unit i bought were a little cryptic due to their hasty translation from chinese but the gist is as follows in practice the 300w heater is only sufficient for maintaining the temperature of the water bath not for heating it up from cold you 'll need to part-fill it will cold water then boil the kettle and/or heat some pans of water to get it close to the right temperature to start with the water level needs to be quite high too almost to the top of the cooler to ensure that the water heater is actually immersed in the water obviously the pump should dangle in the water while you 're cooking so that the water circulates and does n't develop hot spots the thermocouple should be in the water too so the controller knows when to turn the heater on and off as for the actual sous-vide cooking techniques start with this basic guide to sous-vide then google around ask people and experiment and enjoy so there you go — a perfectly functional sous-vide cooker also yoghurt incubator for around £80 bon appétit did you make this project share it with us 10,121 enrolled we have a be nice policy please be positive and constructive 1 year ago although my incubator is n't as complex it uses a thermometer one outside and one inside i am using it to grow broths of bacillus l bacteria that produce a natural selective insecticide a 20w cfl does not release enough ir heat to raise the temp to 25-35 degrees c. ideal for these bacteria 4 years ago on introduction excellent work it 's a great variation on the sous vide theme great instructable burke 4 years ago you could use a submersible aquarium heater its built in thermostat might remove the need for the temperature control unit but might still have burn out problems if not kept submerged reply 4 years ago that is an excellent idea i did n't look into aquarium heaters because i thought they would never be powerful enough even the 300w cup boiler that i 've got is pretty weak for such a large quantity of water but it turns out there are 300w aquarium heaters on the market yay br as it 's submersible i would be able to use the cooker with less water in it which would be considerably easier if i do n't actually need the full capacity i.e most of the time br one possible problem is that the heaters i 've found so far all seem to have a built-in thermostat which of course i would want to by-pass — my steaks need hotter water than any tropical fish it 's definitely worth a look for the next iteration though thanks for the idea br oh yeah one other possible problem — like the submersible pump the submersible heater wo n't be designed to run at 60ºc so it may also burn itself out at some point but that 's no reason not to try reply 4 years ago on introduction i somehow missed it was 60c think i saw yoghurt and assumed 60f aquarium heaters have been known to short out the thermostat befor now and make fish soup so they may well be up to doing the higher temperature external thermostats used to be common in fish keeping so check before you buy/ dismantle that max setting is n't permantly on to allow for this if you do need to disasemble i 'd recomend dow corning 781 portable water safe high modulus silicon sealant when reassembling i use it instead of aquarium sealant i strongly suspect it is the same stuff with a different lable and its half the price or less reply 4 years ago on introduction i think i would hesitate to plunge a 240v electric unit into water if i 'd opened it and attempted to re-seal it i would just have to shop around for a thermostat-less heater or get one with a permanently on setting as you say thanks for the sealant tip too but i think i would use my trusty sugru for that it 's rated up to 180ºc and i have n't yet found a material that it does n't stick to and i have plenty of it kicking around at home 4 years ago on introduction i wonder if something similar would work for proofing yeast bread dough reply 4 years ago on introduction hmm not sure with that because the bread dough increases greatly in size during the proofing also it usually only needs a short-ish time 30-60 minutes i think so it 's easy enough to put it in the oven on a very low heat br this project is a temperature controlled water bath so to incubate the yoghurt you 'd have to put a lid on the glass jar and drop it into the water not really feasible with bread i do n't think 4 years ago on introduction great work i love seeing new instructables like this that build on past ones thank you for taking the time to share this and for linking back to your inspiration excellent stuff following views comments contest book instructable
