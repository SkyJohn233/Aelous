culture of kerala wikipedia the culture of kerala has developed over the past millennia influences from other parts of india and abroad 1 2 it is defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity sustained by the malayali people 3 modern kerala society took shape owing to migrations from different parts of india and abroad throughout classical antiquity 2 4 5 kerala traces its non-prehistoric cultural genesis to its membership around the ad 3rd century in a vaguely defined historical region known as thamizhagom a land defined by a common tamil culture and encompassing the chera chola and pandya kingdoms at that time the music dance language first dravida bhasha dravidian language 6 then tamil and sangam a vast corpus of tamil literature composed between 1,500 2,000 years ago found in kerala were all similar to that found in the rest of thamizhagom today 's tamil nadu the culture of kerala evolved through the sanskritization of dravidian ethos revivalism of religious movements and reform movements against caste discrimination 7 8 9 kerala showcases a culture unique to itself developed through accommodation acculturation and assimilation of various faculties of civilized lifestyle native traditions of classical performing arts include koodiyattom a form of sanskrit drama or theatre and a unesco -designated human heritage art kathakali from katerumbu story and kali performance is a 500-year-old form of dance drama that interprets ancient epics a popularized offshoot of kathakali is kerala natanam developed in the 20th century by dancer guru gopinath meanwhile koothu is a more light-hearted performance mode akin to modern stand-up comedy an ancient art originally confined to temple sanctuaries it was later popularized by mani madhava chakyar other keralite performing arts include mohiniyaattam dance of the enchantress which is a type of graceful choreographed dance performed by women and accompanied by musical vocalizations thullal thirayattam padayani

clapping and ishal vocalizations margam kali is one of the ancient round group dance of kerala practiced by saint thomas christians 11 however many of these native art forms largely play to tourists or at youth festivals and are not as popular among ordinary keralites thus more contemporary forms including those heavily based on the use of often risqué and politically incorrect mimicry and parody have gained considerable mass appeal in recent years citation needed indeed contemporary artists often use such modes to mock socioeconomic elites in recent decades malayalam cinema yet another mode of widely popular artistic expression have provided a distinct and indigenous keralite alternative to both bollywood and hollywood the ragas and talas of lyrical and devotional carnatic music another
