reduce your fabric stash by cutting it up quilting sewing creating i love fabric and collect it really i have pictures on this post which show just how much fabric i have since i wrote that post i have bought more fabric and finished many projects i like the stash of yardage i have for new projects but i have way too many bits and pieces from previous sewing if i love it i save it in a project box for another similar work but i have a new way of dealing with leftover fabrics from finished projects i suggest you reduce your fabric stash by cutting it up what do i mean by cutting up your fabric stash am i about to decimate my accumulation with a pair of garden shears yes ha ha just kidding let me explain by giving you an example i made my husband an apron for christmas from chicago blackhawks fabric one of his favorite teams i had already made one for my son in law i still had some fabric left so i cut out another apron and i stored it right next to my sewing machine it is all set it just needs to be sewn up i am not shoving that fabric back into my stash to be forgotten on that same chair aka storage i have the apron i cut out for my book club this sunday i had some fabric left so i cut out two actually both are on top of the blackhawks fabric when i make one i might just get around to making three it does n't hurt to have some extra aprons all made up for spur of the moment gifts i bring aprons as hostess gifts a lot sometimes i will give one to my daughter to round out a shower present she is giving after i got done cutting out the aprons i still had scraps remember the goal is to not put more back into my stash i want to cut it up i make bibs all the time i give them to my grandchildren to take home i keep some here and i send them to people instead of a card when they have a new baby if i have about a yard i try to cut out an apron if it is less than that i try to cut out at least one side of a bib i finished the call of the wild table runner so i was working on using up those scraps here i am seeing what is big enough for a bib i will also cut up the batting for the bibs thus reducing the amount of leftover batting i keep if there is not enough fabric for an apron or a bib i see if those pieces will work for making purse sized kleenex covers i cut out an outer fabric and a liner and stack them in a box here you can see i am trying to get a bib and a kleenex cover the martini glass fabric is my pattern it works really well in this case there was n't enough fabric for the bib as the seam allowance is not included on the pattern sometimes i need to just sew so i can ponder a design or just feel like i have accomplished something i have had up to 35 kleenex covers made i 've given them out at book club or to all the nurses at a favorite medical office with flannel fabrics i cut the scraps into 5 inch squares and store them i have made two quilts using the left over squares and two dozen burp cloths it really made the process so much faster to have the squares cut out then there are fabrics i ca n't or do n't want to save in any way i had leftovers from the misprint fabric challenge so i just put in on my longarm table i cut it into manageable pieces and use them on the side of a quilt to test my stitches think of favorite small projects you make again and again when you are finished with it do n't always put it in your stash cut it up or do whatever you want with it but i am trying not to add so many scraps to my stash whatever you do just do n't send your scraps to me i have enough of my own to cut up want to see to see what else i am pondering plus some quilt humor check out my facebook page like the page and join the conversation if you want to keep reading my blog you can subscribe to do so type your email address in the box and click the create subscription button you will receive a verification email my list is completely spam free and you can opt out at any time if you enjoyed this post i bet you would like this one as well on having a big stash filed under fabrics my sewing room tags fabric stash welcome to chicagonow meet our bloggers post comments or pitch your blog idea my passions are quilting and sewing add to that french spanish books swimming travels new restaurants yoga and chocolate and you have me all of these are best shared with family and friends except for chocolate don t touch my chocolate.you can email me at quiltingsewingcreating gmail.com completely spam free opt out any time most recent post snowy day projects most recent post design restart most recent post the year i spent only 23 at target
