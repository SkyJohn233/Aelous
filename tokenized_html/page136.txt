appleton today at the opening reception of my show i 'll be working on a piece i started while standing in a parking lot across the river from pullman 's a local restaurant with an outdoor patio i do n't remember why i did n't finish that day maybe rain clouds showed up maybe the geese chased me out i do remember that the geese were quite nasty and anyone who knows me knows about my bird phobia anyway it 's time to pull it out of the archives brush it off and attempt to finish although i 'm happy with the green awning the red umbrellas and the bridge in the upper right hand corner it definitely needs some paint in the foreground to portray sky trees and red umbrellas in the water reflected in the river stop down and watch me attempt to resurrect this little painting this afternoon from 4 to 6 p.m there will be refreshments served and lots of cool artwork in the gallery to see when you get tired of watching me you know what they say about watching paint dry comment on or share

well bigger than my usual paintings anyway so i had some sanded pastel paper dry mounted to a piece of foam core for this little experiment i wanted to try my hand at a seascape because i like the big vistas i love being able to see a distant horizon well i messed around and messed around with it never quite happy not knowing what i needed to do to make it interesting or pop as they say after layer upon layer of pastel washed down with turpenoid i finally put it to rest for awhile thinking maybe someday i 'll know more of what i need to know to finish it was such a nice big piece of paper mounted to board i did n't have the heart to toss it out this year a friend of mine commissioned me to do a seascape for her condo in naples florida i 've spent a lot of vacations looking at the ocean and photographing the ocean but never have i painted the ocean on location so i felt i needed to do some practice pieces i pulled out the old board which had been washed down with turpenoid to a pretty blue and sprayed with fixative for storage but not much else going on with it i began working on it again but still struggled to make it something more than turquoise water yellow orange sunrise blue sky with clouds boring as it turned out one day i stepped into my studio and found the pastel laying face down on the floor it had fallen off the easel no big deal it was n't even close to finished however because it was mounted on foam core and had apparently hit something sharp on the way down it was dented seriously dented with no hope of repair or ever becoming something i could sell lesson learned never mount on foam core it 's way too soft and easily damaged now i have a half-finished painting that is truly practice only so i began to have fun i put away my reference photo and just had at it laying on bold strokes of color thinking about balance color harmony temperature and composition things we artists are supposed to think about but sometimes do n't when we 're being slaves to the photo voila i love it it 's going on my wall i do n't particularly care if it 's dented comment on or share this article by on 8/19/2015 3:38:23 pm comment on this i 'm always thinking i need to blog about my art more but i never get around to it until something exciting happens because i 'm a painter not writer you should probably thank me for sparing you anyway two of my pieces have been accepted into richeson 's create -a wisconsin art show it 's such a pleasure to be included in the exceptional exhibits richeson 's puts on comment on or share this article by on 1/28/2015 2:36:55 pm comment on this i am very pleased to announce that my paintings belgian beauty and ruffled feathers received the meritorious entry designation in the richeson75 small works 2015 competition

2014 first place other media award for my pastel portrait little lexie i am grateful jack richeson co. for providing me the opportunity to exhibit in this show my intention with this piece was to paint a portrait creating depth and nuance by layering black white and gray pastels in the same way a color pastel portrait is created the entire surface is covered in pastel thus generally considered a painting versus a sketch by pastel artists i was drawn to the pose because of her beguiling almost secretive expression which hints at wisdom beyond her young age comment on or share this article by

of 7 days i painted consistently every day this particular painting sums up how i feel mixture of sad it 's over because now i have to find new goals to keep me motivated and on task and yet thrilled with what i learned i wrote down just a few of the revelations 30 paintings in 30 days september 2014 what i learned i learned how to organize a new palette how to set up my easel quickly for different size supports and how to maintain a clean brush supply for painting every day without spending washing brushes everyday i learned that mineral spirits are not my friend and other than toning my canvas i need to put it away other mediums are only slightly more useful try to stay out of it i learned that every painting evolved from a slightly different technique i.e i used many of the processes i ve learned from different teachers over the years not just one and that s ok i learned that i need to study with someone who is adept with the palette knife because i really stink when it comes to using one i learned that close up references work better for smaller formats i learned that when painting daily paintings from photos versus from life i need to be even more aware of edges and color in shadows because the tendency is to copy what i see rather than what i know was there but the camera didn t see i learned if you listen to wisconsin public radio daily you stay very well informed it must be osmosis it becomes white noise when i m in the zone but i still retained a lot good when you 're holed up in the studio every day and the world continues to spin without you

those days when everything i do is more of a struggle on second thought i 'm going to blame it on the rain i 've always love the photo because of the reflection from the tube on my grandson 's skin and the gestures of both kids comment on or share this article by on 9/29/2014 7:00:44 am comment on this new day -maybe it will rain but i 'm hoping not because there 's pinky golden light on the horizon a lot like what i see looking out my window this morning in the reference photo there is a small boat in the water on the right reflecting the sun 's rays it was too small to depict on this small 8 x 10 but i 'm going to paint this scene on a larger panel and include the boat it was such a peaceful yet dramatic scene comment on or share this article by on 9/27/2014 5:37:35 pm comment on this roman facade is the front of a little trattoria in rome the buildings were so old some crumbling yet so beautiful we loved sitting for hours in sidewalk cafes to people-watch and no one chases

perinneal i used to have it growing on a wild hillside behind my house in midsummer i loved how the brilliant color would show through the all the dark green of weeds and trees it eventually died out so i tried planting some this spring unfortunately the hungry rabbits got it before next daylight oh well i 'm happy to keep the rabbits fed at least that 's apparently what the rabbits think comment
