had tickets for a gig the band announced they had cancelled the gig but rock city continued to sell tickets until the day of the actual show caused a great deal of confusion also the security staff are horrible and treat fans terribly at shows.for a rock venue they 're more concerned with money grabbing than providing a good experience went to watch darkness venue not bad ladies toilets could be better e ciggarettes should be banned think they should leave exits acssessable as if in an emergency the place was that full you would have got hurt getting out great venue for live bands we did n't bother with the support act and the place was packed when we arrived so we 're at the very back did not spoil the night mind as its only about 2000 capacity great atmosphere no trouble whatsoever 90 's rock/ alternative club night on the 1st friday of every month is awesome this has its own entrance on the side of the main club.tip if you plan visiting one of rock citys main club nights take photo id as this is needed no matter your age to access the club your id is checked and scanned into the security system as you enter fantastic live music venue really enjoyed seeing the awesome local rock metal band fahran there good facilities and great sound quality well worth the drive up from london plus we stayed in the ramada hotel in the city centre which was a 3 minute walk away from the venue if you re after a fancy nightclub this is not the place for you if you re after great music fantastic atmosphere cheap drinks and a great time this is your place love going to gigs here great
