lucky to get confirmation from her that it was him who was at the helm it 's a breakthrough because that was an unknown until now it puts zaharie right in the mix co-pilot fariq abdul hamid in the second week after the plane went missing malaysian airlines chief ahmad jauhari yahya said initial investigations found the final words were spoken by fariq abdul hamid the co-pilot he also said the words were all right good night a message which raised suspicion as it did not follow the protocol of giving the call sign weeks later malaysian officials revealed they had not yet confirmed who delivered the final sign-off and that the words were actually good night malaysian 370 on sunday it emerged that zaharie had used a flight simulator at his home to plot a path to a remote island deep in the southern indian ocean where much of the recent search operation has been focused that discovery has rekindled suspicious that the pilot may have hijacked the plane and deliberately steered it off course but hishammuddin hussein malaysia 's acting transport minister rejected reports that police now considered the pilot as the prime suspect we should not entertain conspiracy theories he told malaysia 's the star newspaper on monday more than three months have now passed since the plane disappeared and no physical trace of it has been found despite a massive multi-national search effort investigators on tuesday concluded that the missing flight mh370 was most likely not damaged and was still flying a controlled flight path for hours after it lost contact according to the new york times studying malaysian radar data and the electronic handshakes recorded by inmarsat the british satellite firm senior officials told the newspaper it was unlikely the plane had descended to 45,000 feet above its maximum altitiude before sharply descending as originally reported the comprehensive review found that malaysian radar was not precisely calibrated to the level required to support earlier conclusions made about the plane 's altitude x201c there x2019 s nothing reliable about height x201d martin dolan the chief commissioner of the australian transport safety bureau told the newspaper the new evidence is believed to have been behind the recent decision to shift the search area southwest by hundreds of miles on monday malaysia airlines british commerical chief admitted that the hunt for the missing plane could take decades due to the size and topography of the search area hugh dunleavy a former ministry of defence employee who became the airline 's director of commercial operations in 2012 said he believed something untoward had happened to the plane i think it made a turn to come back then a sequence of events overtook it and it was unable to return to base mr dunleavy told the evening standard i believe it 's somewhere in the south indian ocean but when a plane hits the ocean it 's like hitting concrete the wreckage could be spread over a big area and there are mountains and canyons in that ocean i think it could take a really long time to find we 're talking decades he added mr dunleavy who is originally from ealing defended his company 's initial response to mh370 's disappearance people say 'why did n't you work quicker but you 're calling pilots explaining the situation waiting for them to send out pings doing the same to the next plane then the next and it 's four in the morning you do n't have 50 people in the office only a couple an hour goes by frighteningly quickly x2013 you realise that the missing plane is now another 600 miles somewhere else however he criticised the malaysian government for taking so long to reveal that the missing plane had turned back over the malay peninsula towards the strait of malacca i only heard about this through the news mr dunleavy said i 'm thinking really you could n't have told us that directly malaysia 's air traffic control and military radar are in the same freakin building the military saw an aircraft turn and did nothing they did n't know it was mh370 their radar just identifies flying objects yet a plane had gone down and the information about something in the sky turning around did n't get released by the authorities until after a week why i do n't know i really wish i did related partners the best way to transfer money overseas in australia top news
