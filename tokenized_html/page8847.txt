1257ad become faction leader mountandblade just installed 1257 ad and was hoping to play up in the british isles i always enjoy scotland in these games is it possible to become faction leader of an existing faction scotland for example or do you have to start you own faction to become king bonnie king jonass of the true scotsmen och aye laddie i like your enthusiasm you can x27 t take over an existing faction in 1257ad which is a shame you can start out as a faction leader in the medieval conquests mod which is meant to be a successor to the 1257 mod but some people reckon it x27 s even more unstable than 1257 so that might be a problem i haven x27 t really had much trouble with it personally but i might just be lucky too bad would be fun to take over a faction thanks for the insight it x27 s definitely more unstable than 1257 and it x27 s dev has abandoned it some gamebreaking bugs involving kingdom diplomacy and companions it x27 s a huge shame because all of the additions would be awesome if they worked 106k members 362 online jun 3 2009 cake day
