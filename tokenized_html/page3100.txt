ra.a.g.f the ultimate tokyo rabbit cafe connie tsang photography* toronto event photographer toronto event photographer documentary photographer toronto event photographer documentary photographer ra.a.g.f rabbit cafe in tokyo photo connie tsang let 's face it i 'm a single gal in toronto with single gal friends i see cats all the freaking time so as the cat-cafe concept jumped shores from japan to as far as montreal and melbourne the idea of spending valuable time in tokyo petting them seemed increasingly banal then i was told about a rabbit cafe on the border of harajuku-shibuya which sounded pretty cute i could totally do rabbits even though i 've seen many of them in my time albeit at a distance darting around small-town ontario often too hyper and too quick to be caught with the camera i 've unfurled a second too late about the awkwardly named ra.a.g.f rabbit and grow fat cafe works on the same principle as its feline counterpart pay a cover charge to sip a beverage hang out with adorable animals the particular cafe is not your standard storefront deal it 's tucked up on the third floor of a narrow building in a quiet alley steps away from a major intersection in bustling harajuku upon entering you 're immediately greeted by a line of rabbit cages and i guarantee you 'll probably shriek at the sight before greeted by one of the bunny caretakers who by the way speaks only enough english to say please remove your shoes and enter the cafe is small a cozy gated area which looks almost like a nursery play space with a bright spring-like colour scheme tiny kid tables and at the time of my visit a toddler gleefully running after a bunny and squealing rabbit snack and all-you-can-drink juice delivery photo connie tsang my friend jacinta and i step into the tiny gated area and sit down while a girl zips over to us and goes over the english version of the menu stating the rates and available drinks all of which are complimentary at an all-you-can chug service she quickly goes over the rules we are to select a rabbit to play with and it must stay out for a minimum of 15 minutes only one is allowed out at a time as they 're prone to fighting she asks us how long we 'd like to stay and being travellers on a budget we both figure 30 minutes at ¥700 6usd will suffice the clock is set we opt for juice order a bowl of veggie ribbons to bribe the rabbits and rush over to the cages to give a new bunny some human-love-play time rabbit 1 the pressure is immediate to make the right choice from a pool of 20 or so rabbits and with time ticking we had to figure things out fast in a panic we point to a tiny seemingly timid rabbit in the top left cage and clasp our mouths over our hands too adorable well not really turns out this little bunny is a feisty little hell-raiser which is what i 've known of rabbits to begin with so it should n't be a surprise it leaps out of the caretaker 's hands and rips across the perimeter of the space like she 's just taken a hit of cocaine dangling the carrot ribbons in the air does nothing hellraiser rabbit 1 mows down on his own feces photo connie tsang after seeing us on our hands and knees beckoning miss adhd with radishes the staff pieced together a brief she does n't like to eat no shit so after a few minutes of running around and capturing only one still photo of the thing mowing down on its own feces i just sit in one place and swing my head back and forth as if watching a hyper speed tennis match suffering a slight bit of whiplash as a result the thing wo n't stop bouncing around made slightly worse by the trails of poop nuggets deposited at our feet these ones she does not consume nearing the 15-minute mark we are visibly worn like babysitters passed out on a couch after caring for a friend 's kid who we secretly despise we are ready for a switch we scored with the lumbering yet adorable godzilla-rabbit photo connie tsang rabbit 2 we learn from our coked-up bunny experience we ai n't fools so when the staff scoop her up and ask for our next choice we glance at our full rabbit snack bowl and request a slow tired bunny that likes to eat a lot almost immediately she nods bends down to a lower cage and if she does n't grunt she should drags out a rabbit with a body close to the size of a mammoth and a face so chubby its eyes are reduced to slits we are in love our voluptuous new friend is exactly as requested a lazy lumbering sloth who goes to lengths to devour our entire rabbit snack bowl and he does this is what we came for and we love it at this point our 30 minutes are up and despite my itchy eyes and swollen throat indicating a newly discovered bout of rabbit allergies we both are n't ready to go sign up for an additional half hour and spend extended time with the glorious unreal godzilla-sized rabbit as new customers file into the cafe we play fair give them private bonding time happily waste our remaining minutes opening cages and petting our new rabbit buddies and leave the cafe even more giddy than we entered it though only a single rabbit can enter the play area customers are permitted to open cages and pet to their full desires photo connie tsang ps as you can see from the photo above rabbits are available for purchase and yes even rent which seems pretty entertaining in my head but who am i to judge we all get a little lonely once in a while and i 'm sure if i lived in tokyo i 'd surely find a reason to borrow one for a few hours too rates drinks included 30 minutes ¥700 60 minutes ¥1,100 additional 30 minutes ¥550 rabbit snacks ¥150
