Carvalho's partnership with John Terry helped  Chelsea  to their first top-flight title in 50 years during his debut season at the club, with the Blues conceding just 15 goals en route to top spot - still a Premier League record to this day. A second league title followed in 2005-06, and Carvalho made it a hat-trick of Premier League winners' medals as part of a league and FA Cup double in 2009-10 - his final season at the club before joining Mourinho once again at Real Madrid. The Portugal international left Chelsea having scored 11 goals in 210 appearances, including seven in 135 Premier League outings, helping the club to three league titles and two League Cups along the way.
