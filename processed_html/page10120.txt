I &# x2019;m going crazy over here, Gregg is wearing me out! &# x2019; I am not good at this s &# x2014;! I would rather hire somebody. Gregg doesn &# x2019;t wants me to hire somebody, but I &# x2019;m just not good. I &# x2019;m not good at fluffing the pillow; I &# x2019;m good at buying the pillow. &# x201D; RELATED: &# xA0; RHOA &# x2018;s Gregg Leakes Says He Was Ready to Die After Cancer Diagnosis:  &# x2018;I Don &# x2019;t Fear Death &# x2019; Image zoom Mostly, she said his illness has caused a bit of a divide in their marriage. &# x201C;He &# x2019;s changed as a person, his attitude changed, &# x201D; she said.  &# x201C;I feel like that day, I lost my husband. Our whole dynamic changed. Sometimes I forget that he &# x2019;s sick and I need to remind myself because he &# x2019;s so on the edge. He &# x2019;s not nice, but he can &# x2019;t help it. &# x201D; It &# x2019;s reminded her of when they separated back in 2010 and divorced the following year, ending a then 14-year marriage (they would remarry in June 2013).  &# x201C;Back then, I would go upstairs at night and he would go to downstairs to the basement, &# x201D; she said.  &# x201C;Now, he goes to the guest room on the main floor  &# x2014; we don &# x2019;t sleep in the same bed. We &# x2019;ll try to lay in bed together for a couple of hours but he freaks out if we sleep in the same bed. He &# x2019;s like,  &# x2018;I don &# x2019;t want to give you anything! &# x2019;  &# x201C; &# x201C;It &# x2019;s been very tough and very lonely, &# x201D; she continued.  &# x201C;You know how many nights I &# x2019;ve been up there crying? I &# x2019;ve really cried in my room because I was so used to him being there. We &# x2019;ve been together over 21 years. And when we first got married, we were so in love that we got a queen-sized bed and said we never wanted to sleep in anything bigger because we always wanted to be close to one another.  &# x2026; And now he &# x2019;s on an entirely different floor. &# x201D; Close Previous Next Previous Next Close Next                         PEOPLE.com may receive compensation when you click through and purchase from links contained on                        this website.
