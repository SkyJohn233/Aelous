original laravel 3 cache usage storing items in the cache is simple simply call the put method on the cache class the first parameter is the key to the cache item you will use this key to retrieve the item from the cache the second parameter is the value of the item the third parameter is the number of minutes you want the item to be cached you may also cache something forever if you do not want the cache to expire note it is not necessary to serialize objects when storing them in the cache retrieving items from the cache is even more simple than storing them it is done using the get method just mention the key of the item you wish to retrieve by default null will be returned if the cached item has expired or does not exist however you may pass a different default value as a second parameter to the method now fred will be returned if the name cache item has expired or does not exist what if you need a value from your database if a cache item does n't exist the solution is simple you can pass a closure into the get method as a default value the closure will only be executed if the cached item does n't exist let 's take this example a step further imagine you want to retrieve the number of registered users for your application however if the value is not cached you want to store the default value in the cache using the remember method let 's talk through that example if the count item exists in the cache it will be returned if it does n't exist the result of the closure will be stored in the cache for five minutes and be returned by the method slick huh laravel even gives you a simple way to determine if a cached item exists using the has method need to get rid of a cached item no problem just mention the name of the item to the forget method
