reflections of a grady doctor see one do one teach one teaching learning caring growing i got to do one on my 2nd day of ms iii also my 2nd day of neurosx it was the best feeling ever i imagine i was beaming just like smiling student above very neat feeling indeed i love it when i can teach the residents something new whether it is procedural or something simpler like interpreting an ekg equally thrilling beautiful i may have never done an lp but i vividly remember my first im injection when the vietnam vet patient at the va hospital flexed his deltoid muscle at the exact moment i darted the needle in and it flew right back at me my instructor who was one of the first phd nurses and was all of 5ft tall walked around to the the tough young man and told him if he ever treated one of her students like that she would tell his commanding officer he yes mam ed her to death and contritely apologized to me the patient and i became good friends until i moved on to another rotation ah the memories that was a great article btw i m sandeep s brother feel free to whack him on the back of the head whenever he gives too much lip yet again you are eloquently describing something we all in the medical field anyway have experienced first hand i m in the middle ground in veterinary medicine still learning and teaching everyday and nothing feels more inspiring than seeing my students succeed. tell me something good tell me that you like it yeah. chaka khan
