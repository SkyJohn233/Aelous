The Lakers were struggling mightily before Young came into the lineup and there was not another scorer for the coaching staff to rely on. The second unit was sub par and consequently, the burden to score and create offense was put on Kobe Bryant. However, now that Young is back from his injury, the Lakers have an additional option on the court and coach Byron Scott raved about his play to the media,  via Lakers Nation reporter Serena Winters : Byron on Nick Young  He s been good. Two straight games  &  he s given us exactly what we need off the bench.  (on TWC) — Serena Winters (@SerenaWinters)  November 20, 2014 In his two games for the Lakers this season, Young has averaged 16.5 points and 4.5 rebounds per game. His ability to get his own shot gives the Lakers a much needed threat and that puts a lot of pressure on the defense. Although many have criticized Young for his lackluster defensive efforts, he has been very impressive on that end of the court this season. Even though it is only two games, the Lakers have been a far better team with Young in the lineup. Not only has he shown his offensive explosion, but he also is the  missing piece for a Lakers bench that has not performed up to standards this season.  Kobe,  Things Go Good, It s Us.
