Let ' s just put it out there straight away, Jason Derulo is nowhere NEAR ugly...look at those pecs! Here it is! The record breaking tune. Bieber ' s  ' Love Yourself '  has now spent 15 WEEKS in the top ten. Well that came out of nowhere didn ' t it! Coldplay ' s collaboration with Beyonce shot up an incredible 16 places. Another former No.1 still grabbing a spot in the top ten. We still can ' t believe he ' s only 17 years old...HOW?! This girl is climbing the chart like no other artist we ' ve ever seen! After her collaboration  ' Never Forget You '  with MNEK, Zara has continued to dominate the top 40. We ' ve got nothing but LOVE for this song. Jason Derulo ' s voice along with the four Little Mix ladies is a match made in heaven! (Picture: PA) We are here...just waiting for that music video to drop. We REALLY hope its as good as Riri  &  Drake ' s last one! He ' s STILL owning the chart isn ' t he? The question is...WHEN will the man release more music for us to download! Yup, Jonas Blue has OFFICIALLY made it 5 weeks in a row at No.2! We ' ve never seen anything like this! They ' ve done it! That ' s THREE weeks at the top of the freshest chart around. Congrats to the Danish ghetto pop group who are now the longest reigning No.1 of 2016...so far.
