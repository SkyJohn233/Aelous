sylvia travels meeting cutiepiemarzia and pewdiepie at the mall ðŸ™€ðŸ™€ this was first supposed to be me just showing you my day and a little around malaysia but then i bumped into felix and marzia here s a really bad picture of me with the amazing couple i don t have any other pictures but that s alright i was so overwhelmed excited ecstatic and nervous at the same time i have been long before and i ve never expected to have a chance to meet them in real life oh if you didn t know marzia has her own blog that s really amazing i love the pictures she takes and the content she shares with her subscribers if you wan na check her blog out click here so my day started out quite bad as i wanted to go to the newest innisfree outlet opening in klcc kuala lumpur city centre here s some pictures of klcc initially i was planning to go there as the new innisfree was opening and they had their new cushion sets plus they were giving out free stuff to the first 50 visitors it was friday most people had work and school so i decided to go unfortunately the jam from my house to klcc was tremendous and i ended up not being able to make it to get free things oh well after that i decided i wanted to buy some false lashes to give them a go so i visited some drugstores as i don t want to spend too much on them in places like sephora sadly ardell isn t sold here so i just picked up some by cybercolors which is a korean brand i decided to head out to the park to catch some pokemon that s when i bumped into my cousin jarod we decided to head to pavilion as i saw on facebook a few days back they were getting many lures for their pokestops fast forward a little after playing pokemon go for quite a while we decided to get some baskin robbins ice cream as they were having a buy 1 free 1 scoop thing going on after i bought the ice cream on the way down on the escalator i saw a guy who looked strangely familiar then i saw marzia and i was freaking out literally hyperventilating it was just the day before i was watching marzia s newest video on her channel and i m literally looking at them in real life i ran up to them quickly and blurted an awkward hi happy anniversary and was all you guys are in malaysia felix said they kinda kept it a secret and at this point i haven t read marzia s blog yet so i didn t know this was a trip to celebrate their anniversary i managed to talk to them for a bit mostly to felix and i was super nervous my brain was a wreck my heart was beating so quickly and i was shaking they were really friendly i just wish i were able to tell marzia she looked amazing and her dress was so adorable and she is such a big inspiration to me i felt so lucky to be able to see them and take a picture gah after a while i told them they should check out nana s green tea which i reviewed the place click here to check that out they said they would and they went along i was later thinking a bit about asking them if they would like me to show them around a bit as i thought it would be friendly i figured they probably didn t have friends in malaysia to show them around plus i was just taking my boyfriend zac around kl when he was still here he s back in america now -sniff0 i felt a little embarrassed asking this after i knew that this was supposed to be their romantic vacation later when i was home going through my wordpress feed and reading about marzia s post about packing felix politely declined my offer when i went looking for them the second time he said that was really nice of me and marzia was busy filming again so i didn t manage to talk to her i just sort of feel really shy and felt like i was invading their privacy to look for them again i did mention to felix i hope i wasn t invading and he said it was all good they were super friendly i wish i wasn t that nervous and was able to recommend more places and things to try to them when i had the chance i think i ll just leave it here also this was my first time meeting any sort of celebrity so it was really an experience are any of you fans of marzia and felix i certainly am have you met any celebs before tell me in the comments i hope you re having a great day cheers
