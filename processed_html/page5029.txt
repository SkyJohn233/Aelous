Gul Mirror Worlds - Day 5 The Mirror is the World's most popular double handed sailing dinghy, low in price, light, seaworthy and easy to sail, the Mirror quickly achieved its objectives. Probably responsible for introducing more people to the delights of sailing than any other design, some have even gone on to win Olympic medals, the latest being Paul Goodison taking Gold in China. The Mirror is a real proper little boat, with its deep 'sit-in' cockpit, that inspires confidence for sailors of all ages and abilities, easy to sail but a challenge to sail well. Written by Martin Egan on  04 August 2017 . Posted in  2017 Mirror Worlds Latest News Day 5 of the Gul Mirror Worlds, only one more race and the Cornish weather was a bit more like it with a moderate, but shifty wind and sunny intervals. The first attempt at getting Race 12 away failed when, with about 2 minutes to go, a large hole developed near the Committee Boat, and the wind picked up  &  shifted hard left at the pin end. The second attempt, under a 'U' flag, looked, to me, very biased towards the pin, but with seconds to go, it shifted back allowing a clean start. On the beat it paid to go right at first and 'Holy Sheet' sailed by Esme Shepherd  &  Max Phypers from Restronguet lead for the first lap, with the pack in hot pursuit. Esme  &  Max held a narrow lead at the end of the third beat,  but the pressure from behind was too much - Dave  &  Imogen Wade from Northampton SC got past to win with 'Hype', sailed by Archie Hawkins  &  Jack Stevens from Looe SC second. So with all 12 races sailed, Cullen  &  Rowan Hughes from Balmoral SC in Australia were the new Mirror World Champions and were applauded ashore and carried up the slipway in their boat.
