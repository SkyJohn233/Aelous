CE-4-21 insulating sticks are constructed from glass/fiber and resin epoxy foam and have lockable buttons to secure the extendable telescopic sticks. CATU CE-4-21 insulated sticks or poles are generally used with  portable earthing  and  voltage detectors   for working on medium/high voltage substations and overhead lines. The insulating stick is telescopic type permitting folding and extension up to 2 metres for field use. Compliant with IEC 61235, the CATU CE-4-21 stick is made from resin polyester completely insulated up to 90kV for safe working on substations or overhead lines at 11kV, 33kV and 66kV. The insulating stick can be set to the required length by the linesman, cable jointer or MV/HV Senior Authorised Person with the lockable button. CATU CE-4-21 stick can be used with CATU CM-7-10-A to provide an extension insulated length of 1 metre to the pole. Contact T & D for price, delivery and technical support for CATU CE-4-21.
