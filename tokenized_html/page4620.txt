anonymous union with an anonymous struct hello this is my compiler 's information icpc intel r 64 version 14.0.2.144 build 20140120 the source code example is not intricacy this code can be compiled by visual studio 2008 s compiler but icpc reports invalid member for anonymous member class class vect3 has a disallowed member function vect3 a i know the error comes from the anonymous struct in an anonymous union but i just want to use it in that way how can i do hi wang p i can not reproduce the issue with both 14.0 and 15.0 compiler with ia32 and intel64 also i have one concern could you please double confirm the version of your compiler is it an official release version i can not find any release version with a build date of 20140120 for 14.0 update 2 release you may also provide your product name below is an article about the version mapping looks like the linux version has 14.0.2.144 20140120 please help to double confirm i will also try to test the code on linux https //software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-compiler-and-composer-up thanks shenghong hi wang p i have verified the test case on linux and yes i can reproduce the issue you reported however even g++ has the same error without c++11 adding c++ 11 g++ still have some errors less but icpc can pass the test case looks like there are some issue for g++ even in c++11 mode could you please check whether you are testing on linux if yes you may need to enable c++11 let me know whether it works thanks shenghong hi shenghong thanks for your reply it does work i 'm so sorry about my carelessness i should write down my compiler 's instruction icpc test.cpp -o test i have forgotten to enable c++11 the anonymous struct is a part standard of c++11 引文： hi wang p i have verified the test case on linux and yes i can reproduce the issue you reported however even g++ has the same error without c++11 adding c++ 11 g++ still have some errors less but icpc can pass the test case looks like there are some issue for g++ even in c++11 mode could you please check whether you are testing on linux if yes you may need to enable c++11 let me know whether it works thanks shenghong
