Should you hand your pension money to the government? | Money | The Guardian Publicly owned Nest, with its low charges and cost, is causing panic in the pension industry Publicly owned Nest, with its low charges and cost, is causing panic in the pension industry Patrick Collinson Tue 9 Sep 2014  08.43 EDT Last modified on Thu 30 Nov 2017  04.06 EST The pensions industry, for so long riddled with absurd charges and overpaid and underperforming fund managers, finally has a real competitor. It’s called the British government. In a little-noticed technical change slipped out on Monday, the Department for Work and  Pensions  has lifted the cap on contributions into the government scheme it set up in 2012, and said people can transfer in their pension pots from past employers. The move in effect turns the government into a no-nonsense, cheap alternative to the likes of Aviva, Standard Life and Legal  &  General – and underlines just how much the British public has been overcharged until now. From the moment the scheme –  National Employment Savings Trust  or Nest – was set up, the private pensions industry sought to handicap it, hedging it in with a multitude of restrictions. Why? Because it showed up the industry for the overcharging beast it had become. Unlike the private providers, Nest said it could perfectly well manage small contributions that may stop and start (for example, while on maternity leave). It does so without public subsidy, for an annual charge of 0.3% of the person’s money. That number horrified the pensions industry, which has routinely milked members for between 1% and 3% a year – money used to pay fund managers £1m-plus salaries and fat commissions to brokers. It declared Nest was unfair competition and demanded it be allowed only to take workers who paid in small amounts (the customers they didn’t want anyway) and that it be banned from accepting transfers of big company schemes (their juiciest customers). Sadly, the government caved in at the time. But yesterday pensions minister Steve Webb lifted the restrictions – albeit only from 2017, the date when the staging of auto-enrolment from large employers down to the smallest is finally completed. Nest keeps its costs low chiefly by investing members’ money in cheap tracker funds matching the performance of an index, rather than “actively managed” funds where star managers pocket millions of pounds individually – but where the evidence shows that almost none consistently beat the index. Also, it doesn’t have to shell out dividends to shareholders. Since Nest started it has attracted 1 million members. The private pension companies have begun cutting their charges, but few match Nest. From next April, they will be dragged (and they’re already screaming) by Steve Webb into a new regime whereby they will be banned from charging more than 0.75%. Charges matter. An individual earning £20,000 would save around £35,500 over their lifetime if they saved in a scheme with a 0.75% charge compared to a 1% charge – and much more if they are in Nest. Standard Life is already reported as having made provisions of £160m and Scottish Widows £100m to cope with the cap – but few will shed any tears for their shareholders. Nest isn’t perfect – as Tom McPhail of Hargreaves Lansdown points out, apart from its 0.3% annual charge, it imposes a 1.8% initial fee, which means it is more expensive than others if the member is, say, starting in their early 60s and isn’t going to contribute for long. And while it’s ultra-cheap for people accumulating their savings, it offers very little for the new world of “decumulation” – where you drawn down the money during your retirement. But even with the initial fee factored in, long-term savers will be facing charges that work out at 0.5% a year, or a third less than the private providers under the new cap. If you are self-employed, Nest is virtually a no-brainer. For many small and medium-sized employers, it stacks up extremely well against the private companies. It’s also an another antidote to the neoliberal wisdom that says private companies = good and public corporations = bad. East Coast, the train company, has cut journey times, carried more passengers and achieved higher customer satisfaction since coming under public ownership. Scottish Water, which unlike the providers south of the border is a publicly owned company, has over the last 10 years gone from charging more than its southern neighbours for water to £54 less in 2013-14. It doesn’t have private equity owners or infrastructure fund investors to keep happy. What Nest, East Coast, Scottish Water, John Lewis and Nationwide building society show is that publicly owned or mutually operated business models can more than effectively offer services that match or beat the private companies – although perhaps we won’t want to dwell too much on the experience of Co-operative Bank.

A Government owned / run pension fund has worked very well in Norway (albeit that is run as a sovereign wealth fund and the revenue comes from sources other than personal contributions). If it is run anywhere nears as competently in the UK, this is a good thing. Whether or not that is likely is another matter. The only difference is that Norway isn ' t about to go broke, it runs a surplus (6th largest in the world). If anyone thinks the government wont pilfer their money, they need their head looked at. Bonkers. Well the main difference is that they ' ve been doing it for years and timed it during the biggest growth in equities ever, thus becoming insanely rich (£100,00 per head of population or something like that) It helps that they still have lots of ongoing oil wealth from Statoil to pump into it where as the UK has been spaffing away its oil wealth and will soon lose what is left to the Scots. thus becoming insanely rich (£100,00 per head of population or something like that) =========== So what ' s that going to generate? Under their rules, not much. They have to preserve capital values. Hold on - how will the funds be managed? who are the fund managers? what is their track record?

"  From the article. NEST have got loads of fund managers. The whole pensions system is a complete mess. Look up  " zombie funds " , if you have a private pension you may be losing out big time! The whole pension system is a gigantic con trick.  When you pay in your pension, what happens is they buy shares from pensioners that are about to cash in.  Look at the accounts of any pension fund and you ' ll see that the amount of money coming in generally matches the amount they pay out - plus the interest paid on Gilts. So essentially all pension schemes - including NEST - operate exactly the same as if the government just taxed people a bit more (which is the same as compulsory pension saving), then paid a higher state pension - and didn ' t bother issuing any Gilts (thus leaving the money on deposit at the Bank of England).  If we did that, then there would be no cost to pensions at all, and all the people working in the pension industry skimming off their earnings from your earnings would have to get a proper job. Ummmm, yeah this isn ' t how all pension schemes work. I think you ' re talking about schemes which provide a set amount of benefits - the money coming into these schemes will (broadly) match the outgoings, because in these scheme employee contributions (i.e. the money you pay in) is towards the payment of all pensions, not just your own. So there ' s an overall pot of money which should pay all the pensions in payment, and all the pensions which will ever be paid out of the scheme.  The scheme has already set a benefit, it knows (roughly) how many pensioners there will be in any year and can predict investment returns (most pension schemes will have loads of different investment, not just gilts, unless it only has pensioners in) and how much money there is already in the collective  ' pot ' . The idea is to have enough to pay pensions not run a massive profit, so if there ' s not enough in the pot, extra contributions are required to make up the difference. So yes, the incomings should match the outgoings. It wouldn ' t work if they didn ' t. The majority of pension schemes these days operate nothing like taxation, you pay into your own pot, that pot is invested and your pension is based on the amount of money you personally (and your employer if you ' re lucky enough to have one who ' ll contribute) have put in. The pensions system does have its faults but it doesn ' t provide some level of security that once you ' ve earned a pension it can ' t be taken away (contrary to what a lot of people seem to think). Personally I ' d be wary of relying solely on a pension provided by that state, as you really are just paying for pensioners, and once you retire they really can decide to take it away if they decide to. PS you could always get a SIPP and invest the money yourself and pay any low investment fees you can find. When you pay in your pension, what happens is they buy shares from pensioners that are about to cash in. Great article, thanks. Need to go check what % my company pension is paying and check to see if I can move to this scheme. Well if you ' re in your company pension and they are paying in then dont Unfortunately whoever wrote teh article assumed that NEST was cheaper than current competiors in teh private sector - this is not teh case (for a start NEST takes 1.8% of every contribution that is made, before even consideirng amc ' s) Cheers, must admit I dont know much about this. I presume I cant set up a NEST pension scheme and get my company to pay into that (ie they will only pay into a scheme that they have picked). In which case you would be correct in saying it is not worth moving and instead hope that the company moves to the NEST scheme. how will the funds be managed? who are the fund managers? what is their track record? I ' d want to know before I hand over my fund. The article says: Nest keeps its costs low chiefly by investing members’ money in cheap tracker funds matching the performance of an index, rather than “actively managed” funds where star managers pocket millions of pounds individually – but where the evidence shows that almost none consistently beat the index. Feel free to put your trust in the  " star performers " . I wouldn ' t join you. They should open Nest to all individuals, not just company-wide transfers. I ' d join if I could at the moment, but I can ' t, because my company hasn ' t chosen to (been advised not to by... the pension advisers??) This is great news. I know a few people completely ripped of by the pension industry. I have long been mistrustful of any investment company that has to pay shareholders a profit and fund manager bonus ' s. Long term the sums don ' t add up. The sooner you can invest yourself in shares for a pension benefiting from tax relief the better. Currently the tax relief is a subsidy for a corrupt industry. It is why I have had to buy to let, I have no other pension option without engaging spivs. So how are your state pension contributions doing?  Oh dear - all gone. 100% in charges in effect. My state final pension is doing fine thanks, I will be getting 80% of my salary upon retirement, from day one. My state final pension is doing fine thanks. ======== No assets. 7,200 bn in liabilities rising at 640 bn a year. Compare to total taxes - all of them - at 600 bn a year. I think you are going to be sadly disappointed.  Consider this. a) Pay your 80% final salary and massively cut the state pension b) Cut your final salary pension and pay a little less to the masses in state pension.  I ' m afraid that you are going to lose that one. All because the state didn ' t invest, it spent. Should you hand your pension money to the government? With interest rates on our savings way below inflation, in effect we already are, mate! But equities, which most pension savers should be in, are returning around 8-9% pa at the moment so it ' s not all bad. Not if you measure it over 10 years they aren ' t. If you ' re banking on a continued 8-9% return - or say 6-7% real - then I think you ' re going to be sorely disappointed because equities are notoriously volatile and will at some stage dip back sharply. There must be a way to calculate this properly and integrate over the ups-and-downs of the stock market. Will think about this... The government fund might be run by people with more integrity than the people who work for the pension funds. But I don ' t suppose they will be any more competent. So why are they taking 100% of state pension contributions and giving that away?  3% in comparison makes you a saint. They don ' t give it away. Total nonsense. Yes they do.  It ' s unfunded. No assets. Zero.  The money has gone.  The money is no more.  Show us the assets if you don ' t believe me. [PS an IOU to yourself isn ' t an asset] Show us the liabilities. So we can compare the assets against the liabiltiies. I like low charges. I like competition. If it forces the industry to look seriously at their costs and reduce their charges and do a much better job on transfers, I ' ll be thrilled. But it ' s a bit rich to ignore the huge amount spent to get Nest off the ground - paid for by all taxpayers, and benefitting just those lucky enough to save with Nest.  I ' d prefer to see more competition, reduce barriers to entry, raise the limits on the maximum size of Pot follows Member, and use the threat of regulation to see proper STP. I think this is a better way to go for customers than price regulation and Government subsidised companies. I expect Steve Webb will be kicked out by 2017 and replaced by an big fund funded stooge who will stop this public benefitting nonsense. Great article, I am a no brainer self employed type. I still have money in Equitable Life from a company pension!
