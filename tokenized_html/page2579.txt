bonzer alpha omega twin fin board locker i got this bonzer alpha omega twin shaped by none other than malcolm campbell himself because there s no volume charts and not much press i wasn t sure how the board was going to come out i love my fcd boards so i had the board glassed there with the resin tint the board looks and feels absolutely amazing super deep bottom concaves and cool outline a few things the dims are 6 1 20 1/4 2 5/8 one thing this board is thick compared to the regular shortboards and boards i ve been riding this thing really carries the volume out to the rails it probably has 36-37l at least malcolm and fcd recommended the tt fins which is what i ve been using on it session review i ve only ridden it a few times and each time i wished i would have gotten a 5 10 or something based on its outline and volume i ll keep updating this section when i get a good session on it your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name email website notify me of new comments via email notify me of new posts via email view full site create a free website or blog at wordpress.com
