Healing Palm Spa - Quezon City, Philippines - Massage Service, Health Spa | Facebook Tatay’s first 1 hour swedish massage for a very long time, his last massage is when he was still single  😁  Nanay’s first EVER massage, foot reflex and back massage, she’s very conservative  😁  My every month 1 hour swedish massage.  My senior parents (both 72yo) enjoyed their massages. MASARAP DAW NAMAN TALAGA.  From the front desk and masseuses they are all nice, courteous, and accommodating.  The location is along Otis.
