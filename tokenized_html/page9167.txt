tea ceremony koto was a wonderful experience and i highly recommend it to those visiting japan for one thing it is right across the street from kinkakuji the gold pavilion in kyoto so coupling these two things together for a morning or afternoon is easy convenient and really gives you a nice rounded experience kinkakuji is a huge magnet for tourists and can easily be overrun balancing that with the serene quiet atmosphere of koto is refreshing br rie who leads the tea ceremony is a tea master i have been fortunate enough to see a few tea ceremonies in my time in japan i lived there for 3 years and i can safely say that the experience with rie was the best because her english is so good she was able to explain in great detail the meaning of the rituals to my wife who does not speak japanese we opted for the solo tea ceremony again it was nice to get away from the madness of the 'shrine and temple tourist rush in kyoto where rie explains not only the meaning of the rituals but also what we as participants should do after the explanation she performs the ceremony for real it was such a special experience and one that we will treasure forever br plus we got to do it in kimonos which was awesome it was a fantastic photo op overall this was one of the highlights of our trip and i recommend it to anyone looking to have a wonderful unique experience in japan thank you very much for your graceful and detail message i really appreciate it i wish you both happiness forever p report response as inappropriate thank you we appreciate your input this response is the

our zen day the tea ceremony is a very important element of the zen culture and as such it made perfect sense to attend one between visiting daitoku-ji and ryoan-ji the experience we lived was exactly what we were looking for we were nicely introduced to the basics of tea ceremony and we got involved into it without asking too much from our side the teacher was very kind spoke very good english answered all our questions and made a very good tea if you have an open mind and are ready to enlarge it even further this experience is for you thank you so much for your message i 'm glad to hear that you liked matcha tea please enjoy making powered green tea at home too. br and i hope you remember the experience in koto sometimes this site uses cookies to improve your experience to enhance
