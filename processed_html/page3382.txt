Oh, when you smile at me and I can notice every time you speak. My bed's too big for just me and when you turn your eyes,  I promise I won't care. Oh baby baby baby babe Oh baby baby baby please My head sinks to my knees. Oh baby baby don't you know I think about you nightly? My bed's too big for just me and when you turn your eyes,  I promise I won't care. Oh baby baby baby babe I think about you nightly I think about you nightly Oh baby baby baby baby Oh baby baby baby babe. When I look in your eyes I tend to lose my thoughts Don't forget your stare Or what was that you said? Would you let me know? 'Cause I can't read your mind But can you tell I can't even explain Oh baby baby baby babe I think about you nightly I think about you nightly Oh baby baby baby I think about you nightly Oh baby I can't even explain  How long am I supposed to wait? I think about you nightly Oh can you tell I'm losin' sleep? Oh baby, what am I supposed to do? It's hard to stay cool. Oh when you smile at me and I can notice every time you speak.
