//www.learningsharepoint.com/2010/08/21/net-4-with-sharepoint-foundation-2010/ good luck gary hi gary thnaks for your quick response based on the couple of forums in the same series i performed few actions br i have tried to use framework removal tools and try to remove 4.0 framework and it succeeded but when i restart that same removal tool i found that framework 4.0 in that list of dropdown along with framework 1.0 and 2.0 i tried again and again but each time it succeeded and still keep that in dropdown list moreover i tried to check the windir \microsoft.net\framework\ directory where i found 3.0 and 3.5 folders 1.0 and 2.0 is obvious but not havign 4.0 folder there.. p one thing i notice here from the log file generated from this tool is not adding product '.net framework 3.5 because the os condition does not match was wrote in that file same for 3.0 as well so here i am confused then after when i tried to install 3.5 from the setup provided my microsoft it started to extract the files from setup but did not performed any operation then-after do n't know what is wrong and why no further message or error or success i tried couple of way like command line silent mode extract the file in specific location and try to install but i am not getting any error same time installation is not getting started. p request you to please help me out in removing framework 4 and clean installation of 3.5 hi brijesh i guess you can use both if you are using visual studio 2010 to build any solution then while chosing the framework you should choose 3.5 rather than 4.0 thanks

me sad to see how many people out there are struggling because ms ca n't address a very real is prevailent issue and that is the fact that sharepoint 2010 will be installed on 64-bit machines that also have .net 4.0 i 've spent days of my life fighting sharepoint and tfs installs because of how many problems arise from this combination and the lack of support from ms your approach may have worked for any number of reasons but below is likely all you needed and if you too are running sharepoint 2010 on a server with .net 4.0 and a 64bit x86 version of server this is the key to fixing all sorts of tfs and sharepoint related problems make sure that all iis apppools related to tfs and sharepoint natively maybe not 3rd party ones but those required just to properly access central admin and a brand new web application in sharepoint are set using apppool advanced settings to enable 32-bit applications false and .net framework is 4.0 preferably 2.0 if you want to save yourself as much trouble as possible that 's it the real issue is that ms has failed to recognize when this combination of variables have come together and ensure those are set it seems that the defaults are .net 4.0 and 32-bit apppools are enabled that breaks all sorts of fundamental dependencies and getting through all the logs and stack traces to dig to the very bottom of the cause can literally take days i.t
