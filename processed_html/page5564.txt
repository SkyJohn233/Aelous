The actress, producer, New York Times’ bestselling author, and inspirational speaker, Candace Cameron Bure, is both outspoken and passionate about her family and her faith. Known to millions worldwide for her role as D. J. Tanner on the iconic family sitcom “Full House,” Candace continues to flourish in the entertainment industry as a role model for women of all ages. gettyimages With an acting career that started at the age of five, Candace grew up in show business alongside her brother, Kirk Cameron, and has appeared in countless national television commercials, prime-time hits, made for TV movies and feature films. Candace has starred in multiple made-for-television movies for Hallmark Channel and Up TV, including “Puppy Love,” “Moonlight  &  Mistletoe,” “Finding Normal”, Emmy-nominated “The Heart of Christmas,” and “Let It Snow.” “Let It Snow” ranks as the #2 all-time, most-viewed original release for the Hallmark Network. gettyimages Her most recent movie, “Christmas Under Wraps,” broke historic records, becoming Hallmark’s most-watched telecast ever and cable’s second most-watched original movie of 2014. It is a beautiful thing her daughter is following in her footsteps. Having starred in multiple Hallmark Christmas movies in the past, Candace is welcoming her daughter to the small screen. The mother-daughter duo will be starring in "Switched for Christmas," which will premiere on the network on November 26, 2017. Candace spoke about what it was like working with her daughter, Natasha Bure. She said: gettyimages Candace also said in an interview with People: Talent really runs in the family. Natasha is the 16-year-old daughter of actress Candace Bure and Valeri Bure (former NHL player) budding singer/songwriter and YouTuber. She has always loved being in front of the camera. It started when she began modeling and acting in commercials. She continued to pursue musical theater in school, knowing she aspired to be in the entertainment industry. gettyimages Natasha also began playing tennis at an early age and is now a varsity player at her high school. On weekends, she loves hanging out with her family at hockey games and leads worship at her church. With over 115,000 followers on Instagram and 22,000 subscribers on YouTube, Natasha is beginning to make her own name for herself. She currently lives in Los Angeles with her parents, two brothers Lev and Maks, and their puppy, Boris. Her favorite things to do include: singing, tennis, dancing, making YouTube videos, baking/cooking, shopping, leading worship, youth group events, going to the beach, doing makeup, hanging out with friends, spending time with family. Hmm!  She's no doubt going to be a Hollywood sweetheart. gettyimages According to a Hallmark's description of "Switched For Christmas," the story follows the journey of a set of estranged twin sisters (both played by Candace), who  "get together for an obligatory pre-Christmas lunch, a year after their mother died." "Both women are unhappy and frustrated with their own lives. Though not close, each is envious of the other’s life."  As a result, the two swap lives until the day of Christmas. Naturally, this leads to the sisters finding the true appreciation of their own lives. gettyimages It is not clear which role Natasha played in the movie. But we are so eager to watch her alongside her mother because Natasha, who wowed her judges at the Voice audition recently, is sure a bunch of talents. So, get your popcorn ready, because this is one Christmas movie we are all excited and looking forward to. And when you get a chance to watch it, let us know what you think about it.
