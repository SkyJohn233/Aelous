My academic classes are challenging.  I am a Theater major and deeply love the process based classes in addition to performances.  Before Walnut Hill, I was really involved with my local theater but it was only about performance.  Here we are deeply invested in the art form.  The people here are wonderful and supportive and I feel as though I can be myself here. Read  65 Reviews Junior : &# xA0; I am a soprano majoring in classical voice here at the Academy, and it is by far the most incredible place I have ever been and the best decision I have ever made. I have had numerous opportunities here that I would not have had back home; participating in opera scenes, studying with professional instructors, taking masterclasses from world-renowned singers, taking rigorous academic courses and music theory classes, learning to play the organ, participating in student government, quiz bowl, and environmental committees, and of course, learning about art with like-minded peers. In addition, the location is absolutely beautiful and inspiring on its own. There are so many opportunities for students to bond and find enjoyment in the local Traverse City area and it is all safe. The voice program here by far rises above the rest of the art schools in the country. I say with confidence that I feel much more prepared for college/conservatory and the career ahead of me. Sound the call! Read  202 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Studying at LACHSA for nearly 4 years, I became more receptive to abstract and conceptual ideas. I learned more about art history, new materials such as oil painting and figure drawing! LACHSA also provided seasonal exhibiting opportunities(Winter and Spring Show) for students to show their work produced in class. Overall, an amazing art education and experience! Read  166 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; DASH provides us with a supportive and welcoming environment that beams with creative energy, unlike any other. Its given me so many opportunities, like a 3 week all expense paid trip to NYC for a pre college program, and the chance to bond with people who are passionate about the same artistic field. I ' ve had a wonderful experience at DASH, but I do feel the need to caution that it is definitely a huge commitment. DASH requires long hours of work, a genuine  passion for art, and an understanding that you may sacrifice your academics for art (ex. no advanced math classes are taught after AP Calculus AB, physics and AP Environmental Science are not offered and have to be taken online). The school prepares you to pursue art in college, but I ' m not sure if it prepares you well enough for an academic college career, hence the sacrifice. Despite this, there is no other school I would rather go to! Read  263 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; The Chicago Academy for the Arts has literally changed my entire life. I ' m a senior currently enrolled in the media arts animation department and after coming to this school I not only feel prepared for college but also for a serious career in the animation industry. The school gives what you need to be successful with freedom to grow into yourself. There is no other class, program, or school like it. DON ' T GET ME STARTED ON THE STAFF. Every single teacher I ' ve had has cared about each individuals students growth and success. It took me a whole year to write a decent paper and once I wrote one my English teacher pulled me aside after class and PERSONALLY expressed to me how impressed he was at how much I had grown from my last paper. Arts teachers are just as great, in media arts specifically we have personal mid  &  end of year reviews where our teachers come together and tell you where you need to improve  &  what you ' re doing right Since coming here my art has GREATLY improved. Read  38 Reviews Alum : &# xA0; Your time at A & D will be short once you look back on it. The school is absolutely amazing at providing students with resources and material, if only the students took advantage of the opportunities. In general, the school ' s academics are alright.  However, there are some excellent teachers at the school, that go beyond just teaching in the classroom.  All the art teachers are brilliant, and will teach you much about your major. Many of them either work in the field, taught the course at a college level, or both. I would say the clubs are limited, and the sports isn ' t a big aspect.  There are both good and bad kids in this school, like any other. It ' s become a bit more diverse in recent years, and have been preparing kids for college better. Really, the only downside is how the administration deals with the bathroom situation in the school. Read  299 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Most of my experience here has been wonderful. There have been a couple of teachers here and there that weren ' t that good at all but the majority are amazing. I couldn ' t help but notice how invested the teachers are in the students success and have even developed some amazing bonds with some of my teachers. For an arts school, the academics are pretty good and of course the different art strands are also amazing. It ' s a very free and independent environment but the faculty members give help if you seek it out (counselling, recommendations, scholarship opportunities, tutoring, etc...) which I think is perfect when trying to get highschoolers to get used to a college environment. My only problem is that certain higher up administrators have been slacking and don ' t treat every strand with the same respect which is totally unfair but other than that, everything here is pretty nice. Read  285 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; Amazing school for the arts. It isn ' t a typical high school. If you ' re looking for Friday Night Football and pep assemblies, this might not be the place for you. But if you ' re looking for a very supportive, creative environment that appreciates diversity, this is it. And some people think because it ' s an arts school it doesn ' t have good academics. It does! My coursework is challenging and doesn ' t all revolve around my cluster (I ' m music.) I ' ve taken lots of AP classes and think I ' m set up to do well in college. Read  444 Reviews Parent : &# xA0; We have two children in the elementary school and could not be more pleased!  There is nothing about the school we don ' t like.  From the academics, to the arts, to the community, Oakwood takes great pride and care in making sure that everyone ' s needs are being met.  We are incredibly excited for our children to attend the secondary school, as it offers both competitive academics with incredible arts and STEAM programs.  With the new athletic director, we are excited to see what advances are made in that arena as well.  We cannot recommend Oakwood highly enough. Read  31 Reviews Alum : &# xA0; What I liked about New Roads School while enrolled was pretty much everything! This school takes a holistic approach to preparing its students for the rigors of a higher education as well as making a difference in society. The faculty, staff, and administrators, who truly became our friends and mentors, created a one-of-kind learning environment  where I felt challenged, motivated, and encouraged to do my best. The enrichment trips I got to go on each year I attended the upper school, regardless of me and my family &# x2019;s  financial need, have had such positive effects on me &# x2014;I still remember those trips fondly to this day. I could go on and on about New Roads School. Read  106 Reviews Alum : &# xA0; At Crossroads School, students thrive as learners, artists, and people. Rigorous coursework, paired with high level discussions of society ' s major problems, push students to become active global citizens dedicated to making a change in the world. The teachers '  commitment to the students is unparalleled; the learning style often asks students to connect curriculum and their own lives, providing for deep personal and intellectual refection. The campus is vibrant and lively: at lunchtime, some students play music and dance on tables while others can be found rehearsing student theatre, playing in the annual ping pong tournament, engaged in one of the school ' s 30+ community service and social justice clubs, and more. Crossroads is a place where students can explore themselves and their passions in a safe, warm environment, all while applying their newfound knowledge to real world problems. Crossroads students prove that even high schoolers can make a difference! Read  44 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; More than just a school: above all, a home. Fourteen floors of chaotically creative people, students, teachers and faculty alike. From the age of six I was taught to constantly question and challenge everything, that play rehearsals were more important than that physics test. I have learned to self motivate without competing with classmates and to treat every essay I write with the respect and eloquence of a novel. I have made puppets, written a twenty-page paper on the history of martial arts, and hypothesized whether sweet flavors are more commonly synesthetically assigned to major chords. Keep in mind that this environment in addition to being incredibly fruitful both creatively and academically, it can be perceived as a rose-colored, six-foot thick bubble, protecting its students from harsh realities beyond its walls. In my last year, I have come to see Saint Ann ' s for all of its flaws and strengths. Thank you! Read  33 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; The High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, also known as HSPVA, is best known for its involvement in arts in general. But much more lies beneath this school &# x2019;s surface. The school &# x2019;s academics are amazing, trumping many other schools year after year. Their main goal is to get students into the great colleges they want to. The student community is very diverse and welcoming, and there is a tremendous amount of culture within the walls of the old school. There are over forty clubs- which is quite a lot considering the school &# x2019;s roughly 700 students. More clubs are added and replaced every year- if you don &# x2019;t see anything you like one year, wait until the next one. Or, better yet, start your own! I absolutely love this school! It ' s a huge community, the teachers and the administration R all extremely student-friendly. That actually care about us! The academics is hard, but teachers really want to help you. Read  239 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; My main concerns of the school is the building. We ' ve had multiple flooding due to poor piping that ' s more than 30 years old. The heating and cooling systems in the building are also not the best. The room temperatures of each room can differ drastically. My gov class is usually pretty cold that I need to wear a thick sweater, while my English class is where I  sweat off my calories from the school breakfast. In addition, school lunch really isn ' t the best. The portions of the lunch given is not equal. One kid getting chicken nuggets, fries and greens is not equal to another child being given only 3 chicken nuggets due to a short of supplies. We have escalators that barely work. Lastly, I am against smoking in the bathrooms. There have been 2 occasions where I personally smelt the gross fumes of the smoke and I ' ve witnessed many times vaping in the bathrooms. Read  993 Reviews Alum : &# xA0; I went to CSW back in the 1970 ' s ,my mother ' s idea , because I was on the verge of dropping out of school. I just wanted to be an artist, and saw no reason to go any farther,but after a year at CSW I loved the teachers and students, and many remained lifetime friends.I was able to direct my own course and went on to college, and became a professional artist. Since then I ' ve travelled the world,exhibited over 100 times ,many times in Europe,China,Canada, the USA, and Korea.The teachers were excellent! Read  55 Reviews Parent : &# xA0; Professional Children ' s School is a unique academic and cultural institution in New York City. For more than 100 years, PCS has been providing pre-professional and professional dancers, musicians, actors, athletes, artists, and entrepreneurs the opportunity to receive a challenging and engaging college preparatory academic education with flexible scheduling within a supportive community.  At Professional Children ' s School, students do not need to choose between a great education and their dreams. Read  5 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; My decision going to OCSA ended up being the best decision of my life. I am in the classical voice conservatory and have gotten so many opportunities here. I have won many vocal competitions, gotten to do master classes with famous opera stars like Suzanna Guzman, and have strengthened my music theory skills. I also get to work with kids that have the same passion and dedication that I do. This school has many different people that have different beliefs and cultures. OCSA has always dedicated a week or a day to each of these things. We have gay pride day every year, we have culture week, and even halloween is a blast with everyone in their over the top costumes! I have been lucky enough to have the best of both worlds, opera and musical theatre. I am also taking a dance class as part of my academic school day at OCSA. The dance teachers are phenomenal. some of them have even made it in the professional world. My dance training has definitely improved since I have been at OCSA. Read  483 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; I love ESLA! I &# x2019;ve gone since 6th grade and I &# x2019;m so happy I stayed all through high school. My teachers are amazing, the food is restaurant quality, the country feels like family, and the college counciling here is unlike any other school! ESLA not only provides a fantastic education but really shapes its students into good people. Read  17 Reviews Alum : &# xA0; I had a wonderful experience with the Governor &# x2019;s School! I was a student for one summer and three years and learned so much about myself as an artist, a scholar, and an independent individual. The residential element is an element that sets this school above the rest by bringing artist from all over SC together to truly embrace their creativity without a cent in tuition! For me, it was a hard adjustment as a sophomore to move into a dorm an hour and a half away from home after just turning 15, but my peers and the staff helped with this transition and made my time at Governor &# x2019;s School a phenomenal experience! Read  71 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; I came in 9th grade, and after a few months I found my group! The theatre department is fantastic. The faculty and my teachers have been immensely supportive and hands on with an issue I ' ve been having for years, with a really extraordinary focus on my well-being, compared to maybe how other schools would handle it. When I first got to Wildwood, I was surprised by the lack of cliques and hierarchy found in other schools, including my previous one. Though not perfect, I ' m grateful that to go here, I think it ' s the best fit for me. Read  36 Reviews Junior : &# xA0; I have throughly enjoyed my experience at Oakland School for the Arts. The faculty is extremely friendly and outgoing, and the arts programs are incredible I have been at this school since 6th grade, and I would highly reccomend it to any prospective sstudents. In general college prep is pretty ok. If you are looking to pursue your art as a career (or at least in college) you will be well set. However, if you are looking to go into academic areas of study, it may be a little bit harder due to the smaller number of electives. Nevertheless, OSA is a really great school, and the community is amazing! A lot of people are super friendly, and it is easy to make friends and create support systems. The academic support and wellness counseling/therapy resources are also a big plus, and if you end up here, expect to have help whenever it is needed. I hope this helps to influence your decisions. Trust me, OSA is not an opportunity you want to miss out on. Hope to see you on campus! Read  126 Reviews Sophomore : &# xA0; Excellent with Great Teachers! It needs more improvement regarding clubs and extracurricular, otherwise it is amazing. Read  43 Reviews Junior : &# xA0; This school holds so many memories in its walls, and I am so happy to have gotten accepted there! I am in my junior year currently, and am proud to have gotten to spend spend freshman and sophomore year there, and soon senior year as well. This school is so unique and filled with passionate, kind, and diverse students. Our community here is strong, and each day brings something new. This school doesn &# x2019;t just provide you with enough knowledge to make it to college, if one cares about it enough to continue on, it provides you with opportunity to become a better person as a whole, and the staff and fellow students are always ready to help and support one another. Read  155 Reviews Senior : &# xA0; After attending Perpich for one year I think that the best part of it the teacher student bond. The teachers at this school create an enviromrnt that is easy for all types of students to learn, they cater to everyone &# x2019;s needs more than any other school I &# x2019;ve been at. Another nice feature of Perpich is the amount of materials that you have access to. If you were living on your own and paying for your own art supplies you would be paying thousands of dollars for the amount of technology and materials that are available at this school. Making these materials free to their student body has helped so many kickoff their career in arts. Every week this school brings in speakers that have usually graduated from Perpich that have succeeded and it provides inspiration every week to keep learning and to keep pursuing our individual art areas. Read  132 Reviews Parent : &# xA0; I have 2 children currently attending Hillbrook.  They look forward to going to school each day and are both thriving academically.   There is an emphasis on project-based, interdisciplinary learning, as well as collaboration -  all taught in an environment that encourages independent thinking.  This type of schooling may look different than traditional models, but the proof that it has had an impact on my children is in their enthusiasm for learning and love they have for their school.   I have no doubt that the lessons they learn at Hillbrook are laying the foundation for success in high school, college and beyond. Read  7 Reviews Parent : &# xA0; We are so happy that our children have had the privilege of attending Legacy Christian Academy (LCA) and have been an LCA family for nine years now. Legacy Christian Academy has caring teachers, a purposeful administration team, and the best science/math programs in the area. We believe in higher education and setting a strong foundation is crucial to succeeding in life. Thus, we wanted to give our children the best education possible while giving them the core values needed, and we have found that at LCA. We have 3 boys who are currently in 10th, 8th, and 5th grades, all of whom have experienced LCA. Our oldest two boys have experienced the middle school program and are thriving!  The Middle School Program at Legacy has built a strong foundation for our children. Our family has experienced the most wonderful education at Legacy Christian Academy and we love it! &# x201D;  Saber (M.D.) and Fatin (Pharm.D.)
