have for the next generation of dancers kim gingras we all know that talent and looks play a big part in this industry it can be very hard to be judged on your appearance on what you chose to wear on the decisions you made when it came time to freestyle etc so you need thick skin you can t let it get to you and take it too personal that will eat you alive you have to expect doors to close and you have to believe other doors will open my best advice is to stay positive to always carry yourself with the best possible energy that goes a long way visualization is something i believe in as well envision yourself doing what you would like to do let yourself dream big let those vibrations out into the universe and of course always work hard and work on getting better there is no better project
