Question re: Croissants in the 2nd Arrondissement! - Paris Forum - TripAdvisor Hi there We are renting an apartment on rue Monsigny in 2nd arr. and I was wondering if anyone could recommend a good boulangerie in the area that makes its own croissants. Gordon Ramsay featured one (I can ' t remember which area it was in) on one of his recent programmes (the F Word on Channel 4, I think), but I didn ' t take note of the name.  Also, any recommendations for local restaurants, bistros, cafes, bars etc where we could get breakfast or a late night drink would be appreciated!! Thank you. Rue Montrorgueil (sp?) is the market street in the 2nd, lots of great bakeries and places to eat. Any residential neighborhood has 6 or 7 boulangeries within a few blocks. Part of the fun is testing them until you find the perfect item. You are less than 5 minutes walk from  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-23911551', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Place du Marche Saint Honore  where there is a good selection of restaurants including l ' Absinthe which I have eaten in and enjoyed. Just off the  Rue Saint Honore  end of the Place is an old wine bar called  Le Rubis  - nothing fancy about this place but you ' ll get some simple, hearty food and quality wines at very affordable prices for the neighbourhood. …wordpress.com/2009/… Rgds, Liam Three suggestions: Stohrer, 51,  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-23915481', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); rue Montorgueil , 75002  Paris ; Au Panetier, 10, place des Petits Pères, 75002;  Eric Kayser, 16, rue des Petits Carreaux, 75002 Paris. http://www.chocoparis.com Totally agree with all the previous recommendations. I ' ll just add two that are only a couple of minutes '  walk from you: 1) Boulangerie de la Fontaine at 15 rue Gaillon -- their croissants and pain au chocolat are excellent and they have tiny tables with bar stools for breakfast or light lunch (good quiches) Only open Mon-Friday. 2) Boulangerie F2M at 42 r Petits Champs-- their  ' baguette normale '  is outstanding (my daily loaf). They also have tables for bfast, but I haven ' t tried their pastries. It ' s right outside the  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-23916935', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Passage Choiseul  which I ' m sure you ' ll be strolling through since it ' s right in the neighborhood. Open Mon-Sat. Oh, and don ' t forget the Saturday morning market on Place  du Marche St Honore --great roast chickens. Enjoy the area! Thank you all so very much!! There ' s an excellent creperie called  (ta  & &  ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-24015817', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression'); Le Cap Breton  at 12, Rue Monsigny. -:- Message from TripAdvisor staff -:- This post has been removed at the author's request.
