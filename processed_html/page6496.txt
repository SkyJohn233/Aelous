[SOLVED] how to get product features access in controller - Core developers - PrestaShop Forums Forgot your password? By  SonoguN ,   October 15, 2013  in  Core developers Hi   I am looking for a way to access product features from a custom module controller. Can anyone offer some guidance on which function I need to use, or how to go about doing this?   Thanks, Etienne $product = new Product(2); $product_features = $product- > getfeatures();   then you will have features in product $product_features Awesome, thanks I will try this  don't forget to confirm if everything will work as you expect  Hi Vekia, I ended up using the following to get an array of features...   $frontfeatures = Product::getFrontFeaturesStatic($this- > context- > language- > id, $thisProductid);   Thanks for your help  Just wondering is there a comprehensive list of functions and explanations on how to use them? Or do we need to dig around in the controllers to find this out? Thanks i don't know any list of functions, i'm developing modules, apps etc. and usually you can easily browse available functions in classes, Ok cool, thanks! that''s what I usually do now just thought there may be a wiki or something.. Cheers thank you, im going to mark this thread as [solved]   with regards Milos $product = new Product(2); $product_features = $product- > getfeatures();   then you will have features in product $product_features   I want to access this info in a module but I use Prestashop1.6 : did this code evolve ? I cannot make it work ... You can post now and register later.If you have an account,  sign in now  to post with your account.
