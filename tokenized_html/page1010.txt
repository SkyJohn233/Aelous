host these jsp pages on a different server than the bigbluebutton server something that wasn t possible to do with the grails bbb-web application if you look at the source for demo3.jsp you ll see a

/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/ bigbluebutton/demo/ and change them to define your own meetings with passwords you ll need a java servlet container to run these pages the api demo3.jsp also uses the logouturl so that you can control where users are redirected after they logout from the bigbluebutton client if anyone out there is a php wiz we re looking for a volunteer to convert the jsp api demo pages into their php equivalents for release in 0.64 regards .. fred jeremy i ve got a question for you i ve made php scripts but i ran into a security issue using the ajax call this is the same with any other dev language we will create in future i tested my php demo api file on a different domain like xxx.com while bbb runs on a vm 192.168.x.x and when i call ismeetingrunning using ajax i ve cross domain security issues we have different solutions to fix this nginx throught fastcgi to process thoses php files not good to me.many users would like to have their api controller on another domain/server handling options request access-control-request header seems good to me but only recent browser like firefox 3.x and ie8 can do that options request with headers access-control-request-method get access-control-request- headers x-requested-with but i don t know how to make the groovy apps api to handle options request so it can send back the access-control-allow-origin header any idea create an internal gateway using a php proxy script which request to tomcat server internally and the ajax request this php proxy script located on the same domain crossbrowser and fully working but lame ^^ for the others any other idea what do you think is best thanks djp is it an option to have the php code running on the server call ismeetingrunning directly the browser can in turn call the php code to get the return result from ismeetingrunning from the bigbluebutton server regards fred on feb 17 7:22 am djp d architectes.org wrote hi there

even if it consume more ressources and create more possible point of failure since it s not direct a while after writing my previous post i thought too this was the best solution this means each new api languages will have to create this proxy script compared to the jsp examples i ll finish the php api example with that php proxy script commit and i ll do the python api script django plone oh and where can i commit thoses php files on the svn any prefered destination folder thanks for your thought djp that s great you can check them at /trunk/bbb-api-examples/php at some point we ll move of the jsp examples into /trunk/bbb-api-examples/jsp and follow the same format for others regards fred on feb 17 8:13 am djp d architectes.org wrote hi fred yep that was my third solution a php proxy
