refinancing or selling your pv assets 3e 22-04-2015 the european market has been a leader in the development of pv assets since the beginning of the 21st century nowadays gigawatts of capacity are being operated for several years all around europe and many players are looking now into financial optimization of their business by either refinancing the assets or selling them showing the operating performance of your pv asset or portfolio is a critical aspect when assessing the relevancy of financial optimization when looking at the different renewable energy technologies pv might be considered as the most decentralized one as it is characterized by portfolios of many relatively small plants located in a large geographical area and based on different components and equipment additionally standards have not been developed and implemented by taking into account the way to calculate operating performance re-financing is mainly interesting when risks and thus uncertainties can be reduced due to the heterogeneity specific to pv it can lead to some misleading ideas concerning the operational performance of a portfolio at 3e we have been developing our knowledge for years now regarding operating behavior of pv plants and the best way to measure it when looking at a portfolio of plants we always start with an in-depth analysis of how irradiation and yield are measured in most cases we see that porftolio s are not uniform leading to inaccurate performance estimations which results into erroneous p50/p90 values used in models evaluating the actual behavior of the assets despite this lack of uniformity 3e has the capability of assessing the real performance of portfolio s thanks to its inhouse knowledge and tools in the case where inappropriate irradiation measuring equipment is used see table below showing the theoretical accuracy of different pyranometer classes we select data from carefully calibrated satellite sources see chart below comparing satellite data sources when performing an assessment for a plant operating for more than 1 year this calibration gives us results close to the uncertainties of the best in class onsite installed pyranometers knowing that most of the sites are not equipped with the best in class pyranometer or that these devices are not always maintained appropriately 3e s approach has real added value next to the review of meteorological considerations defining the real yield produced by a plant and the availability and reliability of the plant or the grid is also an exercise which requires experience based knowledge and methodology previous experience has shown that assessing the performance of plants based on operating data sometimes lead to deviation of more than 5 when compared to initial provided reports such differences are considerable as this is the order of magnitude between an over-performing and an average portfolio s or between average and poor performing if you consider re-financing your portfolio or acquiring an operating portfolio it is thus recommended to have first a critical look at the numbers you present or to those that are presented to you by appointing a credible and experienced independent technical advisor your name required your email required subject your message hidden hidden-814 post_title
