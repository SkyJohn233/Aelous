years ago by hudrty i brought this up in this subreddit before but mountains are so amazing in real life just look at glacier national park on google i see the epic mountains in the background in terraria but i wonder what a new biome on the surface could do to really change things imagine the possibilities -unique enemies like lizards or bears for fur pelts or snakeskin apparel -cave systems made from abandoned mines or creatures -randomly generated monasteries at the peaks -a new npc who sells mounts wouldn t riding a mountain goat be radical -new accessories and paintings it d be reminiscent of tibetan culture for reference -more emphasis on mud and clay building materials to make those colorful palaces -fog and cloud cover because of the altitude and i know increasing the height might be too big of a change but i feel there should be more emphasis on combat adventures and builds above the surface more there s so much to explore down below and all the way to hell why not even the odds and go up as well let s have a discussion could it work post a comment – notjustinbailey 8 points 9 points 10 points 4 years ago 5 children there was a to forum thread about this each world would randomly choose between 2 oceans 1 ocean 1 mountain or 2 mountains they would make the world feel like it s not just an island and it would be a nice alternative to the boring water – merchando 2 points 3 points 4 points 4 years ago 0 children awesome i hope this gets implemented – showmeyourcat 2 points 3 points 4 points 4 years ago 2 children two mountains well and how are you going to kill the ol duke fishron edit well time for a new account i seam to got attention from some pissy downvoter stalkers edit2 thank you guys – notjustinbailey 2 points 3 points 4 points 4 years ago 1 child okay maybe not two mountains but technically you can just say then how are you going to kill the eater of worlds if you get a crimson world but then you d have to make it 2 mountains or 2 oceans and have a new boss for the mountains so maybe 1 and 1 – showmeyourcat 2 points 3 points 4 points 4 years ago 0 children eater of worlds you could bring corrupted stuff from another world but you can t bring a whole beach think about servers single player this is no problem you just load another world i think one beach and one mountain is the way to go – hudrty s 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago 0 children i like that idea – unclephister 7 points 8 points 9 points 4 years ago 1 child up vote solely because you used radical good to know others are keeping that word alive also i like the idea could be fun stay rad – hudrty s 1 point 2 points 3 points 4 years ago 0 children rad dad – gnomesurf 24 points 25 points 26 points 4 years ago 6 children the world height would have to be i don t know tripled unless they are incredibly short mountains no – deleted 6 points 7 points 8 points 4 years ago 0 children yea i ve had hills that reach near flying islands and there is like a post on here a week where someone is on a hill right under a flying island – weepingskull 2 points 3 points 4 points 4 years ago 3 children yeah world hight needs to be increased because ive hade a large world where the spawn was just under harpy spawning i moved up a very small hill and was attacked i checked and that was the way the whole world generated.. – deleted 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago 2 children that leaves you pretty vulnerable to wyvern attacks huh – hudrty s 1 point 2 points 3 points 4 years ago 1 child all the more reason to be scared of those mountains – deleted 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago 0 children hear hear first time i encountered one of those sky snakes i was torn to pieces in no time no sane man should ever venture anywhere near wyvern territory – hudrty s 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago 0 children it s not like increasing the height would be a problem – metalgearray477 4 points 5 points 6 points 4 years ago 0 children this idea is a good idea – agentlym 4 points 5 points 6 points 4 years ago 1 child i love this idea if it were a separate biome we wouldn t have to worry about harpies they could be coded out – hudrty s 1 point 2 points 3 points 4 years ago 0 children or just bump the world height – sniffyskirt 2 points 3 points 4 points 4 years ago 0 children i wish the world was circular so that when you go to the end it takes you to the beginning of the other side – dmkrodan 1 point 2 points 3 points 4 years ago 0 children goblin caves would be interesting and world friendly too – redismafia 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago 3 children it would be really tedious to walk past a mountain while heading to the ocean tho forcing you to mine a huge tunnel early in the game – tzheihoh 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago 1 child what if worldgen already included tunnels – hudrty s 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago 0 children yeah like mineshafts – hudrty s 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago 0 children even now with the crimson/corruption tall cliffs and lakes getting around early game is difficult anyway – wumperd 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago 1 child great idea i would love something like that and as you said there are some nice options for world generation but the height of the world would have to be at least tripled unless we want small mountains maybe do something with the harpies they would be too annoying to always spawn everywhere but harpy nest as a mini biome would be awesome – hudrty s 0 points 1 point 2 points 4 years ago 0 children i was thinking since the surface can actually go pretty far down maybe there doesn t have to be that much of a sky expansion posts are automatically archived after 6 months we are unable to post your link or media unless you can verify
