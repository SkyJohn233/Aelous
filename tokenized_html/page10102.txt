aura-knight 23:20 20 december 2008 utc i was reading the nintendo power stadium 2 guild and in the back it said eeveelution. pokéboy93 05:19 23 july 2009 utc though unlike their evolutionary cousins they were not available early on in pokémon diamond and pearl they are in fact available early on in pokémon platinum even before the player has gotten the third badge that 's halfway correct you can get leafeon before the third badge but not glaceon should it be changed or left the way it is gou 20:10 10 october 2009 utc this make a good fac cu bo ne king 03:16 17 november 2009 utc considering that there are now seasons as of generation v does that mean that we can expect to be able to get the eeveelutions in black and white pokemon26 20:02 23 october 2010 utc thank you for apologizing dennou zenshi i was just asking about the eeveelutions just because i wanted to know if that was possible i knew that all the pokemon for generation 5 were released a month ago. pokemon26 00:44 24

01:59 12 november 2012 utc while having each one 's individual chart is nice what about a collective chart comparing them like the legendary trio pages have drake clawfang talk 03:57 27 january 2013 utc we can add a generation vi subsection and state that ninfia will be available in it also for the anime section we can add a bit about how all of them will be featured in the upcoming short before the next movie and the number of eeveelutions at the top of the page needs to be changed from seven to eight. cooldudeal talk 23:43 12 february 2013 utc no this is not possible ever since gs in-game party is only six in those generation you could use eevee in one slot and all five of its then evolutions in the remaining five slots not possible post-generation iii because eevee has more than 5 evolutions hoenn master 19:05 13 february 2013 utc there 's a minor typo needs fixing on the last bullet point in the trivia section unless it it traded to black and white should say unless it is traded i 'd have done it myself but the page is currently locked due to sylveon 's announcement digifiend talk 14:51 14 february 2013 utc i made a new version to include sylveon well others did that too but they just pasted its artwork onto the old image which does n't look very nice can i change it ★~darklight~★ 16:25 14 february 2013 utc how about a circular arrangement here 1 is the picture i made ★~darklight~★ 19:25 15 february 2013 utc except it shows up as a badly stretched version of the old image for me you ca n't keep that image when sylveon 's type is revealed anyway ★~darklight~★ 23:23 15 february 2013 utc i think that i ca n't edit the page so i was wondering if someone that can would change the picture at the top that shows all the eeveelutions to this 2 mohacastle hear my roar 21:34 14 february 2013 utc how correct is this can you trade pokemon between bw2 and bw1 before beating the pokémon league in bw2 or should it say trading to a bw2 player who has beaten the pokémon league stratelier 07:46 15 february 2013 utc ummm yes it is i 've traded multiple times between my black and black2 before beating the legue ★~darklight~★ 19:25 15 february 2013 utc since sylveon 's official art has been revealed can someone change the image of sylveon in the corocoro scan with her official art pkmnadventurer talk 00:48 16 february 2013 utc the article does n't look right the way it is right now it has a sub-subsection for each pokémon until gen vi it may not have much information for the subsection or another known evolution in the generation for the gen vi subsection but it does n't fit with the rest of the article evs and ivsaurs 20:41 21 february 2013 utc can we just make it the same as all the others but with as the stats i have no idea how to do the username thing -poko907 sorry for the derp-up a few minutes ago i hope i 've rerolled the changes correctly i seem to be unable to add an extra column with sylveon 's stats to the base stat comparison table is it due to how the template is coded malenfant talk 12:32 26 october 2013 utc made a template two options available one is a template located at user drake clawfang/sandbox2 that could be moved to the mainspace the original sandbox has the template ready to transplant here too the other was adapted from the movelist table here since the current style of stat table does n't seem to have an image for sylveon so i 'm not sure what would be wanted drake clawfang talk 04:39 6 november 2013 utc why does umbreon 's section state that as of generation 2 it is the only eeveelution uniquely suited to defending more than attacking when the very best vaporeon builds for that generation are all tank builds i think that this is someones opinion and should not be stated as fact on a bulbapedia page nokota talk 19:15 6 march 2014 utc because we do n't know sylveon 's catch rate can we hide this piece of trivia about catch rates for now until sylveon 's catch rate is from the official pokémon website cinday123 talk 08:26 15 march 2014 utc is it worth pointing out that despite eevee and two other eeveelutions being able to learn bite by level up the dark-type eeveelution can not pkmnadventurer talk 22:04 2 june 2014 utc i was watching this youtube channel called thenationaldex and they did a special episode on sylveon and said that the designer confirmed by ken sugimori himself to be atsuko nishida also designed the other members of the eevee family now they are known for doing their research they do n't just spout b.s but i ca n't find any mention of this anywhere all sources i can find say ken sugimori designed all the pokémon in existence which we all know for a fact is not true atsuko has also been confirmed as the sole designer of pikachu and it 's been stated that others also designed kanto pokémon as well and we all know that other designers have gotten their 'mons into the game like the vanilla line and such so can anyone confirm or deny all nine eeveelutions being atsuko 's babies if this is true she probably already has designs for the other nine remaining types waiting to be submitted not to mention a normal-type eeveelution or mega p blackbutterfree talk 05:08 6 july 2014 utc in gen i all the then current eeveelutions shared a base special attack stat of 110 is it worth noting this in the trivia where it talks about the similar stats terry152 talk 08:16 14 august 2014 utc is there a know priority for the eeveelutions that could conceivably have their evolutionary conditions met at the same time as others specifically if one were to level up an eevee near a mossy or icy rock while it has the necessary friendship to evolve into espeon/umbreon and knows a fairy-type move with at least two hearts of affection which would it evolve into what would it evolve into if two of these conditions were met is it random would the game just explode or something masternachos talk 22:09 8 february 2016 utc should there be a separate page for the eevee users in sun and moon the eevee users are the people you must battle to acquire the eevium z unsigned comment from reshiespeon talk • contribs i feel it should be noted in the trivia section that every eeveelution is a type that was considered special not physical before the physical/special split of gen 4 with the exception of sylveon since fairy did n't exist before that split and possibly that the only special type that is n't represented in the eeveelutions is dragon should this be added yumiscott talk 01:13 12 april 2017 utc
