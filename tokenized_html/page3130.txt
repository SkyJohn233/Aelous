directory entries using data browsers managing oracle virtual directory schema using oracle directory services manager this topic describes oracle virtual directory data browsers and how to use them to manage oracle virtual directory entries this topic contains the following sections understanding oracle virtual directory data browsers managing oracle virtual directory entries using the client view data browser searching and viewing oracle virtual directory source entries using the adapter browser oracle virtual directory provides the following types of data browsers client view browser adapter browser both the client view and adapter browsers are automatically created when you define a new oracle virtual directory server oracle virtual directory uses dsmlv2 over its administrative gateway to retrieve the data presented by the browsers client view browser the client view browser allows you to view and search the entire virtual directory tree defined by all configured adapters after oracle virtual directory has performed all data mapping and transformation think of the client view as the after view what the data looks like after it is virtualized by oracle virtual directory you can also import and export ldif files to and from the oracle virtual directory using the client view data browser ldif is an industry standard textual interchange format designed for exchanging data between ldap servers ldif files are typically used to import and export batch data and schema configuration changes adapter browser the adapter browser allows you to search data as it exists in ldap adapter connected repositories and view data as it exists in both ldap and database adapter connected repositories think of the adapter browser view as the before view what the data in ldap and database repositories looks like before it is virtualized by oracle virtual directory when using the adapter browser to view databases tables and fields appear as they exist in the original database including sample table rows to assist in data modeling note the client view browser allows you to view and search the entire virtual directory tree defined by all configured adapters after oracle virtual directory has performed all data mapping and transformation you can also use the client view browser to import and export ldif files to and from the virtual directory this topic explains how to perform the following client view browser tasks searching the virtual directory tree viewing oracle virtual directory entries importing an ldif file exporting an ldif file you can search the virtual directory tree using the client view data browser there are two types of searches simple and advanced a simple search will search only the cn uid sn givenname mail and initials attributes an advanced search allows you to specify the search scope depth and other detailed search parameters to perform a simple search perform the following steps log in to oracle directory services manager select data browsers from the task selection bar the data browsers navigation tree appears select the client view entry in the data browsers tree enter the keyword you want to search for in the search field at the top of the data browsers tree and click the simple search icon to perform an advanced search perform the following steps log in to oracle directory services manager select data browsers from the task selection bar the data browsers navigation tree appears select the client view entry in the data browsers tree click the advanced button at the top of the data browsers tree the search dialog box appears enter the starting point for the search in the root of the search field enter the maximum number of entries for the search to return in the max results entries field select the depth scope for the search by selecting one of the following options from the search depth list base searches only the entries at the location specified by the root of the search field one level searches all entries one level under the location specified by the root of the search field subtree searches the location specified by the root of the search field and includes all entries under that location enter in the maximum number of seconds for the search to execute in the max search time seconds field enter the search criteria as follows select the attribute to search for by selecting the attribute name from the list of attributes select a matching rule from the list of matching rules enter a value for the matching rule in the specify matching value field you can delete a search criterion by clicking the delete button next to it note click search to execute the search perform the following steps to view entries in the oracle virtual directory using the client view data browser log in to oracle directory services manager select data browsers from the task selection bar the data browsers tree appears expand the client view entry in the data browsers tree the namespaces of the entries in the virtual directory appear navigate to the content you want to view by expanding the appropriate namespace click the entry you want to view the properties screen appears displaying the attributes and objectclasses for that entry you can adjust which attributes are shown and which attributes are hidden in the properties screen by clicking the show all or hide empty values option at the top-right of the screen perform the following steps to import ldif files into the oracle virtual directory using the client view data browser verify the ldif file you want to import has a valid version number in the first line in the file oracle virtual directory requires all ldif files that will be imported to contain this version number at the beginning of the file if the file does not have a version number in the first line add version 1 to the beginning of the file log in to oracle directory services manager select data browsers from the task selection bar the data browsers tree appears expand the client view entry in the data browsers tree select the location where you want to import the ldif file to by clicking the appropriate namespace in the client view entry in the tree click the import ldif button at the top of the tree the import file dialog box appears enter the path of the ldif file you want to import in the select an ldif file field or click the browse button and navigate to the file click the ok button on the import file dialog box to import the ldif file perform the following steps to export ldif files from the oracle virtual directory using the client view data browser log in to oracle directory services manager select data browsers from the task selection bar the data browsers tree appears expand the client view entry in the data browsers tree select the location where you want to export the ldif file from by clicking the appropriate namespace in the client view entry in the tree click the export ldif button at the top of the data browsers tree the download ldif file dialog box appears note open the ldif file in your browser by clicking the click here to open the ldif file link in the download ldif file dialog box note after clicking the click here to open the ldif file link in the download ldif file dialog box the ldif file appears in a new separate browser window use your browser 's save command to save the ldif file the adapter browser allows you to search data as it exists in ldap adapter connected repositories and view data as it exists in both ldap and database adapter connected repositories the adapter browser allows you to see what data looks like before it is virtualized by oracle virtual directory this topic explains how to perform the following adapter browser tasks note searching oracle virtual directory source entries viewing oracle virtual directory source entries you can search data as it exists in ldap and database adapter connected repositories using the adapter browser there are two types of searches simple and advanced a simple search will search only the cn uid sn givenname mail and initials attributes an advanced search allows you to specify the search scope depth and other detailed search parameters to perform a simple search perform the following steps log in to oracle directory services manager select data browsers from the task selection bar the data browsers navigation tree appears select the adapter browser entry in the data browsers tree enter the keyword you want to search for in the search field at the top of the data browsers tree and click the simple search icon to perform an advanced search perform the following steps log in to oracle directory services manager select data browsers from the task selection bar the data browsers navigation tree appears select the adapter browser entry in the data browsers tree click the advanced button at the top of the data browsers tree the search dialog box appears enter the starting point for the
