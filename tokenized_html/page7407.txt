company on their blog let 's talk wine it is reused here with their permission this is the dawn of a new era for california wines after years of trending in overly oaked chardonnay and highly extracted pinot noir in california a new ethic has been introduced into winemaking balance in the country that invented coca-cola and mcdonald s we have grown accustomed to the predictability of taste—even in our wines—and obvious uniform and sweet flavors have historically won out over nuance and subtlety it only makes sense that big bold hit-you-over-the-head wines were once in vogue in america however much has changed since that era as americans are developing a greater conscientiousness around the provenance of food and drink our palates are evolving too continue reading posted in food in the middle of winter is there anything as unappealing as a sad mealy tomato from the grocery store that s reason alone to celebrate the arrival of summer bursting with ripe juice enticing with sweet viney aromas and diverse in color and shape tomatoes become worthy of their fruit status this past weekend i attended a tomato party that a friend of a friend has been hosting in san francisco annually for the last nine years everyone was asked to bring a different tomato-based dish but this was no half-baked pot-luck—everyone thought outside of the box while there were plenty of classic tomato recipes including a gourmet grilled cheese and tomato soup the number of unique dishes present would make your head spin i ll let you in on a few of my favorites continue reading posted in

first person to blog about the benefits of light-bodied red wines and i hope i m not the last a crusade like this is worth fighting for not only are such wines easier on the palate but they pair with the largest variety of dishes the secret lies in the high acidity of the wine which stimulates the saliva in the mouth rather than tannins which can dry out your gums in his heyday robert parker was

red meat which might have you reaching for more water rather than wine where s the pleasure in that continue reading posted in food having italian blood on both sides of the family has certainly allowed me my fair share of pasta the italian-american tradition of pasta marinara on sundays has always been a highly anticipated meal of the week without which i feel something is missing but tonight i finally tried the pasta dish that may just surpass all others cacío e pepe —or cheese and pepper so simple so ridiculously fast and easy to prepare and so incredibly gratifying am i subject to hyperbole let s just say it s in the dna but the thought of denying oneself the pleasure of this grown-up macaroni n'cheese seems silly cacio e pepe has always seemed intriguing to me i ve read about it for years but i never really got around to making it maybe i imagined that it could never surpass a traditional marinara a sinful carbonara or an oily pesto over the last few weeks my boyfriend john was eager to go see a new spice shop in oakland that opened over the last year—the oaktown spice shop the store was beautiful the gentlemen working there were knowledgeable and
