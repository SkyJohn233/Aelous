site-selective direct arylation of unprotected adenine nucleosides mediated by palladium and copper insights into the reaction mechanism sciencedirect sciencedirect reaction conditions facilitating the site-selective direct aryl functionalisation at the c-8 position of adenine nucleosides have been identified many different aromatic components may be effectively cross-coupled to provide a diverse array of arylated adenine nucleoside products without the need for ribose or adenine protecting groups the optimal palladium catalyst loading lies between 0.5 and 5 mol addition of excess mercury to the reaction had a negligible affect on catalysis suggesting the involvement of a homogeneous catalytic species a study by transmission electron microscopy tem shows that metal containing nanoparticles ca 3 nm with good uniformity are formed during the latter stages of the reaction stabilised pvp palladium colloids pvp= n -polyvinylpyrrolidone are catalytically active in the direct arylation process releasing homogenous palladium into solution the effect of various substituted 2-pyridine ligand additives has been investigated a mechanism for the site-selective arylation of adenosine is proposed download download full-size image c -modified nucleosides are widely used as ph sensors fluorescent markers therapeutic agents and supramolecular building blocks 1 studies that probe biomolecular structure and biochemical mechanisms 2 2 a 2 b 2 c 2 d 2 e are of fundamental importance driving the need for the development of efficient synthetic methods to access structurally diverse non-natural nucleosides particularly purines there are several ways to functionalise purine compounds sonogashira suzuki and stille cross-coupling hereafter coupling processes catalysed by palladium 0 3 are routinely used to access arylated purine nucleosides scheme 1 4 4 a 4 b 4 c historically the protection of both the sugar hydroxyl groups and the reactive heteroaromatic substituents was required for successful couplings however recent studies have demonstrated that unprotected halogenated nucleosides may be effectively cross-coupled with various nucleophilic components 5 5 a 5 b 5 c arguably more remarkable are the findings that suzuki–miyaura cross-couplings are possible on halogenated triphosphate purine bases 6 7 7 a 7 b this despite the thermal and base sensitivity of the phosphoester bonds in the triphosphate moiety scheme 1 representative cross-couplings of unprotected purines with various nucleophilic components toxic reagents e.g. organostannanes limit the use of stille couplings in industrial scale-up processes and whilst organoboronic acids are versatile coupling components for suzuki–miyaura couplings in some cases their stability protodeborylation can be problematic particularly in certain heteroaromatic components furthermore these reactions can not generally be viewed as atom economic transformations for example only the phenyl group 77 mu is transferred from phsnbu 3 and the rest is waste 290 mu a problem derived from the need for prefunctionalisation in the nucleophilic component to combat these key issues greener and more efficient methods for aryl functionalisation continue to be identified generally protocols for direct arylation of organic compounds 8 by c–h functionalisation including the site-selective modification 9 of electron-rich heteroaromatics 10 have reached a point where they may be applied to more challenging molecular architecture 11 11 a 11 b 11 c 11 d with the primary aim of adding to the contemporary portfolio of modified molecular probes for practical use in bioapplications we wished to investigate whether catalytic direct arylation methods can be employed for the synthesis of unprotected purine nucleosides in unison with our studies hocek and co-workers recently disclosed that protected purines can be arylated at the 8-position using catalytic palladium in the presence of excess cui in dmf at 160 °c for 60 h. 12 however no sugar variants were given our studies on the site-selective direct arylation of purine nucleosides are reported in this paper 13 on consideration of the structures of the nucleosides a problem that emerges is the potential instability of the glycosyl bond at high temperatures e.g. 160 °c for adenosine the t 1/2 8000 h at 90–100 °c in water or formamide 14 site selectivity 9 15 further needs to be considered c-arylation can potentially occur at c2 or c8 fig 1 whilst accurate experimental p k a values for the c–h bonds in adenosine are not known based on the theoretical p k a values determined for 9-methyl-9 h -purine in dmso h2=40.3 h8=29.3 16 we predict that preferential c–h activation should occur at site 1 n-arylation is further possible—a recent report details that a pd–xantphos catalytic system can promote selective n-arylation of protected 2′-deoxyadenosines and 2′-deoxyguanosines with aryl bromides 17 figure 1 potential sites of reaction for c–h and n–h bonds in adenosine initially reaction conditions reported in the literature for direct arylation of various heteroaromatic compounds were screened to assess whether reactions of adenosine with aryl iodides were possible using standard arylation conditions pd oac 2 p t -bu 3 ·hbf 4 phcl or phbr k 3 po 4 dma 100 °c 24 h or pd oac 2 phbr naoac 120 °c 20 h negligible direct arylation was seen more success was had using the conditions described by bellina and rossi 18 18 a 18 b 18 c which are similar to those reported by hocek and co-workers 12 however deglycosylation was found to be an issue at high temperatures over prolonged reaction times on monitoring a reaction at 160 °c by hplc it was revealed that direct arylation had occurred within minutes on consumption and through extensive deglycosylation of adenosine any remaining phi rapidly homocoupled to give biphenyl deglycosylation of the cross-coupled product then occurred steadily over the course of several hours running the reaction at 120 °c improved the reaction efficacy considerably the product profile is shown in scheme 2 note homocoupling of adenosine was not observed under these conditions 19 scheme 2 product evolution profile for direct arylation of adenosine with iodobenzene monitored by hplc open circles=8-phenyladenosine rapid colour changes are observed in reaction mixtures of adenosine and iodobenzene fig 2 after 5 min of heating a yellow/orange colour was evident plate a which changed to a green/brown colour after 25 min ∼30 conversion plate b after 1.5 h the formation of metal containing nanoparticles was observed in the reaction mixture ∼65 conversion plate c figure 2 colour changes during direct arylation of adenosine with iodobenzene a at 5 min b at 25 min c at 1.5 h the ph upon work-up should be ∼6.5 which allows the product to be extracted with an ethyl acetate/isopropanol solvent mixture 9:1 subjecting the crude product to chromatography on silica gel gave

finally microwave heating is ineffective for direct arylation of adenosine due to significant decomposition mainly deglycosylation table 1 evaluation of different palladium sources for direct

e -dien-3-one dm-dba=1,5-bis- 3′,5′-dimethoxyphenyl penta-1 e ,4 e -dien-3-one having identified the key reaction/work-up parameters a library of aryl halides were evaluated for direct arylation of adenosine table 2 a series of para -substituted aryl iodides afforded the 8-arylated purine products in good yields entries 1–4 remarkably ionisable substituents e.g. oh and nh 2 groups are also tolerated entries 5 and 6 respectively substrates possessing electron-deficient ortho -substituents are not accepted for c-arylation entries 7 and 10 catellani and co-workers reported that the ortho -trifluoromethyl group can interact with pd ii reducing its subsequent reactivity in norbornene-assisted arylation processes 22 on switching this substituent to the meta position the coupled product was formed in good yield entry 8 in the presence of a meta -nitro substituent the cross-coupled product was obtained in modest yield entry 11 the p -nitro substituent gave the best yield from the most strongly electron-deficient substituent series entry 12 iodonapthalene couples in near quantitative yield entry 13 quite remarkably the chemoselectivity was reversed when an ortho -nitro substituent is present—n-arylation emerged as the exclusive reaction pathway fig 3 table 2 direct arylation of adenosines with aryl halides download download full-size image yield obtained after chromatography on silica gel the number in brackets refers to selective n 6-mono-arylation figure 3 n-arylation products of adenosine we have established that 1,4-diiodobenzene can also be used as an arylation substrate scheme 3 despite using fewer equivalents of 1,4-diiodobenzene 0.5 rather than 2 equiv with respect to the adenosine both 1,4-di- 8′-adenosinyl benzene and 8- p -iodophenyl adenosine were formed in this reaction albeit in low yield non-optimised these compounds could be useful in supramolecular assembly or ligand design scheme 3 reaction of adenosine with 1,4-diiodobenzene 2′-deoxyadenosine can also be arylated under the standard conditions by slight modification to the reaction conditions at 120 °c substantial deglycosylation was observed giving 8-phenyladenine scheme 4 reflecting the lower stability of 2′-deoxyribose however arylation worked well at 80 °c giving the coupled product in 84 yield scheme 4 arylation of 2′-deoxyadenosine having developed a generic set of conditions for the direct arylation of adenosine and 2′-deoxyadenosine we felt that some of the observations made in the study warranted further investigation several parameters have been probed to assess their impact on the benchmark reaction scheme 2 with a view to gaining additional insight into the reaction mechanism most of the direct arylation reactions produced a strong amine odour most likely due to degradation of dmf to give me 2 nh and co↑ to test the importance of the degradation process a standard reaction was performed in the presence of 2.5 equiv of et 2 nh in this case the additive slowed down the catalytic turnover 38 yield by contrast the reaction does proceed in the presence of 2.5 equiv of et 2 nh in the absence of cs 2 co 3 albeit slowly and in low yield 18 to establish whether trace quantities of co vide supra could be influencing these reactions co was generated in situ by employing co 2 co 8 a reagent which rapidly decomposes under thermal heating in polar solvents such as dmf and dmso thus co 2 co 8 10 mol was added to the benchmark reaction at t =0 upon heating rapid co evolution was evident after ca 5 min a palladium black precipitate was produced this palladium black was catalytically inactive inferred by the finding that negligible direct arylation was seen over a period of 13 h adenosine degradation accounts for the majority of the consumed material furthermore a trace quantity of the n-arylation product was obtained in 3 yield see fig 3 it has been noted that all the reactions from this study produced black heterogeneous mixtures after 13 h. fagnou and campeau reported similar observations in palladium-catalysed direct arylation reactions 11b generally it is well established that addition of hg 0 poisons metal 0 heterogeneous catalysts 23 through amalgamation of the metal catalyst or through surface adsorption this is perhaps the most popular test for the homogeneous versus heterogeneous catalysis question 24 the suppression of catalysis by a large excess of hg 0 in a well-stirred solution is seen as evidence for a heterogeneous catalyst where catalysis continues it is inferred that the reaction is homogeneous it should be noted that the hg 0 poison test is not a universal test for all metal catalysts some caution is necessary as hg 0 can react with certain mononuclear transition metal complexes 25 25 a 25 b general rules for the use of this test and other means for addressing the homogeneous versus heterogeneous question in transition metal catalysed processes have been clearly defined by finke and co-workers 26 26 a 26 b the hg 0 poison test has also been used to test for heterogeneous behaviour in related c–h activation processes mediated by pd oac 2 where no catalyst inhibition was observed 27 hg 0 ca 325 equiv was added to the benchmark reaction after 25 min at 120 °c ∼30 conversion to product by hplc further conversion to product was recorded up to 45 min ∼65–70 thus hg 0 does not quench the reaction note a deleterious secondary reaction of either hg 0 or hg ii with 8-phenyladenosine was noticeable after 45 min deglycosylation the fact that the reaction continues in the presence of hg 0 points to homogeneous species playing a key role in the reaction it is worthy of note that galvinoxyl radical 28 a common test for the participation of radical mechanisms where addition of an exogenous radical is assumed to slow or stop a radical-mediated reaction had no affect on the global efficacy of the benchmark reaction giving 8-phenyladenosine in 65 yield sames and lane reported that the arylation reactions of n -substituted indoles were accompanied by significant homocoupling of iodobenzene at higher pd loadings 29 for the direct arylation reactions described herein at 120 °c this was not an issue furthermore on lowering the pd oac 2 loading to 0.5 mol a 51 yield of the arylated product was obtained lowering the loading further by an order of magnitude 0.05 mol pd oac 2 gave only a 9 yield tem has been widely used to characterise metal containing nanoparticles in a variety of different reactions 30 30 a 30 b 30 c 30 d two 1 ml samples were removed from the benchmark reaction after 1.5 h for analysis by tem the first sample was concentrated under high vacuum at 40 °c to remove the dmf the crude black solid was resuspended in ethanol and subjected to analysis by tem one concern was that in removing the dmf a potential metal colloid stabiliser we would be artificially favouring the formation of aggregated metal species thus to the second sample we added n -polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp m w =29,000 20 monomer equivalents with respect to pd to stabilise any metal nanoparticles that were formed a comparison of the tem micrographs for each sample revealed similar sized metal containing nanoparticles fig 4 figure 4 a tem micrograph of unstabilised metal containing nanoparticles b pvp stabilised metal containing nanoparticles c percentage distribution of metal containing nanoparticles by imagej shown using kaleidagraph the nanoparticles contained within the unstabilised reaction sample were analysed further by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps to identify whether both cu and pd are present and to determine their oxidation states figure 5 shows the pd 3d and cu 2p regions which revealed the presence of both pd 0 and pd ii species with characteristic 3d 5/2 binding energies of 335.9 and 337.8 ev respectively and a significant amount of cu i with a 2p 3/2 binding energy of 932.7 ev quantification of the cu 2p and pd 3d regions revealed that the cu/pd atomic ratio is ∼19:1 theoretical ratio=60:1 xps is a surface technique thus this difference can be explained by the presence of larger particles containing bulk cu i the presence of mixed pd–cu species can not be confirmed from xps alone however the high pd content might be attributed to pd segregation to form a capped pd–cu particle the presence of other higher oxidation state cu species such as those derived from cu ii can be ruled out due to the absence of any characteristic cu 2p satellite peaks approximately 8 ev above the main photoelectron peak 31 figure 5 a pd 3d spectrum of post-reaction sample b cu 2p spectrum of post-reaction sample palladium colloids stabilised by pvp were synthesised according to the method described by el-sayed and narayanan 32 32 a 32 b a characterised pd–pvp colloid average particle size=2 nm was tested as a substitute for pd oac 2 the amount of pd–pvp colloid added corresponds to 0.5 mol pd remarkably pd–pvp was an efficient mediator of the reaction producing the direct arylation product in 51 yield after 13 h it is interesting to note that a larger pd–pvp colloid average particle size=3.4 nm performed less well in the reaction 18 yield after 13 h indicating that there is a particle size dependence on catalytic activity further studies are in progress to elucidate the origin of this phenomenon download download full-size image the addition of sub-stoichiometric amounts of electron-deficient pyridines has been shown to be beneficial for certain direct arylation processes 33 33 a 33 b it can be postulated that this additive stabilises catalytically active pd 0 species 34 and may also increase the reactivity electrophilicity of pd ii species 33a we have investigated a range of substituted pyridines to assess their effect on the reaction of adenosine and iodobenzene under the optimised reaction conditions table 3 addition of 3-nitropyridine to the generic reaction gave the arylated product in 95 yield entry 1 the other pyridines lowered the yield of the c -arylated product as compared to the benchmark reaction entries 2–5 the electron-releasing substituents on the pyridine appeared to reduce the global efficacy of the reaction entries 4 and 5 more critical was the observation that despite the effectiveness of 3-nitropyridine as an additive in the benchmark reaction other aryl halide reactions did not benefit from its addition for example 4-acetylphenyl iodide and 3-trifluoromethylphenyl iodide reacted with adenosine in yields of 23 and 47 respectively which are markedly lower than the yields observed in the absence of this additive compare entries 3 and 8 table 1 the beneficial effect of the 3-nitropyridine on direct arylation appears to be substrate dependent table 3 effect of substituted pyridines on the direct arylation of adenosine with iodobenzene a reaction conditions as for scheme 2 yield obtained after chromatography on silica gel deprotonation at c8 of adenosine occurs under arylation conditions in the absence of metal this was confirmed by a control experiment using acetone- d 6 as a source of deuterium in the presence of cs 2 co 3 in dmf at 120 °c for 10 h scheme 5 a near complete exchange occurred at c8 within 10 h at this temperature and there was no evidence for deuterium incorporation at c2 scheme 5 deprotonation at the c8 position of adenosine adenosine as a substrate is a complicated ligand with several possible coordination modes to palladium 35 35 a 35 b 35 c monomers such as i are known fig 6 as are dimeric and higher order complexes where n 7 is the dominant ligating atom similar copper complexes can also be formed e.g. ii figure 6 possible intermediates in the direct arylation of purines in terms of the reaction mechanism an electrophilic substitution via intermediate iii can be proposed in accord with the proposals made by miura in the arylation of thiazoles and imidazoles 36 gevorgyan in the arylation of indolizines 37 and daugulis for arylations of caffeine and other electron-rich heterocycles 10 however counting against this is the susceptibility of intermediate iii towards deglycosylation amine coordination 38 from the adenine ring system to cu i aids activation of the c–h bond as in structure ii the stoichiometric requirement for cu i is key to the direct arylation of adenosine which mirrors the observations made by bellina rossi and co-workers 18 18 a 18 b 18 c for the direct arylation of imidazoles these researchers proposed that the imidazole exists in equilibrium with the corresponding organocuprate derivative not directly observed the in situ generation of such species is supported by literature precedent 39 39 a 39 b which shows that cu i salts can metallate acidic c–h bonds specifically the c-2 position of imidazoles which are expected to possess similar acidity to the c-8 position in adenosine whilst cui would be expected to act as a co-catalyst in this reaction it is likely that higher concentrations are necessary to increase the concentration of the organocuprate in solution from our study it is pertinent to point out that the xps data indicates the presence of cu i species only the negative hg 0 poison test strongly supports the involvement of homogeneous catalytic species in the direct arylations of adenosine however metal containing nanoparticles are formed under the reaction conditions in classical cross-coupling reactions an inverse correlation e.g. higher turnover frequencies at lower palladium catalyst loadings for pd oac 2 and various palladacycles in heck sonogashira and suzuki cross-couplings has been used as circumstantial evidence implicating palladium clusters/nanoparticles in catalytic turnover 40 moreover at lower global palladium concentrations there is a higher concentration of mononuclear species capable of promoting the homogenous cross-coupling reaction whilst the palladium/substrate ratio is important the observations made in our study indicate that relatively high palladium loadings are necessary for optimum conversions in a heck reaction 41 of bromobenzene and n -butyl acrylate mediated by pd oac 2 in nmp at 135 °c negligible catalytic turnover was observed at a concentration of palladium similar to that used in the direct arylations of adenosine oxidative addition is proposed to be rate limiting in the case of bromobenzene leading to aggregation of pd 0 a particular problem at 1 mol pd oac 2 catalyst loadings in the case of iodobenzene oxidative addition is fast and gives a higher concentration of ph–pd–i moreover adenosine is capable of stabilising such a complex via n 7 coordination to pd as is the solvent dmf and a pyridine additive such n-coordination will increase arylation efficacy the ullmann-type homocoupling of iodobenzene formed via halide bridged pd ii dimers/disproportionation 42 or via ar 2 l 2 pdx − species 43 would be slowed down in that case the beneficial effect of in situ generated me 2 nh formed by degradation of dmf also producing co g remains unclear at this stage sames and co-workers 44 reported that addition of i pr 2 nh dramatically improved the yields obtained in the pd-catalysed c2-arylation of indoles by increasing the rate of oxidative addition of the aryl halide to pd 0 a higher concentration of the ph–pd–x species also led to increased amounts of biphenyl for phbr it remains a possibility that a sub-stoichiometric amount of me 2 nh could assist the direct arylations of adenosine addition of 10 mol co 2 co 8 to the benchmark reaction led to rapid co evolution and rapid palladium black formation which was catalytically inactive for c-arylation co is an excellent π-acceptor ligand which will reduce the reactivity of pd 0 species the study on pvp–pd stabilised colloids revealed that such species are catalytically active under the benchmark conditions these heterogenised sources release catalytically active pd 0 into solution either monomeric or small clusters allowing the homogeneous reaction to take place 45 in the direct arylations mediated by pd oac 2 the tem micrographs reveal that metal containing nanoparticles are formed which are ca 3–4 nm after 1.5 h ∼65 conversion a key question remaining unanswered is what is their role in the reaction the deprotonation experiment performed in the absence of metal indicates that h/d exchange takes place under arylation conditions based on the assumption that ring-opening 46 of the purine heterocycle is unlikely we propose that cu i is able to assist deprotonation at c8 in adenosine a base-assisted deprotonation reaction leads to the in situ generation of an organocuprate path a scheme 6 which then participates in transmetallation with the pd ii intermediate species in the catalytic cycle isomerisation and reductive elimination reveal the arylated adenosine regenerating pd 0 in the process aggregation of pd 0 species and potential cu species emerges as an issue during the latter stages of the reaction where the concentration of iodobenzene is low a point supported by the formation of metal containing nanoparticles vide supra scheme 6 proposed mechanism for the direct arylation of adenosine mediated by pd/cu in the presence of cs 2 co 3 in summary valuable reaction conditions for the direct aryl functionalisation of unprotected adenosines have been developed deglycosylation has been identified as a major issue using similar conditions to those described previously for protected adenines and other direct arylation processes the above synthetic protocol allows c8-arylated adenosines to be obtained in one step in suzuki–miyaura cross-couplings there is an absolute requirement for the prefunctionalisation of adenosine bromination which subsequently requires the use of an organoboronic acid a pragmatic point to consider is that stoichiometric quantities of cui are required for direct arylation of adenosine thus one has to remain open-minded about what type of c8-aryl functionalisation might be required for a given target and/or application—suzuki–miyaura cross-coupling will be a competitive alternative for certain structures the direct arylation protocol is not intended to replace suzuki–miyaura cross-coupling procedures rather it serves to complement this key synthetic methodology further mechanistic studies to confirm links between classical cross-coupling and direct arylation coupling processes are ongoing in our laboratories perhaps more generally some of the observations reported in this study highlight the challenges faced in the palladium catalysis field particularly in developing practical synthetic methodologies for the
