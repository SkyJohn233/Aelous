should you hand your pension money to the government money the guardian publicly owned nest with its low charges and cost is causing panic in the pension industry publicly owned nest with its low charges and cost is causing panic in the pension industry patrick collinson tue 9 sep 2014 08.43 edt last modified on thu 30 nov 2017 04.06 est the pensions industry for so long riddled with absurd charges and overpaid and underperforming fund managers finally has a real competitor it s called the british government in a little-noticed technical change slipped out on monday the department for work and pensions has lifted the cap on contributions into the government scheme it set up in 2012 and said people can transfer in their pension pots from past employers the move in effect turns the government into a no-nonsense cheap alternative to the likes of aviva standard life and legal general – and underlines just how much the british public has been overcharged until now from the moment the scheme – national employment savings trust or nest – was set up the private pensions industry sought to handicap it hedging it in with a multitude of restrictions why because it showed up the industry for the overcharging beast it had become unlike the private providers nest said it could perfectly well manage small contributions that may stop and start for example while on maternity leave it does so without public subsidy for an annual charge of 0.3 of the person s money that number horrified the pensions industry which has routinely milked members for between 1 and 3 a year – money used to pay fund managers £1m-plus salaries and fat commissions to brokers it declared nest was unfair competition and demanded it be allowed only to take workers who paid in small amounts the customers they didn t want anyway and that it be banned from accepting transfers of big company schemes their juiciest customers sadly the government caved in at the time but yesterday pensions minister steve webb lifted the restrictions – albeit only from 2017 the date when the staging of auto-enrolment from large employers down to the smallest is finally completed nest keeps its costs low chiefly by investing members money in cheap tracker funds matching the performance of an index rather than actively managed funds where star managers pocket millions of pounds individually – but where the evidence shows that almost none consistently beat the index also it doesn t have to shell out dividends to shareholders since nest started it has attracted 1 million members the private pension companies have begun cutting their charges but few match nest from next april they will be dragged and they re already screaming by steve webb into a new regime whereby they will be banned from charging more than 0.75 charges matter an individual earning £20,000 would save around £35,500 over their lifetime if they saved in a scheme with a 0.75 charge compared to a 1 charge – and much more if they are in nest standard life is already reported as having made provisions of £160m and scottish widows £100m to cope with the cap – but few will shed any tears for their shareholders nest isn t perfect – as tom mcphail of hargreaves lansdown points out apart from its 0.3 annual charge it imposes a 1.8 initial fee which means it is more expensive than others if the member is say starting in their early 60s and isn t going to contribute for long and while it s ultra-cheap for people accumulating their savings it offers very little for the new world of decumulation – where you drawn down the money during your retirement but even with the initial fee factored in long-term savers will be facing charges that work out at 0.5 a year or a third less than the private providers under the new cap if you are self-employed nest is virtually a no-brainer for many small and medium-sized employers it stacks up extremely well against the private companies it s also an another antidote to the neoliberal wisdom that says private companies good and public corporations bad east coast the train company has cut journey times carried more passengers and achieved higher customer satisfaction since coming under public ownership scottish water which unlike the providers south of the border is a publicly owned company has over the last 10 years gone from charging more than its southern neighbours for water to £54 less in 2013-14 it doesn t have private equity owners or infrastructure fund investors to keep happy what nest east coast scottish water john lewis and nationwide building society show is that publicly owned or mutually operated business models can more than effectively offer services that match or beat the private companies – although perhaps we won t want to dwell too much on the experience of co-operative bank sign in or create your guardian account to join the discussion a government owned run pension fund has worked very well in norway albeit that is run as a sovereign wealth fund and the revenue comes from sources other than personal contributions if it is run anywhere nears as competently in the uk this is a good thing whether or not that is likely is another matter the only difference is that norway isn t about to go broke it runs a surplus 6th largest in the world if anyone thinks the government wont pilfer their money they need their head looked at bonkers well the main difference is that they ve been doing it for years and timed it during the biggest growth in equities ever thus becoming insanely rich £100,00 per head of population or something like that it helps that they still have lots of ongoing oil wealth from statoil to pump into it where as the uk has been spaffing away its oil wealth and will soon lose what is left to the scots thus becoming insanely rich £100,00 per head of population or something like that =========== so what s that going to generate under their rules not much they have to preserve capital values hold on how will the funds be managed who are the fund managers what is their track record i d want to know before i hand over my fund nest keeps its costs low chiefly by investing members money in cheap tracker funds matching the performance of an index rather than actively managed funds where star managers pocket millions of pounds individually – but where the evidence shows that almost none consistently beat the index no managers just follows a tracker nest keeps its costs low chiefly by investing members money in cheap tracker funds matching the performance of an index rather than actively managed funds where star managers pocket millions of pounds individually – but where the evidence shows that almost none consistently beat the index. from the article nest have got loads of fund managers the whole pensions system is a complete mess look up zombie funds if you have a private pension you may be losing out big time the whole pension system is a gigantic con trick when you pay in your pension what happens is they buy shares from pensioners that are about to cash in look at the accounts of any pension fund and you ll see that the amount of money coming in generally matches the amount they pay out plus the interest paid on gilts so essentially all pension schemes including nest operate exactly the same as if the government just taxed people a bit more which is the same as compulsory pension saving then paid a higher state pension and didn t bother issuing any gilts thus leaving the money on deposit at the bank of england if we did that then there would be no cost to pensions at all and all the people working in the pension industry skimming off their earnings from your earnings would have to get a proper job ummmm yeah this isn t how all pension schemes work i think you re talking about schemes which provide a set amount of benefits the money coming into these schemes will broadly match the outgoings because in these scheme employee contributions i.e the money you pay in is towards the payment of all pensions not just your own so there s an overall pot of money which should pay all the pensions in payment and all the pensions which will ever be paid out of the scheme the scheme has already set a benefit it knows roughly how many pensioners there will be in any year and can predict investment returns most pension schemes will have loads of different investment not just gilts unless it only has pensioners in and how much money there is already in the collective pot the idea is to have enough to pay pensions not run a massive profit so if there s not enough in the pot extra contributions are required to make up the difference so yes the incomings should match the outgoings it wouldn t work if they didn t. the majority of pension schemes these days operate nothing like taxation you pay into your own pot that pot is invested and your pension is based on the amount of money you personally and your employer if you re lucky enough to have one who ll contribute have put in the pensions system does have its faults but it doesn t provide some level of security that once you ve earned a pension it can t be taken away contrary to what a lot of people seem to think personally i d be wary of relying solely on a pension provided by that state as you really are just paying for pensioners and once you retire they really can decide to take it away if they decide to ps you could always get a sipp and invest the money yourself and pay any low investment fees you can find when you pay in your pension what happens is they buy shares from pensioners that are about to cash in great article thanks need to go check what my company pension is paying and check to see if i can move to this scheme well if you re in your company pension and they are paying in then dont unfortunately whoever wrote teh article assumed that nest was cheaper than current competiors in teh private sector this is not teh case for a start nest takes 1.8 of every contribution that is made before even consideirng amc s cheers must admit i dont know much about this i presume i cant set up a nest pension scheme and get my company to pay into that ie they will only pay into a scheme that they have picked in which case you would be correct in saying it is not worth moving and instead hope that the company moves to the nest scheme how will the funds be managed who are the fund managers what is their track record i d want to know before i hand over my fund the article says nest keeps its costs low chiefly by investing members money in cheap tracker funds matching the performance of an index rather than actively managed funds where star managers pocket millions of pounds individually – but where the evidence shows that almost none consistently beat the index feel free to put your trust in the star performers i wouldn t join you they should open nest to all individuals not just company-wide transfers i d join if i could at the moment but i can t because my company hasn t chosen to been advised not to by the pension advisers this is great news i know a few people completely ripped of by the pension industry i have long been mistrustful of any investment company that has to pay shareholders a profit and fund manager bonus s. long term the sums don t add up the sooner you can invest yourself in shares for a pension benefiting from tax relief the better currently the tax relief is a subsidy for a corrupt industry it is why i have had to buy to let i have no other pension option without engaging spivs so how are your state pension contributions doing oh dear all gone 100 in charges in effect my state final pension is doing fine thanks i will be getting 80 of my salary upon retirement from day one my state final pension is doing fine thanks ======== no assets 7,200 bn in liabilities rising at 640 bn a year compare to total taxes all of them at 600 bn a year i think you are going to be sadly disappointed consider this a pay your 80 final salary and massively cut the state pension b cut your final salary pension and pay a little less to the masses in state pension i m afraid that you are going to lose that one all because the state didn t invest it spent should you hand your pension money to the government with interest rates on our savings way below inflation in effect we already are mate but equities which most pension savers should be in are returning around 8-9 pa at the moment so it s not all bad not if you measure it over 10 years they aren t. if you re banking on a continued 8-9 return or say 6-7 real then i think you re going to be sorely disappointed because equities are notoriously volatile and will at some stage dip back sharply there must be a way to calculate this properly and integrate over the ups-and-downs of the stock market will think about this the government fund might be run by people with more integrity than the people who work for the pension funds but i don t suppose they will be any more competent so why are they taking 100 of state pension contributions and giving that away 3 in comparison makes you a saint they don t give it away total nonsense yes they do it s unfunded no assets zero the money has gone the money is no more show us the assets if you don t believe me ps an iou to yourself isn t an asset show us the liabilities so we can compare the assets against the liabiltiies i like low charges i like competition if it forces the industry to look seriously at their costs and reduce their charges and do a much better job on transfers i ll be thrilled but it s a bit rich to ignore the huge amount spent to get nest off the ground paid for by all taxpayers and benefitting just those lucky enough to save with nest i d prefer to see more competition reduce barriers to entry raise the limits on the maximum size of pot follows member and use the threat of regulation to see proper stp i think this is a better way to go for customers than price regulation and government subsidised companies i expect steve webb will be kicked out by 2017 and replaced by an big fund funded stooge who will stop this public benefitting nonsense great article i am a no brainer self employed type i still have money in equitable life from a company pension sign in or create your guardian account to recommend a comment before you post
