Basildon Golf Club | Essex | English Golf Courses  Type:   Woodland   Length:   6236   Par:   72   Telephone:   01268533297  Despite its municipal status the course at Basildon Golf Club is a real test of character and nerve, and is kept in fantastic condition all through the year by the diligence and care of the excellent greenkeeping staff. Many public pay and play courses are typecast as poorly looked after  " tattie fields "  - not this one though. In fact, at the risk of sounding controversial, it could more than fairly be said that it is far better than some of it private members rivals.  It sprawls across 6276 yards of beautiful, rolling parkland and offers a championship standard par of 72, a good indication, you will no doubt agree, of the challenges that lie in wait.
