Myopathy is a less common and poorly characterizedadditional neurological manifestation of gluten sensitivity. We present ourexperience with 13 patients who presented with symptoms and signs suggestive of amyopathy and in whom investigation led to the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity.Three of these patients had a neuropathy with or without ataxia in addition tothe myopathy. The mean age at onset of the myopathic symptoms was 54 years. Tenpatients had neurophysiological evidence of myopathy. Inflammatory myopathy wasthe most common finding on neuropathological examination. One patient hadbasophilic rimmed vacuoles suggestive of inclusion-body myositis. Six patientsreceived immunosuppressive treatment in addition to starting on a gluten-freediet; five improved and one remained unchanged. Among seven patients not onimmunosuppressive treatment, four showed clinical improvement of the myopathywith a gluten-free diet. The improvement was also associated with reduction ornormalization of serum creatine kinase level. The myopathy progressed in onepatient who refused the gluten-free diet. Myopathy may be another manifestationof gluten sensitivity and is likely to have an immune-mediated pathogenesis. Agluten-free diet may be a useful therapeutic intervention. ><
