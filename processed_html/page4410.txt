Hi, I have to create ASPxDashboard with two chart(One is Pie, another one is Grid). First Pie chart is static which bind Sales Person and Sum Of SalesAmount. Second Grid chart is dynamic, which means based on first pie chart selection, I have to call new datasource with selected value in First Pie Chart and display the details. List of conditions: =============== Give me sample code to implement. Thanks, Ganesh.R Hello Ganesh, You can accomplish this task by filtering a second data source using parameters.  To learn how to use dashboard parameters, please refer to the following help topic:  Using Dashboard Parameters .  Note that it is possible to hide parameters from the end-users using the  DashboardParameter.Visible  property. When you select records in the pie chart, the  ASPxClientDashboard.ItemMasterFilterStateChanged   event will be raised. You will be able to update parameter values as demonstrated in the  T205300: How to specify dashboard parameter values on the client side in the Web Viewer  example. Please check this solution and let us know whether or not it meets your requirements.
