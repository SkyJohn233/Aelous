ban ends at hey guys what do you think about bringing back the old rengar and i am not talking about his q but the rengar when it was released where you could heal with w ult would give you furacity and having a special item bonetooth what is your opinion guys and explain why ps i am not a fan of reworks at all some of the champs are killed because of that we re testing a new feature that gives the option to view discussion comments in chronological order some testers have pointed out situations in which they feel a linear view could be helpful so we d like see how you guys make use of it no old rengar should never come back simply because of how feast or famine his gameplay was he either got ahead and made playing against him next to impossible or fell behind and became next to useless he had no middle ground and his gameplay pattern was pretty binary because of it and because i m a sucker for this stuff what champions were killed because of their reworks no and no explanation is needed his initial kit was too over the head there were no warnings on his ult no vision range so enemy can detect you your radar vision on enemies in ult was immense and you could stay near anyone while in stealth without them having an idea the boost in armor and magic resist made him too tanky for an assasin that volatile you could stack savagery 3 times which made him impossible to deal with and if you consider in combo with sword of the divine let s say his bola strike point-and-click was bearable i doubt you played him or against it back when he was released i did and i spammed it when i got the chance to do top lane or jungle i am glad they tweaked his kit no oh god no do you realise how bad old rengar was he was a top laner who would first blood you most matches kill towers extremly quickly would use ult to run away and poke you with his e. he was not healthy at all and needed his rework desperately no old rengar should never come back simply because of how feast or famine his gameplay was he either got ahead and made playing against him next to impossible or fell behind and became next to useless he had no middle ground and his gameplay pattern was pretty binary because of it.and because i m a sucker for this stuff what champions were killed because of their reworks in my opinion one of the examples ryze ult edit also i don t think reworking champs increase pick rate it only works for a couple of weeks after that popularity drops i would rather see some dmg boost instead reworking one or more skills oh god no do you realise how bad old rengar was he was a top laner who would first blood you most matches kill towers extremly quickly would use ult to run away and poke you with his e. he was not healthy at all and needed his rework desperately well now he is not that great at top and is only played as jungler i believe there are only few players who manage to play him top but to be honest a decent off/tank with stun can outplay him in my opinion one of the examples ryze ult edit also i don t think reworking champs increase pick rate it only works for a couple of weeks after that popularity drops i would rather see some dmg boost instead reworking one or more skills artrixxhd euw about a year ago in my opinion one of the examples ryze ult edit also i don t think reworking champs increase pick rate it only works for a couple of weeks after that popularity drops i would rather see some dmg boost instead reworking one or more skills eh ryze s ult change didn t really kill him he s still somewhat popular and still does get really strong in the late game as he s meant to and they don t rework champs because they playrate is low they rework when there is something fundamentally broken/unfun to play against/doesn t meet their intended role at all at that point numbers tweaks wouldn t do anything but neuter them well now he is not that great at top and is only played as jungler i believe there are only few players who manage to play him top but to be honest a decent off/tank with stun can outplay him yeah because rengar top isn t all that healthy once the toxic split pushing tactic got removed all he has is his first blood cheese which anyone who played back then knows how to deal with there isn t any reason to bring back top lane rengar there was nothing about it that actually was worth saving game champions gameplay esports new
