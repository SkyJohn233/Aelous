install opencv in a docker container stack overflow by using our site you acknowledge that you have read and understand our cookie policy privacy policy and our terms of service i 'm attempting to dockerise a python application which depends on opencv i 've tried several different ways but i keep getting importerror no module named cv2 when i attempt to run the application here 's my current dockerfile and my requirements.txt file fixed with a slightly different set-up thanks for posting this i ran into the same issue and tried your solution and although it seemed to install opencv it left me with an issue of conflicting versions of the python six library so i took a different route i think a simpler way to do this is to install anaconda in your container and then add opencv i 'm using python 2 so my entire dockerfile to get opencvv installed is just this will install anaconda from the continuumio/anaconda dockerfile and then it will use anaconda to install opencv there is a seperate continuumio dockerfile for python 3 if you need that as well here 's an image that is built on ubuntu 16.04 with python2 python3 opencv you can pull it using docker pull chennavarri/ubuntu_opencv_python here 's the dockerfile provided in the same dockerhub repo mentioned above that will install opencv for both python2 and python3 on ubuntu 16.04 and also sets the appropriate raw1394 link copied from https //github.com/chennavarri/docker-ubuntu-python-opencv some additional instructions for people newly starting with docker in the directory where you put this dockerfile build the docker image as docker build -t ubuntu_cv once the image is built you can check by doing docker images you can start a docker container as docker run -t -i ubuntu_cv latest to install opencv latest in docker the steps are similar to linux version just the symlink path is different this works for me click here to upload your image max 2 mib cancel and add another image you can also provide a link from the web log in by clicking post your answer you agree to our terms of service privacy policy and cookie policy 2019 stack exchange inc
