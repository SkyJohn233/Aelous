Thank you for posting your query, I'll be more than glad to help you out. I understand that you keep receiving the same fax over and over again from your HP LaserJet Pro MFP M127fw. Don't worry as I have a few steps that should help fix this issue. Please follow the steps to restore the printer to its factory defaults. And here's the step by step guide for you: Restore the factory-set defaults: Restoring the factory-set defaults returns all of the product and network settings to the factory defaults. It will not reset the page count, tray size, or language. To restore the product to the factory-default settings, follow these steps. CAUTION: Restoring the factory-set defaults returns all of the settings to the factory defaults, and it also deletes any pages that are stored in the memory. LCD control panel: 1. From the product control panel, press the Setup button. 2. Open the Service menu. 3. Select the Restore Defaults option, and then touch the OK button. The product automatically restarts. Touchscreen control panel: 1. From the Home screen on the product control panel, touch the Setup button. 2. Touch the Service menu. 3. Select the Restore Defaults option, and then touch the OK button. The product automatically restarts. Let me know how that works. I hope you have a good day ahead.
