center or right justify text it would be useful to be able to right justify or center justify text as far as i can tell the only possibility is left justification https //ggbm.at/559111 hello i do this i hope it helps you saludos https //ggbm.at/559123 http //wiki.geogebra.org/en mathmagic 's complicated construction works well seems crazy that one has to go through such gymnastics but it 's effective i 'm not sure if the justifying is the real problem a text object is attached to its positional point by the bottom left-hand corner corner 1 if it was possible to attach it to the bottom right-hand corner corner 2 this i think would be a useful solution i see i guess that what the request is for then centering text left/right would be attaching it to the midpoint between the two corners this is a reply to a post from november 2012 about centering or justifying text has there been no improvement is it that so few people would like to see the placement of text enhanced/improved or has it indeed happened and i just do n't know where to look if you want to have many movable objects with some text attached to them typically meant for younger children not being able to center align text makes it very cumbersome good idea more people should vote i really would like this feature right-aligned if you have a text that show a number between -100 and 100 you want the one-place to remain in the same position all the time and sometimes i have much longer text 3x 2x 5 17 the length of the text varies a lot 0x invisible the method i explain in other your post works for longer texts you can also use the option in tabletext to right-align numbers
