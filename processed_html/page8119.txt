A: The door has frequently been used as a form of pseudo-shield throughout many pieces of Minecraft content. It feels like the most appropriate item to use, given that there is no actual shield item. Q: Will you add more patterns, or would you consider adding the ability to add new patterns? A: We will certainly be adding more patterns, including some that are not item symbols. If you have suggestions, feel free to let us know. We are considering the addition of a cfg file, which would allow players to add their own designs, however we still have some things to iron out before we get to that. Q: Will this mod work on servers? A: Yes, this mod should be compatible with servers. If you would like to use this mod on a server, please make sure you have Minecraft Forge installed on your server, and that the server, and all players have this mod installed. Q: Can I use this mod in my modpack? A: Sure, provided that credit to Darkhax is given, and that the modpack is freely available to anyone who wishes to use it. Q: What happens if I remove this mod, but banners are in the world? A: All modded patterns will become completely transparent on banners. If you ever wish to re-enable these textures, simply install the mod again. Farewell everyone o/ now my banner looks epic   good work   love it!
