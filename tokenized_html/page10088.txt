houses in a finnish record-breaking pace vantaa wants to become a city where people can afford to live the city has begun to implement several measures for curbing apartment construction costs with deputy mayor juha-veikko nikulainen ncp who is in charge of land use a record-breaking number of over 2,000 apartments are set to be built the city has granted more building permits for this year than in a decade one of the fresh cost-effective abodes is kaunis bertta which was completed in myyrmäki late last year it is a chunky 8-storey building that had smaller costs due to restricted parking spots for example due to relaxed parking norms the parking garage fits the bottom floor and the apartment building was located on a small supplemental building plot we were drawn to the practicality of this apartment there is no wasted space within the 61 square metres and the apartment works well for two people describes fresh returnee heikki linsiö he is originally from helsinki he moved back to vantaa from pieksämäki with his wife to spend his retired years he did not have to pay a helsinki-level price for his home having a warm space in the basement is a luxury as i am used to having to dig the car out of the snow though due to the small plot there are no guest spots linsiö describes construction company ncc which was in charge of bertta s construction benefited from vantaa s policy of speeding up apartment zoning the city first put a tender for the plots among the construction companies and then worked on the plans together kaunis bertta was accompanied by two similar cost-effective houses according to the development director of the venture at ncc ilkka alvoittu the entire construction project appears to be completed within three years the city of vantaa if any can claim its promise on inexpensive apartments the working process must be record-breaking in finnish history. vantaa s momentum in executing inexpensive apartments is increased by the fact that there are many suburbs built in the 1970s for supplementary construction although the berttas are mass produced like many suburban houses they have been made more interesting by varying the locations of windows and balconies the mistakes of the horrendous 1970s will not be repeated and the cityscape is looked after alvoittu observes kivistö which is close to the railway and still in its early phase is one of the areas where vantaa now requires one parking space per 130 living square metres this cuts the apartment s price by 5,000-20 000 euro last year the average price per square metre in new apartment buildings was 4,964 euro and 3,824 euro in terrace houses with the opportunity to jump in a bus or walk to the store within a kilometre s radius fewer cars are required nikulainen

researcher of urban economy and living seppo laakso believes in the functionality of vantaa s policy vantaa already holds the image of being the place of residence for normal working middle-class people. once the ring rail line is completed in 2015 a huge zone where apartments and working places can be interlaced into an urban environment will be available laakso believes that vantaa should be
