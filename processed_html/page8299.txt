FSM300 datasheet - The FSM30X is a compact IMU module based on Hillcrestâ€™s The FSM30X is a compact IMU module based on Hillcrestâ€™s BNO080 9-axis SiP. The FSM30X incorporates the BNO080, a 32.768 kHz crystal and passive components into a compact module form factor that can be quickly and easily integrated into a design. The FSM30X provides all the motion based outputs available on the BNO080. It does not support environmental sensors. < strong > Features: < /strong >  BNO080 IMU sensor, 32.768 kHz crystal, Passive components (capacitors and resistors), Four host interface options, 20 mm x 25 mm 18-pin PCB module The is a compact IMU module based on Hillcrest's BNO080 9-axis SiP. The FSM30X incorporates the a 32.768 kHz crystal and passive components into a compact module form factor that can be quickly and easily integrated into a design. The FSM30X provides all the motion based outputs available on the BNO080. It does not support environmental sensors. The BNO080 datasheet is reference [3]. Figure 1: FSM30X Module A description of each pin is listed in Figure 2. For pins with internal pullups/pulldowns the value of the pullup resistor 34 k and the value of the pulldown resistor 6.2 k.

The FSM30X supports all four of the host interfaces implemented by the BNO080. Schematics showing typical connections for each interface are shown in the following figures. Figure 3: I2C Connection Example As shown in Figure 3, the I2C bus requires pullup resistors. The value of these resistors should be in the range 4.7 k.
