was reported that a gun and some cocaine was found and 23 people were arrested most of them because of suspected violation of immigration laws further it was reported that four of the prostitutes were between 14 and 15 years old the brothel was not fined however since the girls who were from africa looked older and carried fake documents showing an older age a bizarre story was reported in august 2005 two women 19 and 29 years old had rented two rooms in the pascha and announced over the internet that they would pay any man 50 euros for sex the goal was to find out who could have more partners in one day in the end they had sex for 11 hours with a total of 115 men and about 1,700 others had to be turned away the german tabloid bild turned the story into a headline the next day the women insisted that they had paid the men from their own vacation money and had not received any compensation from bild or pascha the 19-year-old woman later worked in the club brothel of pascha before the 2006 fifa world cup in germany muslims protested that the brothel insulted islam when it advertised using a 24-metre-high by 8-metre-wide poster mounted on the side of its building showing a half-naked woman and the flags from all of the countries which qualified for the world cup including those of muslim nations the slogan on the poster read die welt zu gast bei freundinnen the world as guest with girlfriends a pun on the slogan for that year 's world cup die welt zu gast bei freunden the world as guest with friends the protesters compared the poster to the jyllands-posten muhammad cartoons in response to the protests and threats of violence which began on 2006-04-21 the owners blacked out the flags of saudi arabia and iran both of which include words from the quran though the flag of tunisia which does not show any scriptural text was left alone in march 2007 the pascha announced that senior citizens above the age of 66 would receive a discount during afternoons half of the price of 50 euros for a normal session would be covered by the house in september 2007 a turkish customer tried to set fire to the pascha by igniting gasoline in the entrance area he also carried
