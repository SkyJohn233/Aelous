Effect of various doses (12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg, po) of GutGard was studied on gastric ulcers in pylorus ligation-, cold-restraint stress- andindomethacin induced gastric mucosal injury in rats. Anti-ulcer activity wasevaluated by measuring the ulcer index, gastric content, total acidity, and pH ofgastric fluid. GutGard dose dependently decreased gastric content, total acidity,ulcer index and increased pH of gastric fluid in pylorus ligation ulcer model. Incold-restraint stress- and indomethacin induced ulcer models all the doses ofGutGard decreased the ulcer index and increased the pH of gastric fluid. Theantioxidant activity was evaluated by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity(ORAC) assay. GutGardT exhibited potent antioxidant activity with highhydrophilic and lipophilic ORAC value. GutGard possessed anti-ulcerogenicproperties that might be afforded via cytoprotective mechanism by virtue of itsantioxidant properties. These results supported the ethnomedical uses of licoricein the treatment of gastric ulcer. ><
