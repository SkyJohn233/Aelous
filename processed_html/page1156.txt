George Mackay Brown poem, Rose Street, Edinburgh | Cut steelâ€¦ | Flickr new icn message flickr-free-ic 3d pan white Cut steel panels, part of a series arranged in the windows of a building in Rose Street as a graphic representation of George Mackay Brown's poem 'Beachcomber'. By artist Astrid Jaekel, installed 2013. Edinburgh can claim Mackay Brown as its own, although the Orcadian only spent four years there (1956-60) while studying at the University as a mature MA student. His connection with Rose Street is strong: he met 20-year-old Stella Cartwright in the Abbotsford Bar in 1957; he later proposed to her in early 1960; and his 'Four Poems for Stella' were published in the University magazine Gambit later that year. The engagement was later broken off but he and Stella remained firm friends until she died in 1985. typical border (deleted) 5y spuddie7 5y Arnim Schulz 5y Iain 5y =Nahemoth= (absent for a while) 5y La magia de la luz 5y
