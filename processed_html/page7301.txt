Belle Epoque - Belgium: Brussels The economical crisis in Europe of 1884 was especially severe in Belgium, the condition of the working class more difficult                        and the population density higher than in the other countries of the continent. The liberal government overthrew in that year and                        with it disappeared the regime, which had ruled over Belgium since its independence in 1830. The Catholics established their                        government while the socialists began to organise themselves in mass movements - in 1885 the Belgian Labour Party was founded.

These events caused many young intellectuals to join the Labour Party, among them three lawyers, Jules Destr e,                        Emile Vandervelde and Max Hallet, who persuaded the party's executive committee to order the construction of the new Popular House                        (Maison du Peuple) from  Victor Horta  (1861-1947). Afterwards, Max Hallet                        asked Horta to design the plans for his residence in avenue Louise; together with the Antwerp socialist Camille Huysmans, Hallet                        played an important role in the foundation of the Brussels Institute for Decorative Arts in 1926.

Since                        these artists were enthusiasts of the Art Nouveau, their socialist friends sided with this modern                        architecture style, like Louis Bertrand, deputy and mayor of Schaerbeek, who saw to it that most of                        the public buildings in his town were built in that style (e.g. he ordered the construction of all                        new schools from Henry Jacobs (1864-1935), a pupil of Horta).

Moreover,                        the social tensions of 1884 caused the emergence of a new type of man in the bourgeois elite: A new generation, inspired of the                        spirit of progress, took charge of the control of financial and commercial affairs, most of them being engineers who had participated                        in establishing the administration of the ancient colonies, like Van Eetvelde, Aubecq, Tassel and Solvay, and now becoming                        the most important customers of Horta - their houses are still to be admired in Brussels.
