Hymen ? Covering vaginal hole? | Yahoo Answers I really don &# x27;t see a vaginal hole , my hymen Is covering it ?? Is it because I &# x27;m a virgin and it  needs to break ?? In order to see it  completely ?all i see down there when i check is a hymen that &# x27;s very noticable no hole -.- I do get periods tho so obviously I have one but I can &# x27;t see it First, google around, there &# x27;s line drawings of potential hymen variations that will inform you without scarring your mind.  Keep your terms medical and you &# x27;ll get useful information.   It would be rare to have a micropore hymen, but it &# x27;s does happen.  If you &# x27;ve had a period, you know there &# x27;s an opening.  It &# x27;s possible that it &# x27;s super small or not where it normally would be, but it &# x27;s more likely you &# x27;re just not looking hard enough.  Get a large mirror and a flashlight.   Look toward the top of the entrance of your vagina, generally the hymen is cresent moon shaped and the opening is more towards the upper front of the vagina.  Closer to your face than butt, see what I &# x27;m saying.  Look there, press downwards towards the butt.  If by spreading the inner labia and pressing the hymen downwards you truly see no opening, or you see a super small opening that doesn &# x27;t allow a pinkie finger, or you see any hymenal variation that &# x27;s not gonna work in the long run, you just need to see a gyno and get their opinion.  It &# x27;s very thin tissue, it &# x27;s not a big deal to fix if you are the rare chick with a micropore or septate hymen.
