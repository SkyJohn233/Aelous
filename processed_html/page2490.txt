Having been outclassed in both one-day internationals so far, Bangladesh will need to dig deep if they are to secure a consolation victory in the final match. Overview New Zealand v Bangladesh 3rd ODI University Oval, Dunedin Wednesday, 20 February; 11.00am local, 10.00pm GMT JUST IN: Bangladesh all-rounder Mahmudullah and New Zealand pacer Trent Boult have been fined for breaching ICC Code of Conduct. Details ‚è¨ https://t.co/WppGEDiGWp pic.twitter.com/HipGUBRWAZ With the series already conceded, Bangladesh will look to make tweaks to eke out a consolation victory in the final game in Dunedin . It will be no easy task. Not with Mohammad Mithun, their most consistent batsman in the series, likely to be ruled out for the game with a hamstring injury. Mithun scored a fifty in each game, and was by far the most solid-looking. Senior player Mushfiqur Rahim is also grappling with the resurfacing of an earlier rib injury, and has been under observation. He reportedly didn't practice with the team ahead of the match, and his participation is uncertain. Bowlers,  @Martyguptill  star in New Zealand's series-clinching win! The hosts chase down Bangladesh's 226 by eight wickets in the second ODI at the Hagley Oval. #NZvBAN  REPORT üîΩ https://t.co/Uz6NRa0Rn8 pic.twitter.com/2B5RARzZH5 Bangladesh's batting has looked pretty frail as is, and if these two are unable to participate in the match, then they will have their task cut out. They will want the experienced Tamim Iqbal and Mahmudullah to step up. Both have failed to get starts in the two games so far. Youngsters like Liton Das and Soumya Sarkar also need to take more responsibility. Sarkar has got starts in both games, but hasn't turned them into knocks of substance. For New Zealand's bowlers, it provides a chance to further assert their dominance. Trent Boult, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry and Mitchell Santner have all been among the wickets and will look to add to their tally. In the batting department, New Zealand will be missing captain Kane Williamson, who has been rested. But the Bangladesh bowlers can't afford to rest easy for it's not Williamson who has caused them grief, but Martin Guptill. The right-handed opener has scored hundreds in both games, and would like to extend the streak. His 118 in the second ODI in Christchurch was fluent, coming off just 88 deliveries. New Zealand too have their batting concerns, though, particularly about Guptill's fellow-opener. Henry Nicholls hasn't quite been able to establish himself at the position. So The team are set to give Colin Munro another go, while Nicholls is likely to bat at No.3. Munro has a mediocre record in ODIs ‚Äì 1138 runs from 50 games at an average of 25.28 ‚Äì and will want a big score ahead of CWC19. Also, after a ordinary series against India before this, New Zealand's middle order hasn't really been tested. In both games, the hosts have lost just two wickets in their chase, leaving little to nothing for the middle-order men to do. If Bangladesh's bowlers can make an early opening, they might be able to expose that weakness. "He was brilliant, dominant, certainly in this game in terms of taking the momentum from the previous game. The number of back-to-back hundreds he scores is freakish." Kane Williamson on Martin Guptill ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/NcMnZyQvTV pic.twitter.com/f8aoYI2x1y Key players Martin Guptill (New Zealand):¬† The opener has been in quite the mood, scoring a total of 235 runs from the two games and losing his wicket just once. He certainly wouldn't mind another hundred. Bangladesh's bowlers will feel like they have a chance to test New Zealand if they get him out early. Tamim Iqbal (Bangladesh):¬† The opener has been one of Bangladesh's most reliable batsmen over the years and he will be keen to show his mettle in the third game after a couple of poor knocks. If he gets going, the visitors can be sure to have a solid platform, which they have missed so far. Conditions The weather is expected to be cool in Dunedin. There's not too much rain on the radar, but the chances of brief interruptions can't be ruled out. The pitch at the venue is known for producing some high-scoring affairs, but there could also be something in it for the quicks.
