Vernon teachers put positive messages on doors WASHINGTON COUNTY, Fla. (WJHG/WECP) -  Some teachers in Vernon have found a unique way to inspire their students. Vernon Middle School teachers have started putting positive messages all around the school, especially in the restrooms and locker rooms. VMS staff got the idea for the vinyl messages from a Facebook post from some teachers in Alabama. The sayings range from "Happy Girls are the Prettiest" in the girls' restroom, to "No Pain, No Gain" in the boys' restroom.  "We want them to know that they're wonderful and they're awe-inspiring and they can achieve anything, so I just think these subliminal reminders everywhere they go across campus can help carry that message," Principal Kim Register said. Register said they also plan on putting messages outside teachers' doors. If you'd like to get involved, Register said there are several ways you can do so. You can donate vinyl, help put the signs on doors, or volunteer as a mentor with the students at VMS.
