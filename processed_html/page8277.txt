Do I need the latest version of  SSE  LODGEN for  DynDOLOD ? It has the following changes in patcnotes (aside from SVR support): - LOD generation improvements - optionally generate trees as Objects LOD How to properly install it with  DynDOLOD  (if the answer is yes?) No. What a silly question. Jarl Posted  28 April 2018 - 05:00 PM Hey Sheson, your firstborn load screen art need an RS-Children patch ;) Prisoner Posted  01 May 2018 - 03:30 PM Is it alright if I use the first file here: https://www.nexusmod.../3333?tab=files Instead of the file below that says " DynDOLOD ." That way I can have the 1k near lods and the 512 far lods... Edited by belis1453, 01 May 2018 - 03:30 PM.

Prisoner Posted  01 May 2018 - 08:41 PM So it wouldn't matter that they are 1k near lods and 512 far lods? They'd all be "rendered" to whatever text. size I put in TEX GEN?

I'm attempting to use  DynDOLOD  but am having a bit trouble getting it to complete generation. DynDOLOD  ver: 2.36 x64 MO  2.1.2 In short, after 29-30 mins of work, the program is throwing a "System Error. Code: 5.  Access is denied". I'm not sure if this is a permissions issue, or an issue with generating the LOD files. The output folder is neither located within the game folder nor  MO . There are files generated within the output folder (to the tune of 2.4 GB) before the program hangs, so if it's a permissions issue I'm not seeing it. Also worth noting, the error occurs in the same location each time: ... Dragon King Posted  07 May 2018 - 01:54 AM TheMalazan, on 06 May 2018 - 4:08 PM, said: Greetings. Sorry for the bother.

The access problem has most likely nothing to do with  ELFX , those lines are probably just from the report about plugins causing texture flicker because of the large reference bugs. You will need to post/upload the entire log, there might be hints above that report. The cause is probably that some file(s) can not be read or written because of  UAC , Antivirus or they are used by other programs.

UAC  was off already, so I shut down Defender and made sure every folder/file on that disk had security settings open for everyone. Something worked as the program was able to complete its task. As an aside, when I closed  DynDOLOD  I received an "Exception EAccessViolation in module DynDOLODx64.exe at 0000000000D065D0 in module 'DynDOLODx64.exe'. Read of address FFFFFFFFFFFFFF"....or something like that. The files were saved successfully, though, and I haven't had any problems. Thanks again for the reply and creating the program in the first place. Edited by TheMalazan, 08 May 2018 - 09:51 AM.

Can I do lodgen just for base mod that i want/those who need lod generate, and after that just install all others? I mean, if i do lodgen after i install all my mods then  dyndolod  be hard connect to them. For example it be needed such mods like music rework or SkyTEST animals and predator to work. But they is totally different area mods. And if i want to turn some off them off, I will need reinstall all dyndo over again. Edited by sheson, 10 May 2018 - 08:53 AM. Prisoner Posted  10 May 2018 - 10:42 AM sheson, on 10 May 2018 - 05:52 AM, said: The most likely reason is that something is preventing read access to a nif file (loose or in a BSA). Could be  UAC , antivirus or  MO  depending on install and output folders or maybe another program still has a nif open and blocks it. Quote Read the tips in the Manual at the bottom of the Generating LOD section. Understand that just because a mod may not make changes directly relevant to LOD, any mod that does any world changes can possibly end up as a master in the  DynDOLOD  plugins so correct overwrite orders for records and such are kept. Typically such mods added later should overwrite the  DynDOLOD  plugins -  LOOT  is good at taking care of that, but change priority manually if required. Edited by Alvaro, 10 May 2018 - 10:43 AM.
