lemon-buttermilk ice pops recipe epicurious.com reviews 17 make it again would you make this recipe again for example boston ma tart light and refreshing a perfect summer dessert i took a cue from the previous reviews and chopped the lemon zest finely as possible i really like lemon zest so i didn x27 t mind crunching through the little bits of it but if you x27 re not a huge fan of zest i x27 d suggest leaving it out also i made this as a sorbet instead of as popsicles i just dumped the mixture into my ice cream maker and it came out great i x27 ll definitely be making this again these are delicious and refreshing i cringed when i saw lemon combinedwith buttermilk..not the case this anamazing combination absolutelydelicious delicious as other raters suggested iblended the mixture to make the pieces ofzest very small the only reason i gave therecipe 3 forks is i actually thought it wastoo sweet next time i make it i will reducethe sugar i double or triple this recipe and put it in the ice cream maker one ice pop serving is never enough yummm perfect i too was a little unsure of the buttermilk but now can x27 t imagine the lemon without it i used lowfat buttermilk and it was fine with fewer calories these are unbelievable if my friend nancy hadn x27 t told me that i should try them i would have passed the recipe right by the ingredients don x27 t exactly look delicious but don x27 t let the ingredient list throw you off the pops are excellent and they reminded me of key lime pie on a stick i can x27 t believe that i have failedtotell ya x27 ll how wonderful these are i made them quite some time ago andwas searching through my recipe boxfor this.i will be making them next weekendfor friends they will never believehow easy and great they taste yes even with buttermilk in it it is sorta gross in a filling sort of way this recipe was simple and delicious to avoid the problem with the x27 ribbons x27 of peel i grated the lemon peel and ran it through my food processor because i love the taste of lemon zest and had no problems with pieces of peel getting stuck in my teeth these were the hit of the fourth of july party i took them to these were really good and simple to make i used half the amount of buttermilk and did the other half with coconut milk very tasty i made these simply because i had a jug of buttermilk in the fridge and needed to use it but wow were they great i too skipped the lemon peel i x27 ve also put the mixture into my ice cream mixer and it was yummy yummmmmmmm we were in a hurry and made without the lemon peel but they were still quite lemony and quite delicious everyone loved these my 9-year-old has made them many times since we first tried them the buttermilk is a great taste addition we think they x27 re better than lemon sorbet or sherbet be sure to grate peel very finely or you x27 ll have what my 5-year-old calls popsicles with strings these are amazing pops i am too totally addicted to them i did them three times now i did all three recipes of that section and these are by far the best ones- don x27 t lose your time over the blueberry ones these are fabulous and addictive they taste unusual not like buttermilk don x27 t think they are a good choice for younger children though because they are quite lemony i loved these and my uncle said they were the best popsicle he x27 d ever had in his life the kids weren x27 t as fond of them it was the lemon peel i think but the adults really enjoyed them become a better cook instantly with this weekly report of our ten most helpful tips tricks
