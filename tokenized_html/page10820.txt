empty hi becky this looks so delicious can t wait to try it out on thanksgiving this year i am wondering are there any parts of this recipe aside from the pie shell that i can prepare ahead of time for example would it make sense to prep the batter the night before and store it in the fridge or would that make a big difference in the outcome thanks so much in advance sounds so delicous if i am really in a bind can i use a boxed fudge brownie mix i just wonder if enough or the correct size for the pie crust thanks i haven t done it that way but i do know it would absolutely work with that batter you could always just bake up any excess separately got ta love a good pie recipe pies from scratch are a true testimony of love agree made this for dessert tonight delicious and very easy but i had to bake mine for at least twice as long maybe because i used a deep-dish pie shell not sure if the size either maybe it was only 8 and even after all that time not fully baked in the center but i figured it had enough heat to kill the salmonella lets s hope it could have been the depth of the pie dish for sure i m glad you loved it hi i m becky hardin here at the cookie rookie you will find
