tree species of eight genera in gallery forests this rare picea chihuahuana tree community covers an area no more than 300 ha and has been subject of several studies involving different topics such as ecology genetic structure and climate change the overall aim of these studies was to obtain a dataset for developing management tools to help decision makers implement preservation and conservation strategies however this unique forest tree community may also represent an excellent subject for helping us to understand the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes in determining community structure and dynamics the aflp technique and species composition data were used together to test the hypothesis that species diversity is related to the adaptive genetic structure of some dominant tree species picea chihuahuana pinus strobiformis pseudotsuga menziesii and populus tremuloides of the picea chihuahuana tree community at fourteen locations the hill numbers were used as a diversity measure the results revealed a significant correlation between tree species diversity and genetic structure in populus tremuloides because the relationship between the two levels of diversity was found to be positive for the putative adaptive aflp detected genetic and species structures of the tree community were possibly simultaneously adapted to a combination of ecological or environmental factors the present findings indicate that interactions between genetic variants and species diversity may be crucial in shaping tree communities species diversity and genetic diversity the most basic elements of biodiversity have long been treated as separate topics although populations evolve within a community context 1 2 recent studies on community genetics and ecology have suggested that genetic diversity is not completely independent of species diversity 3 4 5 and may be correlated in three main ways a by a parallel process in which simultaneous responses of both levels of diversity to environmental factors may support a positive relationship 4 6 b species diversity may be causally controlled by genetic diversity within component species 7 and c genetic diversity may be causally affected by the diversity and relative abundance of coexisting species if the species diversity of a community influences the selection system 8 with a negative association 3 although several diversity indices have been described very few are regularly applied in ecological studies e.g the species richness index 9 the shannon index 10 and the simpson index 11 however many indices can be transformed into members of a family of explicit diversity measures also known as hill numbers or family 12 13 or r x000e9 nyi-diversity 14 15 16 17 picea chihuahuana mart x000ed nez chihuahua spruce is an endemic species listed as x0201c endangered x0201d on the red list and by the mexican official standard 18 19 forty populations of chihuahua spruce including about 43,000 individuals have been identified in three separate clusters in the sierra madre occidental the clusters occurred at elevations ranging from 2,100 to 3,000 m a.s.l and with average temperatures between 9 and 12 x000b0 c 20 in the sierra madre occidental chihuahua spruce grows in areas with precipitation ranging from 600 mm to 1,300 mm 21 chihuahua spruce preferentially inhabits areas of rough terrain located on hillsides and canyons in northwest- to northeast-facing areas with slopes ranging from 35 to 80 at the margins of streams and rivers 22 23 this species is often associated with tree species of the genera pinus quercus abies pseudotsuga populus prunus juniperus and cupressus forming gallery forests 20 22 24 this rare pine-spruce-cedar community hereafter referred to as the picea chihuahuana tree community covers an area no more than 300 ha it has remained in its original condition due to its isolated location at high elevations in very rugged mountains 20 25 the picea chihuahuana tree community has been the subject of several studies involving different topics such as ecology 20 22 26 genetic structure 25 27 28 29 30 31 and climate change 32 65 the overall aim of these studies was to obtain a dataset for developing management tools to help decision makers to implement preservation and conservation strategies 33 however this unique forest tree community may also represent an excellent model for helping us to understand the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes in determining community structure and dynamics 33 34 the amplified fragment length polymorphism aflp technique and species composition data were used together to test the hypothesis that species diversity is related to adaptive genetic structure of some dominant tree species picea chihuahuana pinus strobiformis pseudotsuga menziesii and populus tremuloides of the picea chihuahuana tree community at fourteen locations we confirm that the field studies provide the specific location of study table 1 no vertebrate studies were carried out field permit was granted by semarnat mexico http //www.semarnat.gob.mx/ the study area was located in the sierra madre occidental in the states of durango and chihuahua in order to determine relationship between tree species diversity and genetic structure fourteen study sites were considered table 1 figure 1 one plot of 50 x000d7 50 m 0.25 ha was established in the center of each site pinus strobiformis pseudotsuga menziesii and populus tremuloides were not presented in all plots for a complete list of the tree species composition and frequencies in the fourteen plots see qui x000f1 ones-p x000e9 rez et al 69 the target tree species picea chihuahuana was fully scored i.e all seedlings saplings and trees were measured for analysis of the genetic structure needles were sampled from a total of 194 trees and 475 seedlings and saplings x0003c 7 cm diameter at breast height dbh from natural regeneration of picea chihuahuana in the fourteen selected plots from 17 x02013 53 individuals per plot in 2010 x02013 2012 further investigations were carried out on 44 trees and 85 saplings of pinus strobiformis in twelve plots from 3 x02013 17 individuals per plot 17 trees and 46 saplings obtained by natural regeneration of pseudotsuga menziesii in six sites from 10 x02013 11 individuals per plot and 18 trees and 58 saplings from natural regeneration of populus tremuloides in seven sites from 8 x02013 13 individuals per plot in the picea chihuahuana tree community dna data were obtained by the amplified fragment length polymorphism aflp aflp fingerprints were established according to the protocol described by vos et al 35 due to the very large conifer genome the original protocols were modified for the three conifer species by using a larger number of adaptors restriction/ligation 6x and primers pre-aflp and selective aflp 6x the dna was extracted by use of the qiagen dneasy96 plant kit and digested with the restriction enzymes ecori 5 x02032 -gactgcgtaccaattcnnn-3 x02032 and msei 5 x02032 -gatgagtcctgagtaannn-3 x02032 pcr amplification was carried out with double-stranded ecori and msei adaptors ligated to the end of the restriction fragments to produce template dna in pre-aflp amplification the pcr products were treated with the primer combination e01/m03 ecori-a/msei-g the reaction was initiated at 72 x000b0 c for 2 min followed by 20 cycles each consisting of 94 x000b0 c for 10 sec 56 x000b0 c for 30 sec and 72 x000b0 c for 2 min and a final step at 60 x000b0 c for 30 min selective amplification was carried out with the fluorescent-labeled fam primer pair e35 ecori -aca and m70 msei-gct for picea chihuahuana and the fluorescent-labeled fam primer pair e35 and m63+c msei-gaac for pseudotsuga menziesii pinus strobiformis and populus tremuloides the fourth selective base was added to reduce the high number of weak signals the selective pcr cycling started at 94 x000b0 c for 2 min followed by 10 cycles each consisting of 10 sec at 94 x000b0 c 30 sec at 65 x000b0 c and 2 min at 72 x000b0 c. the 65 x000b0 c annealing temperature of the first cycle was subsequently reduced by 1 x000b0 c for the next 10 cycles and continued at 56 x000b0 c for 30 sec for the remaining 23 cycles and finished with a final extension step at 60 x000b0 c for 30 min all pcr reactions were conducted in a peltier thermal cycler ptc-200 version 4.0 mj research the amplified restriction products were resolved electrophoretically in a genetic analyzer abi 3100 16 capillaries along with the internal size standard genescan 500 rox fluorescent dye rox from applied biosystems the size of the aflp fragments was determined with the genescan 3.7 and genotyper 3.7 software packages applied biosystems 70 although it is possible to poolplex aflps we have found that the simultaneous analysis of aflps sometimes lowers the quality of patterns leading to problems with scoring thus we used only one primer combination in our first approach with the mexican tree species under study scoring was fully automated and only strong and high quality fragments were considered only fragments above the signal threshold of 50 minimum peak height according to abi manual and with a maximum peak width of 1.0 minimum peak size of 75 maximum peak size of 450 tolerance +/ x02212 bp of 0.4 and a minimum peak-peak distance of 0.5 were considered quality and reproducibility were checked by reference samples on each plate and independent repetition replicate pcrs of at least 16 samples i.e minimum 16 individuals per randomly chosen tree species all replicates showed the same aflp pattern as in the first analyses particularly concerning the adaptive loci due to slight differences in pcr the automatic scoring system identified fragments close to the minimum peak height of 50 as different these fragments were not included in further analyses to prevent mislabelling similarly sized fragments of different loci as one locus we checked the adaptive loci manually and found that the size of the fragment varied by less than 0.1 finally four binary aflp matrices were created from the presence code 1 or absence code 0 at potential band positions each band detected corresponded to the presence of a dominant genetic variant plus phenotype with unknown mode of inheritance of this potential band position detected fragment length named genetic variant x02018 1 x02019 36 37 the absence of a band reflected the presence of only recessive genetic allelic variants at the given position locus named genetic variant x02018 2 x02019 loci with frequencies of genetic variant x0003c 0.05 or x0003e 0.95 were excluded from further analyses relative frequencies at each aflp-based locus f were computed on the basis of the analysis of picea chihuahuana pinus strobiformis pseudotsuga menziesii and populus tremuloides specimens from the above-mentioned plots considered as a function of a hill numbers x003bd a 12 used as diversity measures describe a variant profile for each frequency distribution the most illustrative values of the subscript a in such a diversity profile are a x0200a x0200a 0 where the diversity equals the total number of variants a x0200a x0200a 2 as the effective number and a x0200a x0200a x0221e where only the most frequent variant determines the diversity amount of prevalent variant 13 p is the relative frequency of a variant i hill numbers can be used as explicit diversity measures at both species and genetic levels of diversity 2 4 formally p is the relative frequency of a variant i to represent the tree species diversity profile v sp a we selected the described diversities applied to each location thus each location of the p. chihuahuana tree community was characterized by the total number of tree species species richness v sp,0 effective number of tree species simpson index v sp,2 and the number of prevalent tree species v sp x0221e in the sampling plots x003bd a was also used to calculate the diversity of genetic variants considering only the x0201c effective number x0201d of genetic variants x02018 1 x02019 and x02018 2 x02019 v g,2 at each aflp locus a bias correction was carried out for v g,2 using the factor n/ n-1 13 in addition the mean genetic diversity per aflp locus v mean,2 was determined for each species as an arithmetic average of v g,2 values for all loci gene flow random drift selection and mutation create patterns of genetic differentiation although distinction between these factors by aflp analysis may be difficult and additional information may be required such as the use of different genetic markers e.g microsatellites however extremely high or low genetic differentiation at very few aflp loci suggests that diversifying forces are acting non-randomly differential selection or non-recurrent mutation or uniformly similar selection regimes in all populations 38 such aflp loci under natural selection outlier aflp loci were detected using bayescan v2.1 software 39 40 which was based on the multinomial dirichlet model and uses a reversible jump markov chain monte carlo rjmcmc algorithm to produce posterior distributions when the results showed a positive value of the locus-specific component x003b1 and a posterior probability x0003e 0.95 we expected differential selection whereas negative x003b1 values with posterior probabilities x0003e 0.95 indicated possible balancing or purifying selection 39 41 the factors of the chain and of the model were as follows output number of iterations 5,000 thinning interval size 10 pilot runs 20 length of pilot runs 5,000 additional burn in 50,000 prior odds for the neutral model 10 lower boundary for uniform prior on the inbreeding coefficients f is 0 and the higher boundary for uniform prior on f is 1 the differentiation parameter x003b4 and its p z x02265 x003b4 value as well as randomly chosen reassignments 38 were applied to test for non-randomly acting diversifying forces at the fourteen locations of the picea chihuahuana tree community sampled the relationships between tree species diversity x003bd sp a and the genetic variant x02018 2 x02019 f vr genetic diversity x003bd g,2 at each aflp locus and mean genetic diversity per aflp locus x003bd mean,2 for each species were measured separately by the covariation c described by gregorius et al 38 additionally c values between the number of the four tree species dbh x02265 7 cm per plot n and the variables x003bd sp a x003bd mean,2 x003bd g,2 and f vr at putative outlier aflp loci under differential selection were calculated because of the special mathematical structure of the diversity measures used and the frequency of genetic variant x02018 2 x02019 f vr at each aflp locus it was considered meaningful to look for methods of detecting types of covariation that were monotonous but not necessarily linear the covariation c varied between -1 and 1 where c x0200a x0200a 1 referred to an entirely positive covariation and c x0200a x0200a x02212 1 to a strictly negative covariation when the denominator was zero c was undefined 38 formally in order to test the possibility that the observed degrees of covariation c x003bd sp a x x003bd g,2 c x003bd sp a x x003bd mean,2 c x003bd sp x f vr c n x x003bd sp c n x x003bd mean,2 c n x x003bd g,2 and c n x f vg at putative outlier aflp loci were only produced by random events rather than directed forces a one-sided permutation test was performed here 5,000 permutations 42 we preselected only putative outlier aflp loci under differential selection false discovery rates fdr x0003c 0.05 and a posterior probability x0003e 0.95 with statistical significance of covariation c between species diversity x003bd sp a and both relative frequency of recessive genetic variant f vr and genetic diversity x003bd g,2 and a positive value of the locus-specific component x003b1 considering fdr as the expected proportion of false positives between outlier markers bonferroni correction 43 both for these outlier aflp loci and for c x003bd sp a x x003bd g,2 and c x003bd sp x f vr we selected the outlier aflp loci with the five highest posterior probabilities after bonferroni correction the new modified critical p value significance level x0200a x0200a 0.01 was calculated by dividing the critical p value here the significance level x0200a x0200a 0.05 by the number of comparisons hypotheses m x0200a x0200a 5 if the observed x003b4 was larger than 99.6 of imitated x003b4 s i.e p x0003c 0.004 after bonferroni correction and six hypotheses m x0200a x0200a 6 see below in the two-sided permutation test we expected non-randomly acting diversifying forces differential selection as causes of the differentiation among the fourteen sampled plots see details in 38 44 the aflp primer combination yielded 243 polymorphic bands of 75 x02013 450 base pairs across all individuals of picea chihuahuana while the respective numbers of bands for pinus strobiformis pseudotsuga menziesii and populus tremuloides were 250 207 and 237 overall 34 x02013 169 aflp bands were found per picea individual on average 112 25 x02013 149 per pinus individual on average 83 37 x02013 140 per pseudotsuga individual on average 87 and 20 x02013 137 per populus individual on average 64 table 2 shows mean genetic diversity per aflp locus x003bd mean,2 in populations and across all population of the four tree species studied based on the aflp loci recovered the highest genetic diversities in picea chihuahuana and populus tremuloides were found in the northern locations and the highest genetic diversities in pinus strobiformis and pseudotsuga menziesii was found in the southern populations according to the outlier analysis provided by the bayescan software differential selection significantly affected 6.0 of aflps in picea chihuahuana 1.1 in pinus strobiformis 4.9 of aflps in populus tremuloides and 0.5 in pseudotsuga menziesii table 3 before bonferroni correction of the critical p value for covariations c x003bd sp a x x003bd g,2 and c x003bd sp x f vr we found only 16 probably adaptive aflps in populus tremuloides 76 of all adaptive aflps in populus tremuloides associated with tree species diversity c x003bd sp a x x003bd g,2 and c x003bd sp x f vr were positive in populus tremuloides table 4 figure 2 after bonferroni correction of the critical p value for c x003bd sp a x x003bd g,2 and c x003bd sp x f vr positive covariations c between species diversity x003bd sp a and genetic variant x02018 2 x02019 f vr as well as genetic diversity x003bd g,2 were observed at the putatively adaptive aflps 209 and 210 in populus tremuloides tables 2 and 3 we found moderately positive covariation c between species diversities x003bd sp a and mean genetic diversity per aflp locus x003bd mean,2 for picea chihuahuana and moderately to strongly positive covariation for pseudotsuga menziesii and populus tremuloides however these values were not significant after bonferroni correction table 5 finally the covariation c between number of the tree species per plot n and x003bd sp 2 and x003bd g 2 at the putative adaptive aflp 210 was significantly positive for populus tremuloides before bonferroni correction c n x x003bd sp,2 x0200a x0200a +0.95 p x0200a x0200a 0.02 c n x x003bd g,2 210 x0200a x0200a +0.90 p x0200a x0200a 0.03 however the relationships between n and x003bd mean,2 x003bd g,2 at aflp locus 209 and f vg at the aflp loci 209 and 210 were moderate c x0200a x0200a +0.65 +0.73 x02212 0.57 and x02212 0.61 and statistically non-significant p x0200a x0200a 0.18 0.14 0.19 and 0.17 for populus tremuloides the differentiation x003b4 value for the fourteen sampled plots of picea chihuahuana tree community was 0.583 with a p z x02265 x003b4 value lower than 0.000001 assuming that the mapped markers used in this study reflect the whole genome 0.5 x02013 6.0 of aflp loci affected by possible differential selection were detected in the four tree species sampled from the picea chihuahuana tree community in the sierra madre occidental mexico previous studies of interspecific variation in quercus petraea and quercus robur 45 picea abies 46 fagus sylvatica 47 and pinus monticola 48 in other parts of the world showed similar proportions of putative genetic aflp loci caused by selection 12.7 2.5 x02013 3.3 0.4 and 12.0 respectively on a worldwide scale the discovery of probably adaptive loci has increasingly been reported across ecological gradients in various species 48 the results of this study clearly show that species diversity x003bd sp a was positively and significantly only related to genetic variant x02018 2 x02019 f vr and genetic diversity x003bd g,2 at two putatively adaptive aflps in populus tremuloides in the picea chihuahuana tree community under study table 4 a large proportion of putative adaptive aflp 76 in populus tremuloides was always positively but statistically non-significantly associated with species diversity table 4 together these results demonstrated that populus tremuloides evolve within a community context the number of populus tremuloides trees per plot n explained the positive relationship between tree species diversity and mean multilocus genetic diversity per aflp locus because population size has been positively related to mean genetic diversity 66 the populus tremuloides trees were more frequent in locations of higher tree species diversity the highest tree species diversity and tree density were found in the most humid and coldest climate on the sierra madre occidental in durango 67 the optimal climate conditions for populus tremuloides in forests of durango 68 however we can not explain why n was positively correlated with genetic diversity by differential selection at the putatively adaptive aflp 210 thus we can only speculate as to why the genetic structure at the putative adaptive aflp 209 and 210 of populus tremuloides was strongly correlated with species diversity in the tree community under study this may have been due to the dioecious nature mating system 49 50 low genome size x0223c 550 mbp 51 and/or the pioneering strategy of the quaking poplar which is the most widely distributed tree species in north america 52 and displays higher genetic adaptation to different environmental conditions than species of other genera 53 54 the relationship between the two levels of diversity was positive for detected putatively adaptive aflp table 4 thus the genetic 29 47 55 56 57 and species structures 58 in the tree community were possibly simultaneously adapted to a combination of ecological or environmental factors 6 3 31 this conclusion appears plausible because the values for differentiation x003b4 among the fourteen sampled locations under study in the picea chihuahuana tree community also indicate a strong effect of non-randomly acting diversifying forces differential selection on species diversity 44 however genetic differentiation may also be directly affected by the differential genetic response 59 to competition with other tree species 60 the positive but non-significant relationships between tree species diversity and the mean genetic diversity per aflp locus including all aflps found in three tree species under study table 5 implied selection table 3 that may affect higher multilocus genetic diversity and thus drive individual specialization 61 the present observations also support the findings of 7 i.e that the decrease in species diversity is lower in communities with higher within-population genetic diversity perhaps the locations that are rich in both tree species and genetic diversity table 2 27 69 were the oldest i.e they spent more time to enrich new genetic variants and species 62 the present findings indicate the existence of correlations between genetic and species diversity as the two most important levels of biodiversity 2 and that interactions between genetic variants and species diversity may be crucial in shaping tree communities 30 59 63 64 thus the present results may contribute to a better understanding of the concurrence of evolutionary and ecological processes for determining community structure and dynamics 33 34 and thus help to develop preservation and conservation strategies for this rare tree species community 33 however further study is needed to detect the complex variable local characteristics that influence both genetic and species diversity in the picea chihuahuana tree community 31 raw data used in this work xlsx we thank dr. oleksandra kuchma for excellent technical assistance this study was supported by joint funding
