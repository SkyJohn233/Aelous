Somatic embryogenesis in loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda) and Douglas fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii): improving culture initiation and growth with MES pH buffer, biotin, and folic acid | SpringerLink This service is more advanced with JavaScript available, learn more at  http://activatejavascript.org Advertisement Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture January 2005 ,  Volume 80,  Issue 1 ,                         pp 91–103  |  Cite as Loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda  L.) somatic embryogenesis initiation was improved by supplementing the initiation medium with the pH buffer agent 2( n -morpholino)ethanesulphonic acid (MES) at 250 mg l −1 , folic acid at 0.5 mg  l 1 , and biotin at 0.05 mg l −1 . MES and vitamins increased the percentage of explants with extruded tissue that continued the initiation process to form embryogenic tissue. The increase in initiation was about 12%. Initiation of 12 open-pollinated families averaged 38.5%, which is 16% higher than initiation on medium without these additives. When tested with 18 control-pollinated families, initiation averaged 26.3%. Basal medium contained a combination of modified 1/2 P6 salts, activated carbon (AC) at 50 mg  −1 , Cu and Zn adjusted to compensate for adsorption by AC, 1.5% maltose, 2% myo-inositol, 500 mg l −1  casamino acids, 450 mg l −1  glutamine, 2 mg l −1  NAA, 0.63 mg l −1  BAP, 0.61 mg l −1  kinetin, 3.4 mg l −1  silver nitrate, 10 μM 8-Br-cGMP, 0.1 μM brassinolide, and 2 g l −1  Gelrite. Early-stage embryo growth and initiation in Douglas-fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii  (Mirb.) Franco) were also improved in the presence of these additives. activated carbon 6–benzylaminopurine Douglas-fir ( Pseudot-suga menziesii  (mirb.)
