American Eagle Ditches The Airbrushing For Refreshingly Real Men Underwear Campaign | NewNowNext Do we like pictures of hot, muscular boys in their underwear? Yes. But is it the best way to market to the average man who deserves to feel every bit as sexy as a model does? Not so much.  That s why  American Eagle  is joining companies like  Axe Body Spray  in shifting towards campaigns that promote healthy body images and a more diverse idea of masculinity.  The new underwear campaign is called  #aerieman , and uses the tagline  The real you is beautiful  in order to advertise to a more well-rounded audience.  #aerieman introduces us to four men, including one who actually is a perfectly sculpted model, in a promotional series of videos that are as weird as they are inspiring.  Great style to me is when anyone feels comfortable in what they wear,  said Kelvin, from the middle of his giant bubble bath.  Meanwhile an aerieman named Devon talks with a stereotypical stoner accent as he bounces around in his marijuana leaf undies.
