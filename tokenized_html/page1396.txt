scientists computers and airplanes kaczynski 's bombs killed three people and injured dozens now officials are selling his property online the unabomber eluded federal officers from 1978 — when he sent his first package bomb — until 1996 when a tip from his brother david led the fbi to a remote shack in montana where ted kaczynski was arrested the case was one of the longest and most expensive in fbi history it was significant because it terrorized this country for 18 years says albert najera u.s. marshal for the eastern district of california after kaczynski pleaded guilty to setting 16 bombs and was sentenced to life in prison the courts looked into disposing of his assets to pay 15 million in restitution now clearly we do n't expect to make anywhere close to 15 million najera says but whatever it is that we get back will in fact go directly back to the victims the most popular items so far the iconic hooded sweatshirt and aviator sunglasses depicted in the unabomber police sketch for so many years handwritten and typed copies of his 35,000 word manifesto the smith corona typewriter he used and academic records from harvard 'murderabilia najera says the unabomber captivated people because he 's one of the country 's first modern-day domestic terrorists bernie madoff shirley cunningham dwight 'malachi york it changed the way that we got on the airplanes it changed the way that we dealt with mail coming into our institutions he says it was very significant at the time and still is some are glad the auction is moving forward others are n't happy kaczynski is getting more notoriety but it 's clear regardless that these murderabilia auctions generate a lot of attention a lot of these people have found a place in pop culture says john hickey a consignment director with heritage auctions they transcend quote 'criminals heritage based in dallas has sold bonnie and clyde wanted posters john dillinger 's wooden gun and letters from lee harvey oswald hickey says they 're generally high-ticket items so who 's buying the collectors i suspect are going to be almost universally male — and guys certainly over 40 and maybe 50 and fairly affluent i suspect hickey says and they 're going to want to have something that they can pull out at a cocktail party or whatever and make conversation with in june of 1995 kaczynski sent his manifesto industrial society and its future to the new york times and the washington post threatening to mail more bombs if the papers did n't publish the manuscript after much debate — and an fbi recommendation — they published u.s marshals office of public affairs/flickr hide caption a few crime memorabilia websites already exist but these kinds of items are not generally available on ebay anymore david schmid a professor at the university at buffalo is the author of a book about serial killers in american culture he says these auctions raise questions about whether they promote criminals — or whether they help the victims so people who participate in it are basically having to sort of be honest with themselves and say i 'm interested in this material not for any justifiable reason just because i find it fascinating he says and that 's something a lot of people are not prepared to do so that 's the reason murderabilia and something like the sale of kaczynski 's possessions makes people nervous schmid says he has no problem with the sale as a way for victims to get some compensation the initial bidding on kaczynski 's personal items was slow but it has picked up the auction runs until june 2 — and experts say serious bidders are n't likely to get involved until the last couple of days catch up on the latest headlines and unique npr stories sent every weekday by subscribing you agree to
