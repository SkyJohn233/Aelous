Farhart, Tilda [corrected to Farhat, Tilda]. The current study examined socio-demographic variability in adolescent substance use and the mediating roles of maternal knowledge, paternal knowledge and peersubstance use. The data were obtained from the United States records (N = 8,795) of the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children 2005/2006 Survey, in grades 6through 10. The analyses employed multiple indicator multiple cause andstructural equation models. Adolescent substance use was measured by frequencies of alcohol use, being drunk, and cigarette and marijuana use in the past month.Peer influence had a direct influence on adolescent substance use. Maternalknowledge had both direct and indirect influences on adolescent substance usethrough its negative association with substance-using peers, whereas paternalknowledge only had an indirect influence. Parental knowledge and peer substanceuse totally mediated differences in adolescent substance use by grade;differences between Caucasian and African-American or Hispanic adolescents; anddifferences between adolescents from two-parent families and those fromsingle-mother, single-father or mother-stepfather families. Parental knowledgeand peer substance were important mediators which largely accounted forvariability in the prevalence of adolescent substance use by grade,race/ethnicity, and family structure.
