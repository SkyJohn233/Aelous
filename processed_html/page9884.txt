Foot Popping - TV Tropes Follow TV Tropes http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootPopping Go To Traditionally, when a woman and a man kiss, the woman tends to lift her leg to show just how hot and heavy it's getting or to demonstrate how much she trusts the man to hold her up. A somewhat  Discredited Trope  nowadays, and mostly crops up in parody (though the alert viewer will still sometimes see it played straight, mainly in romantic comedies), as often a man will do this to  emphasize his effeminate side , or both people  will do it at once . The  Trope Namer  is the film version of  The Princess Diaries . Though the trope originated earlier, one of  The Hays Code 's dumber demands required that women, in love scenes, at all times have  "at least one foot on the floor"  (in other words, no love scenes in bed). It may even be an example of  Getting Crap Past the Radar  if it's combined with  Something Else Also Rises . However, this euphemistic meaning has become mostly forgotten over time, to the point where it can be used without a single raised eyebrow in children's programming, or conversely, seen in  pornographic  movies, where the need for euphemism is lessened, to say the least. According to some commentary on the topic (including several actresses from  The Golden Age of Hollywood ), this trope was/is also intended as a way for starlets to  draw attention to their shapely legs . This is borne out by numerous posed "cheesecake" photographs from the 1930's through the 1960's where the model is striking a Foot Popping-style pose without actually kissing anyone (generally she's the only one in the picture). Many old hosiery advertisements (stockings and pantyhose) also used the trope in this way, to showcase their wares by calling attention to the legs wearing them. Often used as a  Modeling Pose .
