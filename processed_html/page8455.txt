Connected Sales - Atlantic Shipping A/S Last week, the Norwegian company Hopmark Havfiske AS from the island of Sm la, took a major step forward in its development by purchasing the pelagic trawler  " Ariadne " , ex.  " Her yfjord " , from Denmark. The ship is now called  " Fiskebank "  and has home port in Kristiansund. The acquisition of the new Fiskebank is a major upgrade for the company. The new Fiskebank was built in 2004 at Voldnes shipyard in Norway, and has the dimensions loa 53.00 m x beam 12.40 m. The plan is to rig it for double trawling and re-install a whitefish factory. At the same time the old Fiskebank, which was built in 1992, has been sold internally in Norway to the company H flu AS, and the vessel is now named  " H flu " . H flu AS ' s acquisition of Fiskebank is also a major upgrade for them compared to the old H flu, which was built in 1964. H flu have now got a newer, stronger and more updated vessel with a new and modern whitefish factory, and is expected to give a significantly improved operation and efficiency. In one of the photos you can see Fiskebank s (ex. Ariadne) new owner, Torkil Hopmark, and the former owner, Tamme Bolt, shake hands during the sales docking of the vessel last week. Atlantic Shipping A/S would like to congratulate and thank all involved parties for good cooperation during the sales and delivery process.
