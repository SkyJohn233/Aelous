Trial solutions were represented bytorsion angles. This means that bond angles for the dimer trial structures are kept fixed duringthe genetic algorithm optimization. Bond angle values were extracted from a 10 bpsense–antisense duplex model that was subjected to energy minimization by means ofa modified AMBER force field. A set of 63 proton–proton distance restraints definingthe methylene-acetal-linked thymine dimer was available. The genetic algorithm minimizesthe difference between distances in the trial structures and distance restraints. A largeconformational search space could be covered in the genetic algorithm optimization byallowing a wide range of torsion angles. The genetic algorithm optimization in all cases ledto one family of structures. This family of the methylene-acetal-linked thymine dimer in theduplex differs from the family that was suggested from distance geometry calculations. It isdemonstrated that the bond angle geometry around the methylene-acetal linkage plays animportant role in the optimization.
